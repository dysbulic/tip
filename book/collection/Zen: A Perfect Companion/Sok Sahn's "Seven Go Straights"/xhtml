<title>Sok Sahn's <q>Seven Go Straights</q></title>

<ol>
<li>Go straight, resting.</li>
<li>Go straight, put it all down.</li>
<li>Go straight, the cold, clear water of autumn.</li>
<li>Go straight, one mind for 10,000 years.</li>
<li>Go straight, cold ashes under a rotten log.</li>
<li>Go straight, incense burner in an old temple (very heavy, never moving).</li>
<li>Go straight, one line of incense smoke rising in the still air.</li>
</ol>

<p><q>One color, different function,</q> the Head Monk replied.</p>
<p><q>If you don't believe me, I'll show you.</q> The Head Monk then lit a stick of incence, placed it in the burner, and quietly watched it burn down. Then he died.</p>
<p>Many people exclaimed, <q>Ah, this great monk has also died!</q></p>
<p>But the attendant only patted the Head Monk's back slowly three times, saying <q>Sitting, die. Standing, die. Either way, no hinderance. But Sok Sahn's seven go straights' true meaning cannot be gotten, even in a dream.</q></p>
