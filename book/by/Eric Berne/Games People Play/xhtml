<p class=MsoNormal><i>Lots of scanning errors remain.</i></p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>THIS book is primarily designed to be a sequel to my book <i>Transactional
Analysis in Psychotherapy</i>, but has been planned so that it can be read and
understood independently. The theory necessary for the analysis and clear
understanding of games has been summarized in Part I. Part II contains
descriptions of the individual games. Part III contains new clinical and
theoretical material which, added to the old, makes it possible to understand
to some extent what it means to be game-free. Those desiring further background
are referred to the earlier volume. The reader of both will note that in
addition to the theoretical advances, there have been some minor changes in
terminology and viewpoint based on further thinking and reading and new
clinical material.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The need for this book was indicated by interested requests
from students and lecture audiences for lists of games, or for further
elaboration of games mentioned briefly as examples in a general exposition of
the principles of transac-tional analysis. Thanks are due in general to these
students and audiences, and especially to the many patients who exposed to
view, spotted or named new games; and in particular to Miss Barbara Rosenfeld
for her many ideas about the art and meaning of listening; and to Mr. Melvin
Boyce, Mr. Joseph Concannon, Dr. Franklin Ernst, Dr. Kenneth Everts, Dr. Gordon
Gritter, Mrs. Frances Matson, and Dr. Ray Poindexter, among others, for their
independent discovery or confirmation of the significance of many games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. Claude Steiner, formerly Research Director of the San
Francisco Social Psychiatry Seminars and presently in the Department of
Psychology at the University of Michigan deserves special mention on two counts.
He conducted the first experiments which confirmed many of the theoretical
points at issue here, and as a result of these experiments he helped considerably
in clarifying the nature of autonomy and of intimacy. Thanks are also due to
Miss Viola Lilt, the Secretary-Treasurer of the Seminars, and to Mrs. Mary N.
Williams, my personal secretary, for their continued help, and to Anne Garrett
for her assistance in reading the proof.</p>

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>For conciseness, the games are described primarily from the
male point of view unless they are clearly feminine. Thus the chief player is
usually designated as “he,” but without prejudice, since the same situation,
unless otherwise indicated, could as easily be outlined with “she,” mutatis
mutandis. If the woman’s role differs significantly from the man’s, it is
treated separately. The therapist is similarly without prejudice designated as “he.”
The vocabulary and viewpoint are primarily oriented toward the practicing clinician,
but members of other professions may find this book interesting or useful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Transactional game analysis should be clearly distinguished
from its growing sister science of mathematical game analysis, although a few
of the terms used in the text, such as “payoff,” are now respectably
mathematical. For a detailed review of the mathematical theory of games see
Games &amp; Decisions, by R. D. Luce and H. Raiffa.<sup>2</sup></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>1. Social Intercourse</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE theory of social intercourse, which has been outlined at
some length in <i>Transactional Analysis</i><sup>1</sup> may be summarized as
follows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spitz has found<sup>2</sup> that infants deprived of
handling over a long period will tend at length to sink into an irreversible
decline and are prone to succumb eventually to intercurrent disease. In effect,
this means that what he calls emotional deprivation can have a fatal outcome.
These observations give rise to the idea of stimulus-hunger, and indicate that
the most favored forms of stimuli are those provided by physical intimacy, a
conclusion not hard to accept on the basis of everyday experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An allied phenomenon is seen in grown-ups subjected to sensory
deprivation. Experimentally, such deprivation may call forth a transient
psychosis, or at least give rise to temporary mental disturbances. In the past,
social and sensory deprivation is noted to have had similar effects in individuals
condemned to long periods of solitary imprisonment. Indeed, solitary confinement
is one of the punishments most dreaded even by prisoners hardened to physical
brutality,<sup>3-4</sup> and is now a notorious procedure for inducing
political compliance. (Conversely, the best of the known weapons against
compliance is social organization.<sup>5</sup>)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On that biological side, it is probable that emotional and
sensory deprivation tends to bring about or encourage organic changes. If the
reticular activating system<sup>6</sup> of the brain stem is not sufficiently
stimulated, degenerative changes in the nerve cells may follow, at least
indirectly. This may be a secondary effect due to poor nutrition, but the poor
nutrition itself may be a product of apathy, as in infants suffering from
marasmus. Hence a biological chain may he postulated leading from emotional and
sensory deprivation through apathy to degenerative changes and death. In this
sense, stimulus-hunger has the same relationship to survival of the human
organism as food-hunger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, not only biologically but also psychologically and socially,
stimulus-hunger in many ways parallels the hunger for food. Such terms as
malnutrition, satiation, gourmet, gourmand, faddist, ascetic, culinary arts,
and good cook are easily transferred from the field of nutrition to the field
of sensation. Overstuffing has its parallel in overstimulation. In both
spheres, under ordinary conditions where ample supplies are available and a
diversified menu is possible, choices will be heavily influenced by an
individual’s idiosyncrasies. It is possible that some or many of these
idiosyncrasies are constitutionally determined, but this is irrelevant to the
problems at issue here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The social psychiatrist’s concern in the matter is with what
happens after the infant is separated from his mother. in the normal course of
growth. What has been said so far may be summarized by the “colloquialism”:<sup>7</sup>
“If you are not stroked, your spinal cord will shrivel up.” Hence, after the
period of close intimacy with the mother is over, the individual for the rest
of his life is confronted with a dilemma upon whose horns his destiny and
survival are continually being tossed. One horn is the social, psychological
and biological forces which stand in the way of continued physical intimacy in
the infant style; the other is his perpetual striving for its attainment. Under
most conditions he will compromise. He learns to do with more subtle, even
symbolic, forms of handling, until the merest nod of recognition may serve the
purpose to some extent, although his original craving for physical contact may
remain unabated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This process of compromise may be called by various terms,
such as sublimation; but whatever it is called, the result is a partial
transformation of the infantile stimulus-hunger into something which may be
termed recognition-hunger. As the complexities of compromise increase, each person
becomes more and more individual in his quest for recognition, and it is these
differentia which lend variety to social intercourse and which determine the
individual’s destiny. A movie actor may require hundreds of strokes each week
from anonymous and undifferentiated admirers to keep his spinal cord from
shriveling, while a scientist may keep physically and mentally healthy on one
stroke a year from a respected master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stroking” may be used as a general term for intimate
physical contact; in practice it may take various forms. Some people literally
stroke an infant; others hug or pat it, while some people pinch it playfully or
flip it with a fingertip. These all have their analogues in conversation, so
that it seems one might predict how an individual would handle a baby by
listening to him talk. By an extension of meaning, “stroking” may be employed
colloquially to denote any act implying recognition of another’s presence.
Hence a stroke may be used as the fundamental unit of social action. An
exchange of strokes constitutes a transaction, which is the unit of social intercourse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As far as the theory of games is concerned, the principle
which emerges here is that any social intercourse whatever has a biological
advantage over no intercourse at all. This has been experimentally demonstrated
in the case of rats through some remarkable experiments by S. Levine<sup>8</sup>
in which not only physical, mental and emotional development but also the
biochemistry of the brain and even resistance to leukemia were favorably
affected by handling. The significant feature of these experiments was that
gentle handling and painful electric shocks were equally effective in promoting
the health of the animals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This validation of what has been said above encourages us to
proceed with increased confidence to the next section.</p>

<h3>2. The Structuring Of Time </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Granted that handling of infants, and its symbolic
equivalent in grown-ups, recognition, have a survival value. The question is,
What next? In everyday terms, what can people do after they have exchanged
greetings, whether the greeting consists of a collegiate “Hi!” or an Oriental
ritual lasting several hours? After stimulus-hunger and recognition-hunger
comes structure-hunger. The perennial problem of adolescents is: “What do you
say to her (him) then?” And to many people besides adolescents, nothing is more
uncomfortable than a social hiatus, a period of silent, unstructured time when
no one present can think of anything more interesting to say than; “Don’t you
think the walls are perpendicular tonight?” The eternal problem of the human
being is how to structure his waking hours. In this existential sense, the
function of all social living is to lend mutual assistance for this project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The operational aspect of time-structuring may be called programing.
In has three aspects: material, social and individual. The most common,
convenient, comfortable, and utilitarian method of structuring time is by a
project designed to deal with the material of external reality: what is
commonly known as work. Such a project is technically called an activity; the
term “work” is unsuitable because a general theory of social psychiatry must recognize
that social intercourse is also a form of work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Material programing arises from the vicissitudes encountered
in dealing with external reality; it is of interest here only insofar as
activities offer a matrix for “stroking,” recognition, and other more complex
forms of social intercourse. Material programing is not primarily a social
problem; in essence it is based on data processing. The activity of building a
boat relies on a long series of measurements and probability estimates, and any
social exchange which occurs must be subordinated to these in order for the
building to proceed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Social programing results in traditional ritualistic or
semi-ritualistic interchanges. The chief criterion for it is local acceptability,
popularity called “good manners.” Parents in all parts of the world teach their
children manners, which means that they know the proper greeting, eating,
emunc-tory, courting and mourning rituals, and also how to carry on topical
conversations with appropriate strictures and reinforcements. The strictures
and reinforcements constitute tact or diplomacy, some of which is universal and
some local. Belching at meals or asking after another man’s wife are each
encouraged or forbidden by local ancestral tradition, and indeed there is a
high degree of inverse correlation between these particular transactions. Usually
in localities where people belch at meals, it is unwise to ask after the
womenfolk; and in localities where people are asking after the womenfolk, it is
unwise to belch at meals. Usually formal rituals precede semi-ritualistic
topical conversations, and the latter may be distinguished by calling them—pastimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As people become better acquainted, more and more individual
programing creeps in, so that “incidents” begin to occur. These incidents
superficially appear to be adventitious, and may be so described by the parties
concerned, but careful scrutiny reveals diat they tend to follow definite
patterns which are amenable to sorting and classification, and that the
sequence is circumscribed by unspoken rules and regulations. These regulations
remain latent as long as the amities or hostilities proceed according to Hoyle,
but they become manifest if an illegal move is made, giving rise to a symbolic,
verbal or legal cry of “Foul!” Such sequences, which in contrast to pastimes
are based more on individual than on social programing, may be called games.
Family life and married life, as well as life in organizations of various
kinds, may year after year be based on variations of the same game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To say that the bulk of social activity consists of playing
games does not necessarily mean that it is mostly “fun” or that the parties are
not seriously engaged in the relationship. On the one hand, “playing” football
and other athletic “games” may not be fun at all, and the players may be
intensely grim; and such games share with gambling and other forms of “play”
the potentiality for being very serious indeed, sometimes fatal. On the other
hand, some authors, for instance Huizinga,<sup>9</sup> include under “play”
such serious things as cannibal feasts. Hence calling such tragic behavior as
suicide, alcohol and drug addiction, criminality or schizophrenia “playing
games” is not irresponsible, facetious or barbaric. The essential
characteristic of human play is not that the emotions are spurious, but that
they are regulated. This is revealed when sanctions are imposed on an illegitimate
emotional display. Play may be grimly serious, or even fatally serious, but the
social sanctions are serious only if the rules are broken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pastimes and games are substitutes for the real living of
real intimacy. Because of this they may be regarded as preliminary engagements
rather than as unions, which is why they are characterized as poignant forms of
play. Intimacy begins when individual (usually instinctual) programing becomes
more intense, and both social patterning and ulterior restrictions and motives
begin to give way. It is the only completely satisfying answer to
stimulus-hunger, recognition-hunger and structure-hunger. Its prototype is the
act of loving impregnation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Structure-hunger has the same survival value as
stimulus-hunger. Stimulus-hunger and recognition-hunger express the need to
avoid sensory and emotional starvation, both of which lead to biological
deterioration. Structure-hunger expresses the need to avoid boredom, and
Kierkegaard<sup>10</sup> has pointed out the evils which result from
unstructured time. If it persists for any length of time, boredom becomes
synonymous with emotional starvation and can have the same consequences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The solitary individual can structure time in two ways:
activity and fantasy. An individual can remain solitary even in the presence of
others, as every schoolteacher knows. When one is a member of a social
aggregation of two or more people, there are several options for structuring
time. In order of complexity, these are: (1) Rituals (2) Pastimes (3) Games (4)
Intimacy and (5) Activity, which may form a matrix for any of the others. The
goal of each member of the aggregation is to obtain as many satisfactions as
possible from his transactions with other members. The more accessible he is,
the more satisfactions he can obtain. Most of the programing of his social
operations is automatic. Since some of the “satisfactions” obtained under diis
programing, such as self-destructive ones, are difficult to recognize in the
usual sense of the word “satisfactions,” it would be better to substitute some
more non-committal terra, such as “gains” or “advantages.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The advantages of social contact revolve around somatic and
psychic equilibrium. They are related to the following factors: (1) the relief
of tension (2) the avoidance of noxious situations (3) the procurement of
stroking and (4) the maintenance of an established equilibrium. All these items
have been investigated and discussed in great detail by physiologists, psychologists,
and psychoanalysts. Translated into terms of social psychiatry, they may be
stated as (O trie primary internal advantages (2) the primary external advantages
(3) the secondary advantages and (4) the existential advantages. The first
three parallel the “gains from illness” described by Freud: the internal
paranosic gain, the external paranosic gain, and the eplnosic gain,
respectively.11 Experience has shown that it is more useful and enlightening to
investigate social transactions from the point of view of the advantages gained
than to treat them as defensive operations. In the first place, the best
defense is to engage in no transactions at all; in the second place, the
concept of “defenses” covers only part of the first two classes of advantages,
and the rest of them, together with the third and fourth classes, are lost to
this point of view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most gratifying forms of social contact, whether or not
they are embedded in a matrix of activity, are games and intimacy. Prolonged
intimacy is rare, and even then it is primarily a private matter; significant
social intercourse most commonly takes the form of games, and that is the subject
which principally concerns us here. For further information about
rime-structuring, the author’s book on group dynamics should be consulted.</p>

<h1>Part I: Analysis of Games</h1>

<h2>Chapter One. Structural Analysis</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>OBSERVATION of spontaneous social activity, most productively
carried out in certain kinds of psychotherapy groups, reveals that from time to
time people show noticeable changes in posture, viewpoint, voice, vocabulary,
and other aspects of behavior. These behavioral changes are often accompanied
by shifts in feeling. In a given individual, a certain set of behavior patterns
corresponds to one state of mmd, while another set is related to a different psychic
attitude, often inconsistent with the first. These changes and differences give
rise to the idea of ego states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In technical language, an ego state may be described phenomenologically
as a coherent system of feelings, and operationally as a set of coherent
behavior patterns. In more practical terms, it is a system of feelings accompanied
by a related set of behavior patterns. Each individual seems to have available
a limited repertoire of such ego states, which are not roles but psychological
realities. This repertoire can be sorted into the following categories: (1) ego
states which resemble those of parental figures (2) ego states which are
autonomously directed toward objective appraisal of reality and (3) those which
represent archaic relics, still-active ego states which were fixated in early
childhood. Technically these are called, respectively, extero-psychic,
neopsychic, and archaeopsychic ego states. Colloquially dieir exhibitions are
called Parent, Adult and Child, and these simple terms serve for all but the
most formal discussions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The position is, then, that at any given moment each
individual in a social aggregation will exhibit a Parental, Adult or Child ego
state, and that individuals can shift with varying degrees of readiness from
one ego state to another. These observations give rise to certain diagnostic
statements. “That is your Parent” means: “You are now in the same state of mind
as one of your parents (or a parental substitute) used to be, and you are
responding as he would, with the same posture, gestures, vocabulary, feelings,
etc.” “That is your Adult” means: “You have just made an autonomous, objective
appraisal of the situation and are stating these thought-processes, or the
problems you perceive, or the conclusions you have come to, in a
non-prejudicial manner.” “That is your Child” means: “The manner and intent of
your reaction is the same as it would have been when you were a very little boy
or girl.” The implications are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. That every individual has had parents (or substitute
parents) and that he carries within him a set of ego states that reproduce the
ego states of those parents (as he perceived them), and that these parental ego
states can be activated under certain circumstances (exteropsychic
functioning). Colloquially: “Everyone carries his parents around inside of him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. That every individual (including children, the mentally retarded
and schizophrenics) is capable of objective data processing if the appropriate
ego state can be activated (neopsychic functioning). Colloquially: “Everyone
has an Adult.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. That every individual was once younger than he is now,
and that he carries within him fixated relics from earlier years which will be
activated under certain circumstances (archaeopsychic functioning).
Colloquially: “Everyone carries a little boy or girl around inside of him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this point it is appropriate to draw Figure I (A), which
is called a structural diagram. This represents, from the present viewpoint, a
diagram of the complete personality of any individual. It includes his
Parental, Adult, and Child ego states. They are carefully segregated from each
other, because they are so different and because they are so often quite
inconsistent with each other. The distinctions may not be clear at first to an
inexperienced observer, but soon become impressive and interesting to anyone
who takes the trouble to learn structural diagnosis. It will be convenient
henceforth to call actual people parents, adults or children, with no capital
letters; Parent, Adult and Child, capitalized, will be used when ego states are
referred to. Figure 1(B) represents a convenient, simplified form of the
structural diagram.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Structural Diagram       Simplified Form</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&lt;  FIGURE   1   &gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before we leave the subject of structural analysis, certain
complications should be mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. The word “childish” is never used in structural analysis,
since it has come to have strong connotations of undesir-ability, and of
something to be stopped forthwith or gotten rid of. The term “childlike” is
used in describing the Child (an archaic ego state), since it is more
biological and not prejudicial. Actually the Child is in many ways the most
valuable part of the personality, and can contribute to the individual’s life
exactly what an actual child can contribute to family life: charm, pleasure and
creativity. If the Child in the individual is confused and unhealthy, then the
consequences may be unfortunate, but something can and should be done about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. The same applies to the words “mature” and “immature.” In
this system there is no such thing as an “immature person.” There are only people
in whom the Child takes over inappropriately or unproductively, but all such
people have a complete, well-structured Adult which only needs to be uncovered
or activated. Conversely, so-called “mature people” are people who are able to
keep the Adult in control most of the time, but their Child will take over on
occasion like anyone else’s, often with disconcerting results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. It should be noted that the Parent is exhibited in two
forms, direct and indirect: as an active ego state, and as an influence. When
it is directly active, the person responds as his own father (or mother)
actually responded (“Do as I do”). When it is an indirect influence, he
responds the way they wanted him to respond (“Don’t do as I do, do as I say”).
In the first case he becomes one of them; in the second, he adapts himself to
their requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. Thus the Child is also exhibited in two forms: the
adapted Child and the natural Child. The adapted Child is the one who modifies
his behavior under the Parental influence. He behaves as father (or mother)
wanted him to behave: compliantly or precociously, for example. Or he adapts
himself by withdrawing or whining. Thus the Parental influence is a cause, and
the adapted Child an effect. The natural Child is a spontaneous expression: rebellion
or creativity, for example. A confirmation of structural analysis is seen in
the results of alcohol intoxication. Usually this decommissions the Parent
first, so that the adapted Child is freed of the Parental influence, and is
transformed by release into the natural Child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is seldom necessary, for effective game analysis, to go beyond
what has been outlined above as far as personality structure is concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E”o states are normal physiological phenomena. The human
brain is the organ or organizer of psychic life, and its products ate organized
and stored in the form of ego states. There is already concrete evidence for
this in some findings of Penficld and his associates.1-2 There are other
sorting systems at various levels, such as factual memory, but the natural form
of experience itself is in shifting states of mind. Each type of ego state has
its own vital value for the human organism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Child reside intuition,3 creativity and spontaneous
drive and enjoyment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Adult is necessary for survival. It processes data and
computes the probabilities which are essential for dealing effectively with the
outside world. It also experiences its own kinds of setbacks and
gratifications. Crossing a busy highway, for example, requires the processing of
a complex series of velocity data; action is suspended until the computations
indicate a high degree of probability for reaching the other side safely. The
gratifications offered by successful computations of this type afford some of
the joys of skiing, flying, sailing, and other mobile sports. Another task of
the Adult is to regulate the activities of the Parent and the Child, and to
mediate objectively between them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Parent has two main functions. First, it enables the individual
to act effectively as the parent of actual children, thus promoting the
survival of the human race. Its value in this respect is shown by the fact that
in raising children, people orphaned in infancy seem to have a harder time than
those from homes unbroken into adolescence. Secondly, it makes many responses
automatic, which conserves a great deal of time and energy. Many things are
done because “That’s the way it’s done.” This frees the Adult from the
necessity of making innumerable trivial decisions, so that it can devote itself
to more important issues, leaving routine matters to the Parent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus all three aspects of the personality have a high
survival and living value, and it is only when one or the other of them disturbs
the healthy balance that analysis and reorganization are indicated. Otherwise each_of
them, Parent, Adult, and Child, has a legitimate place in a full and productive
life.</p>

<h2>Chapter Two. Transactional Analysis</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE unit of social intercourse is called a transaction. If
two or more people encounter each other in a social aggregation, sooner or
later one of them will speak, or give some other indication of acknowledging
the presence of the others. This is called the transactional stimulus. Another
person will then say or do something which is in some way related to this
stimulus, and that is called the transactions/ response. Simple transactional
analysis is concerned with diagnosing which ego state implemented the
transactional stimulus, and which one executed the transactional response. The
simplest transactions are those in which both stimulus and response arise from
the Adults of the parties concerned. The agent, estimating from the data before
him that a scalpel is now the instrument of choice, holds out his hand. The
respondent appraises this gesture correctly, estimates the forces and distances
involved, and places the handle of the scalpel exactly where the surgeon expects
it. Next in simplicity are Child-Parent transactions. The fevered Child asks
for a glass of water, and the nurturing mother brings it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both these transactions are complementary; that is, the response
is appropriate and expected and follows the natural order of healthy human
relationships. The first, which is classified as Complementary Transaction Type
I, is represented in Figure 2A. The second, Complementary Transaction Type II,
is shown in Figure 2B. It is evident, however, that transactions tend to
proceed in chains, so that each response is in mm a stimulus. The first rule of
communication is that communication will proceed smoothly as long as
transactions are complementary, and its corollary is that as long as
transactions are complementary, communication can, in principle, proceed
indefinitely. These rules are independent of the nature and content of the
transactions; they are based entirely on the direction of the vectors involved.
As long as the transactions are complementary, it is irrelevant to the rule
whether two people are engaging in critical gossip (Parent-Parent), solving a
problem (Adult-Adult), or playing together (Child-Child or Parent-Child).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crossed Transaction! &lt;  FIGURE  3  &gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The converse rule is that communication is broken off when a
crossed transaction occurs. The most common crossed transactionn, and the one
which causes, and always has caused, most of the social difficulties in the world,
whether in marriage, love, friendship, or work, is represented in Figure 3A as
Crossed Transaction Type I. This type of transaction is the principal concern
of psychotherapists and is typified by the classical transference reaction of
psychoanalysis. The stimulus is Adult-Adult: e.g., “Maybe we should find out
why you’ve been drinking more lately,” or, “Do you know where my cuff links
are?” The appropriate Adult-Adult response in each case would be: “Maybe we
should. I’d certainly like to know!” or, On the desk.” If the respondent flares
up, however, the responses will be something like “You’re always criticizing
me, just like my father did,” or, “You always blame me for everything.” These
are both Child-Parent responses, and as the transacrional diagram shows, the
vectors cross. In such cases the Adult problems about drinking or cuff links
must be suspended until the vectors can be realigned. This may take anywhere
from several months in the drinking example to a few seconds in the case of
cuff links. Either the agent must become Parental as a complement to the
respondent’s suddenly activated Child, or the respondent’s Adult must be
reactivated as a complement to the agent’s Adult. If the maid rebels during a
discussion of dishwashing, the Adult-Adult conversation about dishes is finished;
there can only ensue either a Child-Parent discourse, or a discussion of a
different Adult subject, namely her continued employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Relationship Diagram &lt; FIGURE 4 &gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The converse of Crossed Transaction Type I is illustrated in
Figure 3B. This is the counter-transference reaction familiar to
psychotherapists, in which the patient makes an objective, Adult observation,
and the therapist crosses the vectors by responding like a parent talking to a
child. This is Crossed Transaction Type II. In everyday life, “Do you know
where my cuff links are?” may elicit: “Why don’t you keep track of your own
things? You’re not a child any more.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The relationship diagram in Figure 4, showing the nine possible
vectors of social action between an agent and a respondent, has some
interesting geometrical (topological) qualities. Complementary transactions
between “psychological equals” are represented by (1—I)2, (5—5)2 and (9—9)2.
There are three other complementary transactions: (2-4) (4-2), (3-7) (7-3) and
(6-8) (8-6). All other combinations form crossed transactions, and in most
cases these show up as crossings in the diagram: e.g., (3—7) (3—7), which
results in two speechless people glaring at each other. If neither of them
gives way, communication is finished and they must part. The most common
solutions are for one to yield and take (7—3), which results in a game of “Uproar”;
or better, (5—5)2, in which case they both burst out laughing or shake hands.
Simple complementary transactions most commonly occur in superficial working
and social relationships, and these are easily disturbed by simple crossed
transactions. In fact a superficial relationship may be defined as one which is
confined to simple complementary transactions. Such relationships occur in
activities, rituals and pastimes. More complex are ulterior transactions—those
involving the activity of more than two ego states simultaneously—and this
category is the basis for games. Salesmen are particularly adept at angular
transactions, those involving three ego states. A crude but dramatic example of
a sales game is illustrated in the following exchange:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Salesman;   “This one is better, but you can’t afford it.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Housewife: “That’s the one I’ll take.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The analysis of this transaction is shown in Figure 5A. The
salesman, as Adult, states two objective facts: “This one is better” and “You
can’t afford it.” At the ostensible, or social, level these are directed to the
Adult of the housewife, whose Adult reply would be: “You are correct on both
counts.” However, the ulterior, or—psychological, vector is directed by the
well-trained and experienced Adult of the salesman to the housewife’s Child.
The correctness of his judgment is demonstrated by the Child’s reply, which
says in effect: “Regardless of the financial consequences, I’ll show that
arrogant fellow I’m as good as any of his customers.” At both levels the
transaction is complementary, since her reply is accepted at face value as an
Adult purchasing contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A duplex ulterior transaction involves four ego states, and
is commonly seen in flirtation games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cowboy: “Come and see the barn.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Visitor:   “I’ve loved barns ever since I was a little girl.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> (a) An Angular Transaction            (b) A Duplex Transaction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ulterior Transactions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&lt;  FIGURE 5   &gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As shown in Figure 5B, at the social level this is an Adult
conversation about barns, and at the psychological level it is a Child
conversation about sex play. On the surface the Adult seems to have the
initiative, but as in most games, the outcome is determined by the Child, and
the participants may be in for a surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Transactions may be classified, then, as complementary or
crossed, simple or ulterior, and ulterior transactions may be subdivided into
angular and duplex types.</p>

<h2>Chapter Three. Procedures And Rituals</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>TRANSACTIONS usually proceed in series. These series are not
random, but are programed. Programing may come from one of three sources:
Parent, Adult or Child, or more generally, from society, material or
idiosyncrasy—Since the needs of adaptation require that the Child may be
shielded by the Parent or Adult until each social situation has been tested,
Child programing is most apt to occur in situations of privacy and intimacy,
where preliminary testing has already been done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The simplest forms of social activity are procedures and
rituals. Some of these are universal and some local, but all of them have to be
learned. A—procedure is a series of simple complementary Adult transactions
directed toward the manipulation of reality. Reality is defined as having two
aspects: static and dynamic. Static reality comprises all the possible arrangements
of matter in the universe. Arithmetic, for example, consists of statements
about static reality. Dynamic reality may be defined as the potentialities for
interaction of all the energy systems in the universe. Chemistry, for example,
consists of statements about dynamic reality. Procedures are based on data
processing and probability estimates concerning the material of reality, and
reach their highest development in professional techniques. Piloting an
airplane and removing an appendix are procedures. Psychotherapy is a procedure
insofar as it is under the control of the therapist’s Adult, and it is not a
procedure insofar as his Parent or Child takes over the executive. The
programing of a procedure is determined by the material, on the basis of
estimates made by the agent’s Adult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two variables are used in evaluating procedures. A procedure
is said to be efficient when the agent makes the best possible use of the data
and experience available to him, regardless of any deficiencies that may exist
in his knowledge. If the Parent or the Child interferes with the Adult’s data
processing, the procedure becomes contaminated and will be less efficient. The
effectiveness of a procedure is judged by the actual results. Thus efficiency
is a psychological criterion and effectiveness is a material one. A native assistant
medical officer on a tropical island became very adept at removing cataracts.
He used what knowledge he had widi a very high degree of efficiency, but since
he knew less than the European medical officer, he was not quite as effective.
The European began to drink heavily so that his efficiency dropped, but at first
his effectiveness was not diminished. But when his hands became tremulous as
the years went by, his assistant began to surpass him not only in efficiency,
but also in effectiveness. It can be seen from this example that both of these
variables are best evaluated by an expert in the procedures involved—efficiency
by personal acquaintance with the agent, and effectiveness by surveying the actual
results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the present viewpoint, a ritual is a stereotyped series
of simple complementary transactions programed by external social forces. An
informal ritual, such as social leave-taking, may be subject to considerable
local variations in details, although the basic form remains the same. A formal
ritual, such as a Roman Catholic Mass, offers much less option. The form of a
ritual is Parentally determined by tradition, but more recent “parental”
influences may have similar but less stable effects in trivial instances. Some
formal rituals of special historical or anthropological interest have two
phases: (1) a phase in which transactions are carried on under rigid Parental
strictures (2) a phase of Parental license, in which the Child is allowed more
or less complete transactional freedom, resulting in an orgy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many formal rituals started off as heavily contaminated
though fairly efficient procedures, but as time passed and circumstances
changed, they lost all procedural validity while still retaining their
usefulness as acts of faith. Trans-actionally they represent guilt-relieving or
reward-seeking compliances with traditional Parental demands. They offer a
safe, reassuring (apotropaic), and often enjoyable method of structuring time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of more significance as an introduction to game analysis are
informal rituals, and among the most instructive are the American greeting
rituals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1A:   “Hi!” (Hello, good morning.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1B:   “Hi!” (Hello, good morning.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2A:   “Warm enough forya?” (How are you?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2B:   “Sure is. Looks like rain, though.” (Fine. How are
you?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3A:   “Well, take cara yourself.” (Okay.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3B:   “I’ll be seeing you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4A:   “So long.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4B:   “So long.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is apparent that this exchange is not intended to convey
information. Indeed, if there is any information, it is wisely withheld. It
might take Mr. A fifteen minutes to say how he is, and Mr. B, who is only the
most casual acquaintance, has no intention of devoting that much time to
listening to him. This series of transactions is quite adequately characterized
by calling it an “eight-stroke ritual.” If A and B were in a hurry, they might
both be contented with a two-stroke exchange, Hi-Hi. If they were old-fashioned
Oriental potentates, they might go through a two-hundred stroke ritual before
settling down to business. Meanwhile, in the jargon of transactional analysis,
A and B have improved each other’s health slighdy; for the moment, at least, “their
spinal cords won’t shrivel up,” and each is accordingly grateful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This ritual is based on careful intuitive computations by
both parties. At this stage of their acquaintance they figure that they owe
eacb other exactly four strokes at each meeting, and not ofrener than once a
day. If they run into each other again shortly, say within the next half hour,
and have no new business to transact, they will pass by without any sign, or
with only the slightest nod of recognition, or at most with a very perfunctory
Hi-Hi. These computations hold not only for short intervals but over periods of
several months. Let us now consider Mr. C and Mr. D, who pass each other about
once a day, trade one stroke each—Hi-Hi—and go their ways. Mr. C goes on a month’s
vacation. The day after he returns, he encounters Mr. D as usual. If on this
occasion Mr. D merely says “Hi!” and no more, Mr. C will be offended, “his
spinal cord will shrivel slightly.” By his calculations, Mr. D and he owe each
other about thirty strokes. These can be compressed into a few transactions, if
those transactions are emphatic enough. Mr. D’s side properly runs something
like this (where each unit of “intensity” or “interest” is equivalent to a
stroke):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1D:  “Hi!” (1 unit.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2D:   “Haven’t seen you around lately.” (2 units.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3D:   “Oh, have you! Where did you go?” (5 units.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4D:   “Say, that’s interesting. How was it?” (7 units.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5D:   “Well,  you’re sure looking  fine.”   (4 units.)   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        “Did your family go along?” (4 units.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6D:   “Well, glad to see you back.” (4 units.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7D:  “So long.” (1 unit.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This gives Mr. D a total of 28 units. Both he and Mr. C know
that he will make up the missing units the following day, so the account is
now, for all practical purposes, squared. Two days later they will be back at
their two-stroke exchange, Hi-Hi. But now they “know each other better,” i.e.,
each knows the other is reliable, and this may be useful if they should meet “socially.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The inverse case is also worth considering. Mr. E and Mr. F
have set up a two-stroke ritual, Hi-Hi. One day instead of passing on, Mr. E
stops and asks: “How are you?” The conversation proceeds as follows:</p>

</table>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Mr. F hurries away, he thinks to himself: “What’s come
over him all of a sudden? Is he selling insurance or something?” In
transactional terms this reads: “All he owes me is one stroke, why is he giving
me five?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An even simpler demonstration of the truly transactional business-like
nature of these simple rituals is the occasion when Mr. G says “Hi!” and Mr. H
passes on without replying. Mr. G’s reaction is “What’s the matter with him?”
meaning: “I gave him a stroke and he didn’t give me one in return.” If Mr. H
keeps this up and extends it to other acquaintances, he is going to cause some
talk in his community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In borderline cases it is sometimes difficult to distinguish
between a procedure and a ritual. The tendency is for the layman to call
professional procedures rituals, while actually every transaction may be based
on sound, even vital experience, but the layman does not have the background to
appreciate that. Conversely, there is a tendency for professionals to rationalize
ritualistic elements that still cling to dieir procedures, and to dismiss
skeptical laymen on the ground that they are not equipped to understand. And
one of the ways in which entrenched professionals may resist the introduction
of sound new procedures is by laughing them off as rituals. Hence the fate of
Semmelweis and other innovators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The essential and similar feature of both procedures and rituals
is that they are stereotyped. Once the first transaction has been initiated,
the whole series is predictable and follows a predetermined course to a
foreordained conclusion unless special conditions arise. The difference between
them lies in the origin of the predetermination: procedures are programed by
the Adult and rituals are Parentally patterned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Individuals who are not comfortable or adept with rituals
sometimes evade them by substituting procedures. They can be found, for
example, among people who like to help the hostess with preparing or serving
food and drink at parties.</p>

<h2>Chapter Four. Pastimes</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>PASTIMES occur in social and temporal matrices of varying
degrees of complexity, and hence vary in complexity. However, if we use the
transaction as the unit of social intercourse, we can dissect out of
appropriate situations an entity which may be called a simple pastime. This may
be defined as a series of semi-ritualistic, simple, complementary transactions
arranged around a single field of material, whose primary object is to
structure an interval of time. The beginning and end of the interval are
typically signaled by procedures or rituals. The transactions are adap-tively programed
so that each party will obtain the maximum gains or advantages during the
interval. The better his adaptation, the more he will get out of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pastimes are typically played at parties (“social gatherings”)
or during the waiting period before a formal group meeting begins; such waiting
periods before a meeting “begins” have the same structure and dynamics as “parries.”
Pastimes may take the form described as “chit-chat” or they may become more
serious, e.g., argumentative. A large cocktail party often functions as a kind
of gallery for the exhibition of pastimes. In one corner of the room a few
people are playing “PTA,” another corner is the forum for “Psychiatry,” a third
is the theater for “Ever Been” or “What Became,” the fourth is engaged for “General
Motors,” and the buffet is reserved for women who want to play “Kitchen” or “Wardrobe.”
The proceedings at such a gathering may be almost identical, with a change of
names here and there, with the proceedings at a dozen similar parties taking
place simultaneously in the area. At another   dozen   in   a   different  
social   stratum,   a   different assortment of pastimes is underway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pastimes may be classified in different ways. The external determinants
are sociological (sex, age, marital status, cultural, racial or economic). “General
Motors” (comparing cars) and “Who Won” (sports) are both “Man Talk.” “Grocery,”
“Kitchen,” and “Wardrobe” are all “Lady Talk”—or, as practised in the South
Seas, “Mary Talk.” “Making Out” is adolescent, while the onset of middle age is
marked by a shift to “Balance Sheet.” Other species of this class, which are
all variations of “Small Talk,” are: “How To” (go about doing something), an
easy filler for short airplane trips; “How Much” (does it cost), a favorite in
lower-middle-class bars; “Ever Been (to some nostalgic place), a middle-class
game for “old hands” such as salesmen; “Do You Know” (so-and-so) for lonely
ones; “What Became” (of good old Joe), often played by economic successes and
failures; “Morning After” (what a hangover) and “Martini” (I know a better
way), typical of a certain kind of ambitious young person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The structural-transactional classification is a more
personal one. Thus “PTA” may be played at three levels. At the Child-Child
level it takes the form of “How Do You Deal with Recalcitrant Parents”; its
Adult-Adult form, “PTA” proper, is popular among well-read young mothers; with
older people it tends to take the dogmatic Parent-Parent form of “Juvenile
Delinquency.” Some married couples play “Tell Them Dear,” in which the wife is
Parental and the husband comes through like a precocious child. “Look Ma No
Hands” is similarly a Child-Parent pastime suitable for people of any age,
sometimes diffidently adapted into “Aw Shucks Fellows.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even more cogent is the psychological classification ol pastimes.
Both “PTA” and “Psychiatry” for example, may be played in eidier projective or
introjective forms. The analysis of “PTA,” Projective Type is represented in
Figure 6A, based on the following Parent-Parent paradigm:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A:   “There wouldn’t be all this delinquency if it weren’t for
broken homes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>B: “It’s not only that. Even in good homes nowadays the children
aren’t taught manners the way they used to be.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“PTA,” Introjective Type runs along the following lines (Adult-Adult):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>C:   “I  just don’t  seem   to have  what it   takes to be a
mother.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>D: “No matter how hard you try, they never grow up the way
you want them to, so you have to keep wondering if you’re doing the right thing
and what mistakes you’ve made.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Psychiatry” Projective Type takes the Adult-Adult form:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E: “I think it’s some unconscious oral frustration that
makes him act that way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>F: “You seem to have your aggressions so well sublimated.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 6B represents “Psychiatry,” Introjective Type,
another Adult-Adult pastime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>G:   “That painting symbolizes smearing to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>H:   “In my case, painting is trying to please my father.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides structuring time and providing mutually acceptable
stroking for the parties concerned, pastimes serve the additional function of
being social-selection processes. While a pastime is in progress, the Child in
each player is watchfully assessing the potentialities of the others involved.
At the end of the party, each person will have selected certain players he
would like to see more of, while others he will discard, regardless of how
skillfully or pleasantly they each engaged in the pastime. The ones he selects
are those who seem the most likely candidates for more complex relationships—that
is, games. This sorting system, however well rationalized, is actually largely
unconscious and intuitive.///s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a) Projectfye “PTA”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Juvenile Delinquency”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b) Introjectfve “Psychiatry” “Psychoanalysis”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PaitimM &lt;; FIGURE 6 &gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In special cases the Adult overrides the Child in the
selection process. This is most clearly illustrated by an insurance salesman
who carefully learns to play social pastimes. While he is playing, his Adult
listens for possible prospects and selects them from the players as people he
would like to see more of. Their adeptness at games or congeniality is quite
irrelevant to his process of selection, which is based, as in most cases, on
peripheral factors—in this instance, financial readiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pastimes, however, have a quite specific aspect of
ex-clusiveness. For example, “Man Talk” and “Lady Talk” do not mix. People
playing a hard hand of “Ever Been” (there) will be annoyed by an intruder who
wants to play “How Much” (for avocados) or “Morning After.” People playing
Projective “PTA” will resent the intrusion of Introjective “PTA,” although
usually not as intensely as the other way around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pastimes form the basis for the selection of acquaintances,
and may lead to friendship. A party of women who drop in at each other’s houses
every morning for coffee to play</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Delinquent Husband” are likely to give a cool reception to
a new neighbor who wants to play “Sunny Side Up.” If they are saying how mean
their husbands are, it is too disconcerting to have a newcomer declare that her
husband is just marvelous, in fact perfect, and they will not keep her long. So
at a cocktail party, if someone wants to move from one corner to another, he
must either join in the pastime played in his new location or else successfully
switch the whole proceeding into a new channel. A good hostess, of course,
takes the situation in hand immediately and states the program: “We were just
playing Projective ‘PTA.’ What do you think/’ Or: “Come now, you girls have
been playing ‘Wardrobe’ long enough. Mr. J. here is a
writer/politician/surgeon, and I’m sure he’d like to play ‘Look Ma No Hands.’
Wouldn’t you, Mr. ]f”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another important advantage obtained from pastimes is the
confirmation of role and the stabilizing of position. A role is something like
what Jung calls persona, except that it is less opportunistic and more deeply
rooted in the individual’s fantasies. Thus in Projective “PTA” one player may
take the role of tough Parent, another the role of righteous Parent, a third
the role of indulgent Parent and a fourth the role of helpful Parent. All four
experience and exhibit a Parental ego state, but each presents himself differently.
The role of each one is confirmed if it prevails—that is, if it meets with no
antagonism or is strengthened by any antagonism it meets or is approved by
certain types of people with stroking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The confirmation of his role stabilizes the individual’s
position, and this is called the existential advantage from the pastime. A position
is a simple predicative statement which influences all of the individual’s
transactions; in the long run it determines his destiny and often that of his
descendants as well. A position may be more or less absolute. Typical positions
from which Projective “PTA” can be played are: “All children are bad!” “All
other children are bad!” “All children are sad!” “All children are persecuted!”
These positions might give rise to the role of die tough, the righteous, the
indulgent and the helpful Parent, respectively. Actually a position is
primarily manifested by the mental attitude to which it gives rise, and it is with
this attitude that the individual undertakes the transactions which constitute
his role.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Positions are taken and become fixed surprisingly early,
from the second or even the first year to the seventh year of life—in any case
long before the individual is competent or experienced enough to make such a
serious commitment. It is not difficult to deduce from an individual’s position
the kind of childhood he must have had. Unless something or somebody intervenes,
he spends the rest of his life stabilizing his position and dealing with
situations that threaten it: by avoiding them, warding oft7 certain elements or
manipulating them provocatively so diat they are transformed from threats into
justifications. One reason pastimes are so stereotyped is that they serve such
stereotyped purposes. But the gains they offer show why people play them so
eagerly, and why they can be so pleasant if played with people who have
constructive or benevolent positions to maintain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A pastime is not always easy to distinguish from an
activity, and combinations frequently occur. Many commonplace pastimes, such as
“General Motors,” consist of what psychologists might call
Multiple-Choice—Sentence-Completion exchanges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A. “I like a Ford/Chevrolet/Plymouth better than a
Ford/Chevrolet/Plymouth because ....”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>B. “Oh. Well, I’d rather have a Ford/Chevrolet/Plymouth than
a Ford/Chevrolet/Plymouth because ....”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is apparent that diere may actually be some useful information
conveyed in such stereotypes,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few other common pastimes may be mentioned. “Me Too” is
often a variant of “Ain’t It Awful.” “Why Don’t They” (do something about it)
is a favorite among housewives who do not wish to be emancipated. “Then We’ll”
is a Child-Child pastime. “Let’s Find” (something to do) is played by juvenile
delinquents or mischievous grown-ups.</p>

<h2>Chapter Five. Games</h2>

<h3>1. Definition</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A GAME is an ongoing series of complementary ulterior transactions
progressing to a well-defined, predictable outcome. Descriptively it is a
recurring set of transactions, often repetitious, superficially plausible, with
a concealed motivation; or, more colloquially, a series of moves with a snare,
or “gimmick.” Games are clearly differentiated from procedures, rituals, and
pastimes by two chief characteristics: (I) their ulterior quality and (2) the
payoff. Procedures may be successful, rituals effective, and pastimes profitable,
but all of them are by definition candid; they may involve contest, but not
conflict, and the ending may be sensational, but it is not dramatic. Every
game, on the other hand, is basically dishonest, and the outcome has a
dramatic, as distinct from merely exciting, quality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It remains to distinguish games from the one remaining type
of social action which so far has not been discussed. An operation is a simple
transaction or set of transactions undertaken for a specific, stated purpose.
If someone frankly asks for reassurance and gets it, that is an operation. If
someone asks for reassurance, and after it is given turns it in some way to the
disadvantage of the giver, that is a game. Superficially, then, a game looks
like a set of operations, but after the payoff it becomes apparent that these
operations” were really maneuvers; not honest requests but moves in the game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the “insurance game,” for example, no matter what the
agent appears to be doing in conversation, if he is a hard player he is really
looking for or working on a prospect. What he is after, if he is worth his
salt, is to “make a killing.” The same applies to “the real estate game,” “the
paiama game” and similar occupations—Hence at a social gathering, while a
salesman is engaged in pastimes, particularly variants of “Balance Sheet,” his
congenial participation may conceal a series of skillful maneuvers designed to
elicit the kind of information he is professionally interested in. There are
dozens of trade journals devoted to improving commercial maneuvers, and which
give accounts of outstanding players and games (interesting operators who make
unusually big deals). Transactionally speaking, these are merely variants of
Sports Illustrated, Chess World, and other sports magazines.</p>

<p class=cont>As far as angular transactions are concerned—games which are
consciously planned with professional precision under Adult control to yield
the maximum gains—the big “con games” which flourished in the early 1900’s are
hard to surpass for detailed practical planning and psychological virtuosity.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What we are concerned with here, however, are the unconscious
games played by innocent people engaged in duplex transactions of which they
are not fully aware, and which form the most important aspect of social life
all over the world. Because of their dynamic qualities, games are easy to
distinguish from mere static attitudes, which arise from taking a position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The use of the word “game” should not be misleading. As explained
in the introduction, it does not necessarily imply fun or even enjoyment. Many
salesmen do not consider their work fun, as Arthur Miller made clear in his
play, The Death—of a Salesman. And there may be no lack of seriousness.
Football games nowadays are taken very seriously, but no more so than such
transactional games as “Alcoholic” or “Third-Degree Rapo.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The same applies to the word “play,” as anyone who has “played”
hard poker or “played” the stock market over a long period can testify. The
possible seriousness of games and play, and the possibly serious results, are
well known to anthropologists. The most complex game that ever existed, that of
“Courtier” as described so well by Stendhal in The Charterhouse of Parma, was
deadly serious. The grimmest of all, of course, is “War.”</p>

<h3>2. A Typical Game</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most common game played between spouses is col-.   loquially
called “If It Weren’t For You,” and this will be used to illustrate the
characteristics of games in general.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mrs. White complained that her husband severely restricted
her social activities, so that she had never learned to dance. Due to changes
in her attitude brought about by psychiatric treatment, her husband became less
sure of himself and more indulgent. Mrs. White was then free to enlarge the
scope of her activities. She signed up for dancing classes, and then discovered
to her despair that she had a morbid fear of dance floors and had to abandon
this project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This unfortunate adventure, along with similar ones, laid
bare some important aspects of the structure of her marriage. Out of her many
suitors she had picked a domineering man for a husband. She was then in a
position to complain that she could do all sorts of things “if it weren’t for
you.” Many of her women friends also had domineering husbands, and when they
met for their morning coffee, they spent a good deal of time playing “If It
Weren’t For Him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As it turned out, however, contrary to her complaints, her
husband was performing a very real service for her by forbidding her to do
something she was deeply afraid of, and by preventing her, in fact, from even
becoming aware of her fears. This was one reason her Child had shrewdly chosen
such a husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there was more to it than that. His prohibitions and her
complaints frequently led to quarrels, so that their sex life was seriously
impaired. And because of his feelings of guilt, he frequently brought her gifts
which might not otherwise have been forthcoming; certainly when he gave her
more freedom, his gifts diminished in lavishness and frequency. She and her
husband had little in common besides their household worries and the children,
so that their quarrels stood out as important events; it was mainly on these
occasions that they had anything but the most casual conversations. At any
rate, her married life had proved one thing to her that she had always
maintained: that ail men were mean and tyrannical. As it turned out, this
attitude was related to some daydreams of being sexually abused which had
plagued her in earlier years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are various ways of describing this game in general
terms. It is apparent that it belongs in the large field of social dynamics.
The basic fact is that by marrying, Mr. and Mrs. White have an opportunity to
communicate with each other, and such an opportunity may be called social
contact. The fact that they use this opportunity makes their household a social
aggregation, as contrasted with a New York subway train, for example, where
people are in spatial contact but rarely avail themselves of the opportunity
and so form a dis-social aggregation. The influence the Whites exert on each
other’s behavior and responses constitutes social action. Various disciplines
would investigate such social action from different points of view. Since we
are here concerned with the personal histories and psycho-dynamics of the
individuals involved, the present approach is one aspect of social—psychiatry;
some implicit or explicit judgment is passed on the “healthiness” of the games
studied. This is somewhat different from the more neutral and less committed
attitudes of sociology and social psychology. Psychiatry reserves the right to
say, “Just a moment!” which the other disciplines do not. Tiansactional
analysis is a branch of social psychiatry, and game analysis is a special
aspect of transactional analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Practical game analysis deals with special cases as they
appear in specific situations. Theoretical game analysis attempts to abstract
and generalize the characteristics of various games, so that they can be
recognized independently of their momentary verbal content and their cultural
matrix. The theoretical analysis of “If It Weren’t For You,” Marital Type, for
example, should state the characteristics of that game in such a way that it
can be recognized just as easily in a New Guinea jungle village as in a
Manhattan penthouse, whether it is concerned with a nuptial party or with the
financial problems of getting a fishing rod for the grandchildren; and
regardless of how bluntly or subtly the moves are made, according to the
permissible degrees of frankness between husband and wife. The prevalence of
the game in a given society is a matter for sociology and anthropology. Game
analysis, as a part of social psychiatry, is only interested in describing the
game when it does occur, regardless of how often that may be. This distinc-tion
is not complex, but it is analogous to the distinction between public health
and internal medicine; the first is interested in the prevalence of malaria,
while the latter studies cases of malaria as they come up, in the jungle or in
Manhattan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the present time the scheme given below has been round
the most useful one for theoretical game analysis. No doubt it will be improved
as further knowledge accumulates. The first requisite is to recognize that a
certain sequence of maneuvers meets the criteria of a game. As many samples as
possible of the game are then collected. The significant features of the collection
are isolated. Certain aspects emerge as essential. These are then classified
under headings which are designed to be as meaningful and instructive as
possible in the current state of knowledge. The analysis is undertaken from the
point of view of the one who is “it”—in this case, Mrs. White.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is a genera) description of the game, including
the immediate sequence of events (the social level) and information about their
psychological background, evolution and significance (the psychological level).
In the case of “If It Weren’t For You,” Marital Type, the details already  
given   will   serve   (pp.   50-51).   For   the   sake   of brevity, this
game will henceforth be referred to as IWFY.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The presumption that a certain sequence
constitutes a game is tentative until it has been existentially validated. This
validation is carried out by a refusal to plav or by undercutting the payoff.
The one who is “it” will then make more intense efforts to continue the game.
In the face of adamant refusal to play or a successful undercutting he will
then lapse into a state called “despair,” which in some respects resembles a
depression, but is different in significant ways. It is more acute and contains
elements of frustration and bewilderment. It may be manifested, for example, by
the onset of perplexed weeping. In a successful therapeutic situation this may
soon be replaced by humorous laughter, implying an Adult realization: “There I
go again!” Thus despair is a concern of the Adult, while in depression it is
the Child who has the executive power. Hopefulness, enthusiasm or a lively
interest in one’s surroundings is the opposite of depression; laughter is the
opposite of despair. Hence the enjoyable quality of therapeutic game analysis.
The antithesis to IWFY is permissiveness. As long as the husband is
prohibitive, the game can proceed. If instead of saying “Don’t you dare!” he
says “Go ahead!” the underlying phobias are unmasked, and the wife can no
longer turn on him, as demonstrated in Mrs. White’s case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For clear understanding of a game, the antithesis should be
known and its effectiveness demonstrated in practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aim, This states simply the general purpose of the game.
Sometimes there are alternatives. The aim of IWFY may be stated as either
reassurance (“It’s not that I’m afraid, it’s that he won’t let me”) or
vindication (“It’s not that I’m not trying, it’s that he holds me back”). The
reassuring function is easier to clarify and is more in accord with the
security needs of the wife; therefore IWFY is most simply regarded as having
the aim of reassurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roles. As previously noted, ego states are not roles but phenomena.
Therefore ego states and roles have to be distinguished in a formal
description. Games may be described as two-handed, three-handed, many-handed,
etc., according to the number of roles offered. Sometimes the ego state of each
player corresponds to his role, sometimes it does not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IWFY is a two-handed game and calls For a restricted wife
and a domineering husband. The wife may play her role either as a prudent Adult
(“It’s best that I do as he says”) or as a petulant Child. The domineering
husband may preserve an Adult ego state (“It’s best that you do as I say”) or
slip into a Parental one (“You’d better do what I say”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dynamics. There are alternatives in staring the psycho-dynamic
driving forces behind each case of a game. It is usually possible, however, to
pick out a single psychody-namic concept which usefully, aptly and meaningfully
epitomizes the situation. Thus IWFY is best described as deriving from phobic
sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examples. Since the childhood origins of a game, or its infantile
prototypes, are instructive to study, it is worthwhile to search for such
cognates in making a formal description. It happens that IFWY is just as
frequently played by little children as by grown-ups, so the childhood version
is the same as the later one, with the actual parent substituted for the
restricting husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Transactional Paradigm. The rransactional analysis of a
typical situation is presented, giving both tbe social and psychological levels
of a revealing ulterior transaction. In its most dramatic form, IWFY at the
social level is a Parent-Child game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. White: “You stay home and take care of tbe house.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mrs. White: “It it weren’t for you, I could be out having
fun.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At tbe psychological level (the ulterior marriage contract)
the relationship is Child-Child, and quite different Mr. White: “You must
always be here when I get home. I’m terrified of desertion.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mrs.   White:   “I  will  be  if you  help  me avoid phobic situations.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two levels are illustrated in Figure 7.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stay home”        “If ft weren’t for you” (“I’m terrified”)      (“Protect
me’*)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If It Weren’t For You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Game &lt; FIGURE 7  &gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moves. The moves of a game correspond roughly to the strokes
in a ritual. As in any game, tbe players become increasingly adept with
practice. Wasteful moves are eliminated, and more and more purpose is condensed
into each move. “Beautiful friendships” are often based on the fact that the
players complement each other with great economy and satisfaction, so that
there is a maximum yield with a minimum effort from the games they play with
each other. Certain intermediate, precautionary or concessional moves can be
elided, giving a high degree of elegance to the relationship. The effort saved
on defensive maneuvers can be devoted to ornamental flourishes instead, to the
delight of both parries and sometimes of the onlookers as well. The student
observes that there is a minimum number of moves essential to the program of
the game, and these can be stated in the protocol. Individual players will embellish
or multiply these basic moves according to their needs, talents or desires. The
framework for IWFY is as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(1) Instruction-Compliance (“You stay home”—”All right”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(2) Instruction-Protest (“You stay home again”—”If it weren’t
for you”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advantages. The general advantages of a game consist in its
stabilizing (homeostatic) functions. Biological homeo-stasis is promoted by the
stroking, and psychological stability is reinforced by the confirmation of
position. As has already been noted, stroking may take various forms, so that
the biological advantage of a game may be stated in tactile terms. Thus the
husband’s role in IWFY is reminiscent of a backhanded slap (quite different in
effect from a palmar slap, which is a direct humiliation), and the wife’s
response is something like a petulant kick in the shins. Hence the biological
gain from IWFY is derived from the belligerence-petulance exchanges: a
distressing but apparently effective way to maintain the health of nervous
tissues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Confirmation of the wife’s position—”All men are tyrants”—is
the existential advantage. This position is a reaction to the need to surrender
that is inherent in the phobias, a demonstration of the coherent structure which
underlies all games. The expanded statement would be: “If I went out alone in a
crowd, I would be overcome by the temptation to surrender; at home I don’t
surrender: he forces me, which proves that all men are tyrants.” Hence this
game is commonly played by women who suffer from feelings of unreality, which
signifies their difficulty in keeping the Adult in charge in situations of
strong temptation. The detailed elucidation of these mechanisms belongs to
psychoanalysis rather than game analysis. In game analysis the end product is
the chief concern.///Internal •psychological advantage of a game is its direct
effect on the psychic economy (libido). In IWFY the socially acceptable
surrender to the husband’s authority keeps the woman from experiencing neurotic
fears. At the same time it satisfies masochistic needs, if they exist, using
masochism not in the sense of self-abnegation but with its classical meaning of
sexual excitement in situations of deprivation, humiliation or pain. That is,
it excites her to be deprived and dominated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>External psychological advantage is the avoidance of the
feared situation by playing the game. This is especially obvious in IWFY, where
it is the outstanding motivation: by complying with the husband’s strictures,
the wife avoids the public situations which she fears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Internal social advantage is designed by the name of the
game as it is played in the individual’s intimate circle. By her compliance,
the wife gains the privilege of saying “If it weren’t for you.” This helps to
structure the time she must spend with her husband; in the case of Mrs. White,
this need for structure was especially strong because of the lack of other
common interests, especially before the arrival of their offspring and after
the children were grown. In between, the game was played less intensively and
less frequently, because the children performed their usual function of
structuring time for their parents, and also provided an even more widely
accepted version of IWFY, the busy-housewife variation. The fact that young mothers
in America often really are very busy does not change the analysis of this
variation. Game analysis only attempts to answer this question without
prejudice: given that a young woman is busy, how does she go about exploiting
her busyness in order to get some compensation for it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>External social advantage is designated by tbe use made of
the situation in outside social contacts. In the case of the game “If It Weren’t
For You,” which is what the wife says to her husband, there is a transformation
into the pastime “If It Weren’t For Him” when she meets with her friends over
morning coffee. Again, the influence of games in the selection of social
companions is shown. The new neighbor who is invited for morning coffee is
being invited to play “If It Weren’t For Him.” If she plays, well and good, she
will soon be a bosom friend of the old-timers, other things being equal. If she
refuses to play and insists on taking a charitable view of her husband, she
will not last long. Her situation will be the same as if she kept refusing to
drink at cocktail parties—in most circles, she would gradually be dropped from
the guest lists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This completes the analysis of the formal features of IWFY.
In order to clarify the procedure further, the analysis of “Why Don’t You—Yes
But,” which is the most common game played at social gatherings, committee
meetings and psychotherapy groups the world over, should be consulted (page
115).</p>

<h3>3. The Genesis Of Games</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the present point of view, child rearing may be regarded
as an educational process in which the child is taught what games to play and
how to play diem. He is also taught procedures, rituals and pastimes
appropriate to his position in the local social situation, but these are less
significant. His knowledge of and skill in procedures, rituals and pastimes
determine what opportunities will be available to him, other things being
equal; but his games determine the use he will make of those opportunities, and
the outcomes of situations for which he is eligible. As elements of his script,
or unconscious life-plan, his favored games also determine his ultimate destiny
(again with other things being equal): the payoffs on his marriage and career,
and the circumstances surrounding his death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While conscientious parents devote a great deal of attention
to teaching their children procedures, rituals and pastimes appropriate to
their stations in life, and with equal care select schools, colleges and
churches where their teachings will be reinforced, they tend to overlook the
question of games, which form the basic structure for the emotional dynamics of
each family, and which the children learn through significant experiences in
everyday living from their earliest months. Related questions have been
discussed for thousands of years in a rather general, unsystematic fashion, and
there has been some attempt at a more methodical approach in the modern
orthopsychiatric literature; but without the concept of games there is little
possibility of a consistent investigation. Theories of internal individual
psy-chodynamics have so far not been able to solve satisfactorily the problems
of human relationships. These are trans-actional situations which call for a
theory of social dynamics that cannot be derived solely from consideration of
individual motivations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since there are as yet few well-trained specialists in child
psychology and child psychiatry who are also trained in game analysis,
observations on the genesis of games are sparse. Fortunately, the following
episode took place in the presence of a well-educated transactional analyst.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tanjy, age 7, got a stomach-ache at the dinner table and
asked to be excused for that reason. His parents suggested that he lie down for
a while. His little brother Mike, age 3, then said, “I have a stomach-ache too,”
evidently angling for the same consideration. The father looked at him for a
few seconds and then replied, “You don’t want to play that game, do you?”
Whereupon Mike burst out laughing and said, “No!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If this had been a household of food or bowel faddists, Mike
would also have been packed off to bed by his alarmed parents. If he and they
had repeated this performance several times, it might be anticipated that this
game would have become part of Mike’s character, as it so often does if the
parents cooperate. Whenever he was jealous of a privilege granted to a
competitor, he would plead illness in order to get some privileges himself. The
ulterior transaction would then consist of: (social level) “I don’t feel well”
+ (psychological level) “You must grant me a privilege, too.” Mike, however,
was saver from such a hypochondriacal career. Perhaps he will end up with a
worse fate, but that is not the issue. The issue is that a game in statu
nascendi was broken Xip right there by the father’s question and by the boy’s
frank acknowledgment that what he proposed was a game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This demonstrates clearly enough that games are quite deliberately
initiated by young children. After they become fixed patterns of stimulus and
response, their origins become lost in the mists of time and their ulterior
nature becomes obscured by social fogs. Both can be brought into awareness only
by appropriate procedures: the origin by some form of analytic therapy and the
ulterior aspect by antithesis. Repeated clinical experience along these lines
makes it clear that games are imitative in nature, and that they are initially
set up by the Adult (neopsychic) aspect of the child’s personality. If the
Child ego state can be revived in the grown-up player, the psychological aptitude
of this segment (the Adult aspect of the Child ego state) is so striking, and
its skill in manipulating people so enviable, that it is colloquially called “The
Professor” (of Psychiatry). Hence in psychotherapy groups which concentrate on
game analysis, one of the more sophisticated procedures is the search for the
little “Professor” in each patient, whose early adventures in setting up games
between the ages of two and eight are listened to by everyone present with
fascination and often, unless the games are tragic, with enjoyment and even
hilarity, in which the patient himself may join with justifiable
self-appreciation and smugness. Once he is able to do that, he is well on his
way to relinquishing what may be an unfortunate behavior pattern which he is
much.better off without.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those are the reasons why in the formal description of a
game an attempt is always made to describe the infantile or childhood
prototype.</p>

<h3>4. The Function Of Games</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because   there   is   so   little   opportunity   for  
intimacy  in daily life, and because some forms of intimacy (especially if intense)
are psychologically impossible for most people, the bulk of the time in serious
social life is taken up with playing games. Hence games are both necessary and
desirable, and the only problem at issue is whether the games played by an
individual offer the best yield for him. In this connection it should be
remembered that the essential feature of a game is its culmination, or payoff.
The principal function of the preliminary moves is to set up the situation for
this payoff, but they are always designed to harvest the maximum permissible
satisfaction at each step as a secondary product. Thus in “Schlemiel” (making
messes and then apologizing) the payoff, and the purpose of the game, is to
obtain the forgiveness which is forced by the apology; the spillings and
cigarette burns are only steps leading up to this, but each such trespass
yields its own pleasure. The enjoyment derived from the spilling does not make
spilling a game. The apology is the critical stimulus that leads to the
denouement. Otherwise the spilling would simply be a destructive procedure, a
delinquency perhaps enjoyable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The game of “Alcoholic” is similar: whatever the
physiological origin, if any, of the need to drink, in terms of game analysis
the imbibing is merely a move in a game which is carried on with the people in
the environment. The drinking may bring its own kinds of pleasure, but it is
not the essence of the game. This is demonstrated in the variant of “Dry Alcoholic,”
which involves the same moves and leads to the same payoff as the regular game,
but is played without any bottles (page 75).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beyond their social function in structuring time
satisfactorily, some games are urgently necessary for the maintenance of health
in certain individuals. These people’s psychic stability is so precarious, and
their positions are so tenuously maintained, that to deprive them of their
games may plunge them into irreversible despair and even psychosis. Such people
will fight very hard against any antithetical moves. This is often observed in
marital situations when the psychiatric improvement of one spouse (i-e., the
abandonment of destructive games) leads to rapid deterioration in the other
spouse, to whom the games were of paramount importance in maintaining
equilibrium. Hence it is necessary to exercise prudence in game analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately, the rewards of game-free intimacy, which is or
should be the most perfect form of human living, are so great that even
precariously balanced personalities can safely and joyfully relinquish their
games if an appropriate partner can be found for the better relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On a larger scale, games are integral and dynamic components
of the unconscious life-plan, or script, of each individual; they serve to fill
in the time while he waits for the final fulfillment, simultaneously advancing
the action. Since the last act of a script characteristically calls for either
a miracle or a catastrophe, depending on whether the script is constructive or
destructive, the corresponding games ate accordingly either constructive or destructive.
In colloquial terms, an individual whose script is oriented toward “waiting for
Santa Claus” is likely to be pleasant to deal with in such games as “Gee You’re
Wonderful, Mr. Murgatroyd,” while someone with a tragic script oriented toward “waiting
for rigor mortis to set in” may play such disagreeable games as “Now I’ve Got
You, You Son of a Bitch.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It should be noted that colloquialisms such as those in the
previous sentence are an integral part of game analysis, and are freely used in
transactional psychotherapy groups and seminars. The expression “waiting for
rigor mortis to set in” originated in a dream of a patient, in which she
decided to get certain things done “before rigor mortis set in.” A patient in a
sophisticated group pointed out what the therapist had overlooked: that in
practice, waiting for Santa Claus and waiting for death are synonymous. Since
colloquialisms are of decisive importance in game analysis, they will be
discussed at length later on.</p>

<h3>5. The Classification Of Games </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of the variables used in analyzing games and pastimes
have already been mentioned, and any of them can be used in classifying games
and pastimes systematically. Some of the more obvious classifications are based
on the following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Number of players: two-handed games (Frigid Woman),
three-handed games (Let’s You and Him Fight), five-handed games (Alcoholic) and
many-handed games (Why Don’t You-Yes But).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Currency used: words (Psychiatry), money (Debtor), parts
of the body (Polysurgery).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Clinical types: hysterical (Rapo), obsessive-compulsive
(Schlemiel), paranoid (Why Does This Have to Happen to Me), depressive (There I
Go Again).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. Zonal: oral (Alcoholic), anal (Schlemiel), phallic (Let’s
You and Him Fight).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. Psychodynamic: counterphobic (If It Weren’t for You), projective
(PTA), introjective (Psychiatry).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6. Instinctual: masochistic (If It Weren’t for You),
sadistic (Schlemiel), fetishistic (Frigid Man).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to the number of players, three other
quantitative variables are often useful to consider:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Flexibility. Some games, such as Debtor and Poly-surgery,
can be played properly with only one kind of currency, while others, such as
exhibit!onistic games, are more flexible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Tenacity. Some people give up their games easily, others
are persistent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Intensity. Some people play their games in a relaxed way,
others are more tense and aggressive. Games so played are known as easy and
hard games, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These three variables converge to make games gentle or violent.
In mentally disturbed people, there is often a noticeable progression in this
respect, so that one can speak of stages. A paranoid schizophrenic may
initially play a flexible, loose, easy game of first-stage “Ain’t It Awful” and
progress to an inflexible, tenacious, hard third stage. The stages in a game
are distinguished as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a. A First-Degree Game is one which is socially acceptable
in the agent’s circle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b. A Second-Degree Game is one from which no permanent, irremediable
damage arises, but which the players would rather conceal from the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>c. A Third-Degree Game is one which is played for keeps, and
which ends in the surgery, the courtroom or the morgue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Games can also be classified according to any of the other
specific factors discussed in the analysis of IWFY: the aims, the roles, the
most obvious advantages. The most likely candidate For a systematic, scientific
classification is probably one based on the existential position; but since
knowledge of this factor is not yet sufficiently advanced, such a
classification will have to be postponed. Failing that, the most practical
classification at present is probably a sociological one. That is what will be
used in the next section.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due credit should be given to Stephen Potter for his
perceptive, humorous discussions of maneuvers, or “ploys,” in everyday social
situations^ and to G. H. Mead for his pioneering study of the role of games in
social living.3 Those games that lead to psychiatric disabilities have been
systematically studied at the San Francisco Social Psychiatry Seminars since
1958, and this sector of game analysis has recently been approached by T.
Szasz.4 For the role of games in the group process, die present writer’s book
on group dynamics should be consulted.*</p>

<h1>Part II: A Thesaurus of Games</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>THIS collection is complete to date O962), but new games are
continually being discovered. Sometimes what appears to be another example of a
known game turns out, on more careful study, to be an entirely new one, and a
game which appears to be new often turns out to be a variation of a known one.
The individual items of the analyses are also subject to change as new
knowledge accumulates; for example, where there are several possible choices in
describing dynamics, the statement given may turn out later not to have been
the most cogent one. Both the list of games and the items given in the
analyses, however, are adequate for clinical work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the games are discussed and analyzed in ex-tenso.
Others, which require more investigation, or are uncommon, or whose
significance is fairly obvious, are only briefly mentioned. The one who is “it”
is generally referred to as the “agent,” or is given the name of “White,” while
the other party is called “Black.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The games are classified into families according to the situations
in which they most commonly occur: Life Games, Marital Games, Party Games,
Sexual Games and Underworld Games; then comes a section for professionals on
Consulting Room Games, and finally, some examples of Good Games.</p>

<h3>1. Notation</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following notation will be used in the analytic
protocols.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Title: If the game has a long name, a convenient
abbreviation is used in the text. Where a game or its variations has more than
one name, a cross reference will be found in the Index of Games. In oral
reports it is preferable to use the full name of the game rather than its
abbreviation or acronym.///Thesis: this is restated as cogently as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aim: this gives the most meaningful choice, based on die
writer’s experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roles: the role of the one who is “it,” and from whose point
of view the game is discussed, is given first, in italics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dynamics: as with aim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examples: (1) this gives an illustration of the game as
played in childhood, the most easily recognizable pertinent prototype. (2) an
illustration from adult life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paradigm: this illustrates as briefly as possible the
critical transaction or transactions at the social and psychological levels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moves: this gives the minimum number of transactional stimuli
and transactional responses as found in practice. These may be expanded,
diluted or ornamented to an unlimited extent in different situations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—this attempts to
state how the game contributes to internal psychic stability. (2) External
Psychological—this attempts to state what anxiety-arousing situations or
intimacies are being avoided. (3) Internal Social—this gives the characteristic
phrase used in the game as played with intimates. (4) External Social—this
gives the key phrase used in the derivative game or pastime played in less
intimate circles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(5) Biological—this attempts to characterize the kind of
stroking which the game offers to the parties involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(6) Existential—this states the position from which the game
is typically played.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relatives: this gives the names of complementary, allied and
antithetical games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An adequate understanding of a game can only be obtained in
the psychotherapeutic situation. People who play destructive games will come to
the therapist far more frequently than people who play constructive ones.
Therefore most of the games which are well understood are basically
destructive, but the reader should remember that there are constructive ones
played by more fortunate people.///And to prevent the idea of games from
becoming vulgarized, as so many psychiatric terms are, it should be emphasized
once more that it is a very precise idea: games should be clearly
distinguished, by the criteria given previously, from procedures, rituals,
pastimes, operations, maneuvers and the attitudes which arise from various
positions. A game is played from a position, but a position or its
corresponding attitude is not a game.</p>

<h3>2. Colloquialisms</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many colloquialisms used here were supplied by patients. All
of them, if used with due regard to timing and sensibilities, are appreciated,
understood and enjoyed by the players. If some of them seem disrespectful, the
irony is directed against the games and not against the people who play them.
The first requirement for colloquialisms is aptness, and if they often sound
amusing, that is precisely because they hit the nail on the head. As I have
tried to show elsewhere in discussing colloquial epithets, a whole page of
learned polysyllables may not convey as much as the statement that a certain
woman is a bitch, or that a certain man is a jerk.1 Psychological truths may be
stated for academic purposes in scientific language, but the effective
recognition of emotional strivings in practice may require a different
approach. So we prefer playing “Ain’t It Awful” to “verbalizing projected anal
aggression.” The former not only has a more dynamic meaning and impact, but it
is actually more precise. And sometimes people get better faster in bright
rooms than diey do in drab ones.</p>

<h2>Chapter Six. Life Games</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>ALL games have an important and probably decisive influence
on the destinies of the players under ordinary social conditions; but some
offer more opportunities than others for lifelong careers and are more likely
to involve relatively innocent bystanders. This group may bt conveniently
called Life Games. It includes “Alcoholic,” “Debtor,” “Kick Me,” “Now I’ve Got
You, You Son of a Bitch,” “See What You Made Me Do” and their principal
varjants. They merge on the one side with marital games, a^J On the other with
those of the underworld.</p>

<h3>1. Alcoholic</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. In game analysis there is n() sucn thing as
alcoholism or “an alcoholic,” but there is a role called the Alcoholic in a certain
type of game. If a biochemical or physiological abnormality is the prim^ mover
in excessive drinking-and that is still open to some question-then its study
belongs in the field of intei-nal medicine. Game analysis is interested in
something quit(&gt; different—the kinds of social transactions that are related
to such excesses. Hence the game “Alcoholic.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In its full flower this is a five-handecl game, although the
roles may be condensed so that it starts off and terminates as a two-handed
one. The central role |s that of the Alcoholic—the one who is “it”—played by
White. The chief supporting role is that of Persecutor, typically played by a
member of the opposite sex, usually the spouse. The third role is that of
Rescuer, usually played by someone of the same sex, often the good family
doctor who is interested in the patient and also in drinkin&lt;, problems. In
the classical situation the doctor successfully rescues the alcoholic from his
habit. After White has not taken a drink for six months they congratulate each
other. The following day White is found in the gutter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fourth role is that of the Patsy, or Dummy. In
literature this is played by the delicatessen man who extends credit to White,
gives him a sandwich on the curt and perhaps a cup of coffee, without either
persecuting him or trying to rescue him. In life this is more frequently played
by White’s mother, who gives him money and often sympathizes with him about the
wife who does not understand him. In this aspect of the game, White is required
to account in some plausible way for his need for money—by some project in
which both pretend to believe, although they know what he is really going to
spend most of the money for. Sometimes the Patsy slides over into another role,
which is a helpful but not essential one: the Agitator, the “good guy” who
offers supplies without even being asked for them: “Come have a drink with me
(and you will go downhill faster).”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ancillary professional in all drinking games is the bartender
or liquor clerk. In the game “Alcoholic” he plays the fifth role, the
Connection, the direct source of supply who also understands alcoholic talk,
and who in a way is the most meaningful person in the life of any addict. The
difference between the Connection and the other players is the difference
between professionals and amateurs in any game: the professional knows when to
stop. At a certain point a good bartender refuses to serve the Alcoholic, who
is then left without any supplies unless he can locate a more indulgent
Connection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the initial stages of “Alcoholic,” the wife may play all
three supporting roles: at midnight the Patsy, undressing him, making him
coffee and letting him beat up on her; in the morning the Persecutor, berating
him for the evil of his ways; and in the evening the Rescuer, pleading with him
to change them. In the later stages, due sometimes to organic deterioration,
the Persecutor and the Rescuer can be dispensed with, but are tolerated if they
are also wilting to act as sources of supply. White will go to the Mission
House and be rescued if he can get a free meal there; or be will stand for a
scolding, amateur or professional, as long as he can get a handout afterward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Present experience indicates that the payoff in “Alcoholic”
(as is characteristic of games in general) comes from the aspect to which most
investigators pay least attention. In the analysis of this game, drinking
itself is merely an incidental pleasure having added advantages, the procedure
leading up to the ;«*•&gt;‘ culmination, which is the hangover. It is the same
in tV. ^me of Schlemiel: the mess-making, which attracts the rhost attention,
is merely a pleasure-giving way for White to lead up to the crux, which is
obtaining forgiveness from Black.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the Alcoholic the hangover is not as much the physical
pain as the psychological torment. The two favorite pastimes of drinking people
are “Martini” (how many drinks and how they were mixed) and “Morning After”
(Let me tell you about my hangover). “Martini” is played, for the most part, by
social drinkers; many alcoholics prefer a hard round of psychological “Morning
After,” and organizations such as A.A. offer him an unlimited opportunity for
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever one patient visited his psychiatrist after a binge,
he would call himself all sorts of names; the psychiatrist said nothing. Later,
recounting these visits in a therapy group, White said with smug satisfaction
that it was the psychiatrist who had called him all those names. The main conversational
interest of many alcoholics in the therapeutic situation is not their drinking,
which they apparently mention mostly in deference to their persecutors, but
their subsequent suffering. The transactions! object of the drinking, aside
from the personal pleasures it brings, is to set up a situation where the Child
can be severely scolded not only by the internal Parent but by any parental
figures in the environment who are interested enough to oblige. Hence the
therapy of this game should be concentrated not on the drinking but on the
morning after, the self-indulgence in self-castigation. There is a type of
heavy drinker, however, who does not have hangovers, and such people do not
belong in the present category.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is also a game “Dry Alcoholic,” in which White goes
through the process of financial or social degradation without a bottle, making
the same sequence of moves and requiring the same supporting cast. Here again,
the morning after is the crux of the matter. Indeed, it is the similarity between
“Dry Alcoholic” and regular “Alcoholic” which emphasizes that both are games;
for example, the procedure for getting discharged from a job is the same in
both. “Addict” is similar to “Alcoholic,” but more sinister, more dramatic,
more sensational and faster. In our society, at least, it leans more heavily on
the readily available Persecutor, with Patsies and Rescuers being few and far
between and the Connection playing a much more central role.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a variety of organizations involved in “Alcoholic,”
some of them national or even international in scope, others local. Many of
them publish rules for the game. Nearly all of them explain how to play the
role of Alcoholic: take a drink before breakfast, spend money allotted for
other purposes, etc. They also explain the function of the Rescuer. Alcoholics
Anonymous, for example, continues playing the actual game but concentrates on inducing
the Alcoholic to take the role of Rescuer. Former Alcoholics are preferred
because they know how the game goes, and hence are better qualified to play the
supporting role than people who have never played before. Cases have been
reported of a chapter of A.A. running out of Alcoholics to work on; whereupon
the members resumed drinking since there was no other way to continue the game
in the absence of people to rescue.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are also organizations devoted  to improving the lot
of the other players. Some put pressure on the spouses to shift their roles
from Persecutor to Rescuer. The one which seems to come closest to the theoretical
ideal of treatment deals with teen-age offspring of alcoholics; these youna
people are encouraged to break away from the game itself, rather than merely
shift their roles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psychological cure of an alcoholic also lies in getting
him to stop playing the game altogether, rather than simply change from one
role to another. In some cases this has been feasible, although it is a
difficult task to find something else as interesting to the Alcoholic as
continuing his oame. Since he is classically afraid of intimacy, the substitute
may have to be another game rather than a game-free relationship. Often
so-called cured alcoholics are not very stimulating company socially, and
possibly they feel a lack of excitement in their lives and are continually tempted
to go back to their old ways. The criterion of a true “game cure” is that the
former Alcoholic should be able to drink socially without putting himself in
jeopardy. The usual “total abstinence” cure will not satisfy the game analyst.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tt is apparent from the description of this game that there
is a strong temptation for the Rescuer to play “I’m Only Trvin» to Help You”:
for the Persecutor to play “Look What You’ve Done to Me”; and for the Patsy* to
play “Good Joe.” With the rise of rescue organizations which publicize the idea
that alcoholism is a disease, alcoholics have been taught to play “Wooden Leg.”
The law, which takes a special interest in such people, tends to encourage this
nowadays—The emphasis has shifted from the Persecutor to the Rescuer, from “I
am a sinner” to “What do you expect from a sick mane1” (part of the trend in
modern thinking away from religion and toward science). From an existential
point of view the shift is questionable, and from a practical point of view it
seems to have done little to diminish the sale of liquor to heavy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*In the underworld slang “patsy” once meant all right, or
satisfactory, and later came to denote a “pigeon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>drinkers. Nevertheless, Alcoholics Anonymous is still for
most people the best initiation into the therapy of over-indulgence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. As is well known, “Alcoholic” is usually played
hard and is difficult to give up. In one case a female alcoholic in a therapy
group participated very little until she thought she knew enough about the
other members to go ahead with her game. She then asked them to tell her what
they thought of her. Since she had behaved pleasantly enough, various members
said nice things about her, but she protested: “That’s not what I want. I want
to know what you really think.” She made it clear that she was seeking
derogatory comments. The other women refused to persecute her, whereupon she
went home and told her husband that if she took another drink, he must either
divorce her or send her to a hospital. He promised to do this, and that evening
she became intoxicated and he sent her to a sanitarium. Here the other members
refused to play the persecutory roles White assigned to them; she was unable to
tolerate this antithetical behavior, in spite of everyone’s efforts to
reinforce whatever insight she had already obtained. At home she found someone
who was willing to play the role she demanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In other cases, however, it appears possible to prepare the
patient sufficiently so that the game can be given up, and to attempt a true
social cure in which the therapist declines to play either Persecutor or
Rescuer. It is equally untherapeutic for him to play the role of Patsy by
allowing the patient to forego his financial and punctuality obligations. The
correct therapeutic procedure from a transactional point of view is, after
careful preliminary groundwork, to take an Adult contractual position and
refuse to play any of the roles, hoping that the patient will be able to
tolerate not only abstinence from drinking but also from playing his game. If
he cannot, he is best referred to a Rescuer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis is particularly difficult, because the heavy
drinker is highly regarded in most Western countries as a desirable object for
censure, concern or generosity, and someone who refuses to play any of these
roles tends to arouse public indignation. A rational approach may be even more
alarming to the Rescuers than to the Alcoholic, sometimes with unfortunate
consequences to the therapy. In one clinical situation a group of workers were
seriously interested in the game “Alcoholic” and were attempting to effect real
cures by breaking up the game rather than merely rescuing the patients. As soon
as this became apparent, they were frozen out by the lay committee which was
backing the clinic, and none of them was ever again called on to assist in
treating these patients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relatives. An interesting byplay in “Alcoholic” is called “Have
One.” This was discovered by a perceptive student of industrial psychiatry.
White and his wife (a non-drinking Persecutor) go on a picnic with Black and
his wife (both Patsies). White says to the Blacks, “Have one!” If they have
one, this gives White license to have four or five. The game is unmasked if the
Blacks refuse. White, by the rules of drinking, is then entitled to be
insulted, and he will find more compliant companions for his next picnic. What
appears at the social level to be Adult generosity, is at the psychological
level an act of insolence, whereby White’s Child obtains Parental indulgence
from Black by open bribery under the very nose of Mrs. White, who is powerless
to protest. Actually it is just because she will be “powerless” to protest dial
Mrs. White consents to the whole arrangement, since she is just as anxious for
the game to continue, with herself in the role of Persecutor, as Mr. White is
with himself in the role of Alcoholic, Her recriminations against him in the
morning after die picnic are easy to imagine. This variant can cause
complications if White is Black’s boss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In general the Patsy is not as badly off as the name
implies. Patsies are often lonely people who have a great deal to gain by being
nice to Alcoholics. The delicatessen man who plays “Good Joe” makes many
acquaintances in this way, and he can get a good reputation in his own social
circle not only as a generous person but also as a good storyteller.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One variant of “Good Joe,” incidentally, is to go around
asking for advice about how best to help people. This is an example of a jolly
and constructive game worth encouraging. Its inverse is Tough Guy, taking
lessons in violence or asking for advice about how best to hurt people.
Although the mayhem is never put into practice, the player has the privilege of
associating with real tough guys who are playing for keeps, and can bask in
their reflected glory. This is one species of what the French call un fanfaron
de vice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.    ANALYSIS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis: How bad I’ve been; see if you can stop me. Aim: 
Self-castigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roles: Alcoholic, Persecutor, Rescuer, Patsy, Connection. Dynamics:
Oral deprivation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examples: (1) See if you can catch me. The prototypes of
this game are difficult to correlate because of its complexity. Children,
however, particularly children of alcoholics, often go through many of the
maneuvers characteristic of the Alcoholic. “See if you can stop me,” which
involves lying, hiding things, seeking derogatory comments, looking for helpful
people, finding a benevolent neighbor who will give free handouts, etc.
Self-castigation is often postponed to later years. (2) The alcoholic and his
circle, Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult: “Tell me what you really think of me or help me stop
drinking.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult:   “I’ll be frank with you.” Psychological Paradigm:
Parent-Child. Child:  “See if you can stop me.” Parent:  “You must stop
drinking because ....” Moves:  CO Provocation—accusation or forgiveness.   (2)
Indulgence—anger or disappointment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—(a) Drinking as a procedure—rebellion,
reassurance and satisfaction of craving. (tO “Alcoholic” as a
game—self-castigation (probable). (2) External Psychological—avoidance of
sexual and other forms of intimacy. (3) Internal Social—See if you can stop me.
(4) External Social—”Morning After,” “Martini,” and other pastimes. (5)
Biological—alternating loving and angry exchanges. (6) Existential—Everybody
wants to deprive me,</p>

<h3>2. Debtor</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. “Debtor” is more than a game. In America it tends to
become a script, a plan for a whole lifetime, just as it does in some of the
jungles of Africa and New Guinea.2 There the relatives of a young man buy him a
bride at an enormous price, putting him in their debt for years to come. Here
die same custom prevails, at least in the more civilized sections of the country,
except that the bride price becomes a house price, and if there is no stake from
the relatives, this role is taken on by the bank. Thus the young man in New
Guinea with an old wrist watch dangling from his ear to ensure success, and the
young man in America with a new wrist watch wrapped around his arm to ensure
success, both feel that they have a “purpose” in life. The big celebration, the
wedding or housewarming, takes place not when the debt is discharged, but when
it is undertaken. What is emphasized on TV, for example, is not the middle-aged
man who has finally paid off his mortgage, but the young man who moves into his
new home with his family, proudly waving the papers he has just signed and
which will bind him for most of his productive years. After he has paid his
debts—the mortgage, the college expenses for his children and his insurance—he
is regarded as a problem, a “senior citizen” for whom society must provide not
only material comforts but a new “purpose.” As in New Guinea, if he is very
shrewd, he may become a big creditor instead of a big debtor, but this happens
relatively rarely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As this is written, a sow bug crawls across a desk. If he is
turned over on his back, one can observe the tremendous struggle he goes
through to get on his feet again. During this interval he has a “purpose” in
his life. When he succeeds, one can almost see the look of victory on his face.
Off he goes, and one can imagine him telling his tale at the next meeting of
sow bugs, looked up to by the younger generation as an insect who has made it.
And yet mixed with his smugness is a little disappointment. Now that he has
come out on top, life seems aimless. Maybe he will return in the hope of
repeating his triumph. It might be worth marking his back with ink, so as to
recognize him if he risks it. A courageous animal, the sow bug. No wonder he has
survived for millions of years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most young Americans, however, take their mortgages very seriously
only in times of stress. If they are depressed, or the economic situation is
bad, their obligations keep them going—and may prevent some of them from committing
suicide. Most of the time they play a mild game of “If It Weren’t for the
Debts,” but otherwise enjoy themselves. Only a few make a career out of playing
a hard game of “Debtor,”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Try and Collect” (TAG) is commonly played by young married
couples, and illustrates how a game is set up so that the player “wins”
whichever way it goes. The Whites obtain all sorts of goods and services on
credit, petty or luxurious, depending on their backgrounds and how they were
taught to play by their parents or grandparents. If the creditor gives up after
a few soft efforts to collect, then the Whites can enjoy their gains without
penalty, and in this sense they win. If the creditor makes more strenuous
attempts, then they enjoy the pleasures of the chase as well as the use of
their purchases. The hard form of the game occurs if the creditor is determined
to collect. In order to get his money he will have to resort to extreme
measures. These usually have a coercive element—going to White’s employers or
driving up to his house in a noisy, garish truck labeled in big letters
COLLECTION AGENCY.///At this point there is a switch. White now knows that he
will probably have to pay. But because of the coercive element, made clear in
most cases by the “third letter” from the collector (“If you do not appear at
our office within 48 hours ....”), White feels peremptorily justified in
getting angry; he now switches over to a variant of “Now I’ve Got You, You Son
of a Bitch.” In this case he wins by demonstrating that the creditor is greedy,
ruthless and untrustworthy. The two most obvious advantages of this are (1) it
strengthens White’s existential position, which is a disguised form of “All
creditors are grasping,” and (2) it offers a large external social gain, since
he is now in a position to abuse the creditor openly to his friends without
losing his own status as a “Good Joe.” He may also exploit further internal
social gain by confronting the creditor himself. In addition, it vindicates his
taking advantage of the credit system: if that is the way creditors are, as he
has now shown, why pay anybody?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Creditor,” in the form “Try and Get Away With It” (TAGAWI),
is sometimes played by small landlords. TAG and TAGAWI players readily
recognize each other, and because of the prospective transactional advantages
and the promised sport, they are secretly pleased and readily become involved
with each other. Regardless of who wins the money, each has improved the other’s
position for playing “Why Does This Always Happen To Me?” after it is all over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Money games can have very serious consequences. If these descriptions
sound facetious, as they do to some people, it is not because they relate to
trivia but because of the exposure of trivial motivations behind matters people
are taught to take seriously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The obvious antithesis of TAG is to request immediate
payment in cash. But a good TAG player has methods for getting around that,
which will work on any but the most hard-boiled creditors. The antithesis of
TAGAWI is promptness and honesty. Since hard TAG///and TAGAWI players are both
professionals in every sense of die word, an amateur stands as much chance
playing against them as he does playing against professional gamblers. While
the amateur seldom wins, he can at least enjoy himself if he becomes involved
in one of these games. Since both are by tradition played grimly, nothing is
more disconcerting to the professionals than to have an amateur victim laugh at
the outcome. In financial circles this is considered strictly Out. In the cases
reported to this writer, laughing at a debtor when one encounters him on the
street is just as bewildering, frustrating and disconcerting to him as playing
anti-”SchIemiel” is to a Schlemiel.</p>

<h3>3. Kick Me</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is played by men whose social manner is equivalent
to wearing a sign that reads “Please Don’t Kick Me.” The temptation is almost
irresistible, and when the natural result follows, White cries piteously, “But
the sign says ‘don’t kick me.’” Then he adds incredulously, “Why does this
always happen to me?” (WAHM.) Clinically, the WAHM may be introjected and
disguised in the “Psychiatry” cliche”: “Whenever I’m under stress, I get all
shook up.” One game element in WAHM comes from inverse pride: “My misfortunes
are better than yours.” This factor is often found in paranoids.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the people in his environment are restrained from
striking at him by kindheartedness, “I’m Only Trying to Help You,” social
convention or organizational rules, his behavior becomes more and more
provocative until he transgresses the limits and forces them to oblige. These
are men who are cast out, the jilted and the job losers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The corresponding game among women is “Threadbare.1 Often
genteel, they take pains to be shabby. They see to it that their earnings, for “good”
reasons, never rise much above the subsistence level. If they have a windfall,
there are always enterprising young men who will help them get rid of it,
giving them in return shares in a worthless business promotion or something
equivalent. Colloquially, such a woman is called “Mother’s Friend,” always
ready to give judicious Parental advice and living vicariously on the
experience of others. Their WAHM is a silent one, and only (heir demeanor of
brave struggle suggests “Why does this always happen to me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An interesting form of WAHM occurs in well-adapted people
who reap increasing rewards and successes, often beyond their own expectations.
Here the WAHM may lead to serious and construcrive thinking, and to personal
growth in the best sense, if it takes the form “What did I really do to deserve
this?”</p>

<h3>4. Now I’ve Got You, You Son Of A Bitch</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This can be seen in classic form in poker games.
White gets an unbeatable hand, such as four aces. At this point, if he is a
NIGYSOB player, he is more interested in the fact that Black is completely at
his mercy than he is in good poker or making monev—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White needed some plumbing fixtures installed, and he reviewed
the costs very carefully with the plumber before giving him a go-ahead. The
price was set, and it was agreed that there would be no extras. When the
plumber submitted his bill, he included a few dollars extra foi an unexpected
valve that had to be installed—about four dollars on a four-hundred-dollar job.
White became infuriated, called the plumber on the phone and demanded an explanation.
The plumber would not back down. White wrote him a long letter criticizing his
integrity and ethics and refused to pay the bill until the extra charge was
withdrawn. The plumber finally gave in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It soon became obvious that both White and the plumber were
playing games. In the course of their negotiations, they bad recognized each
other’s potentials. The plumber made his provocative move when he submitted bis
bill. Since White had the plumber’s word, the plumber was clearly in the wrong.
White now felt justified in venting almost unlimited rage against Him. Instead
of merely negotiating in a dignified way that befit the Adult standards he set
for himself, perhaps with a little innocent annoyance, White took the
opportunity to make extensive criticisms of the plumber’s whole way of living.
On the surface their argument was Adult to Adult, a legitimate business dispute
over a stated sum of money. At the psychological level it was Parent to Adult:
White was exploiting his trivial but socially defensible objection (position)
to vent the pent-up furies of many years on his cozening opponent, just as his
mother might have done in a similar situation. He quickly recognized his
underlying attitude (NIGYSOB) and realized how secretly delighted he had been
at the plumber’s provocation. He then recalled that ever since early childhood
he had looked for similar injustices, received diem with delight and exploited
them with the same vigor. In many of the cases he recounted, he had forgotten the
actual provocation, but remembered in great detail the course of the ensuing
battle. The plumber, apparently, was playing some variation of “Why Does This
Always Happen to Me?” (WAHM).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NIGYSOB is a two-handed game which must be distinguished
from “Ain’t It Awful?” (AIA). In AIA the agent seeks injustices in order to
complain about them to a third party, making a three-handed game: Aggressor,
Victim, Confidant. AIA is played under the slogan “Misery Loves Company.” The
confidant is usually someone who also plays AIA. WAHM is three-handed, too, but
here the agent is trying to establish his pre-eminence in misfortune and
resents competition from other unfortunates. NIGYSOB is commercialized in a
three-handed professional form as the “badger game.” It may also be played as a
two-handed marital game in more or less subtle forms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The best antithesis is correct behavior. The
contractual structure of a relationship with a NIGYSOB player should be
explicitly stated in detail at the first opportunity, and the rules strictly
adhered to. In clinical practice, for example, the question of payment for
missed appointments or cancellations must be settled clearly at once, and extra
precautions must be taken to avoid mistakes in bookkeeping. If an unforeseen contretemps
arises, the antithesis is to yield gracefully without dispute, until such time
as the therapist is prepared to deal with the game. In everyday life, business
dealings with NIGYSOB players are always calculated risks. The wife of such a
person should be treated with polite correctness, and even the mildest
flirtations, gallantries or slights should be avoided, especially if the
husband himself seems to encourage them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ANALYSIS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis: Now I’ve got you, you son of a bitch. Aim: Justification.
Roles: Victim, Aggressor. Dynamics:  Jealous rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examples: (1) I caught you this time. (2) Jealous husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult:   “See, you have done wrong.” Adult:   “Now   that 
you   draw   it   to  my  attention,   I guess I have.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psychological Paradigm: Parent-Child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parent:   “I’ve been watching you, hoping you’d make a slip.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Child:   “You caught me this time.” Parent:   “Yes, and I’m
going to let you feel the full force of my fury.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moves; (I) Provocation—Accusation. (2) Defense-Accusation.
(3) Defense—Punishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological-justification for
rage. (2) External Psychological—avoids confrontation of own deficiencies. (3)
Internal Social-NIGYSOB. (4) External Social—they’re always out to get you. (5)
Biological-belligerent exchanges, usually ipsisexual. (6) Existential—people
can’t be trusted.</p>

<h3>5. See What You Made Me Do </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. In its classical form this is a marital game, and in
fact is a “three-star marriage buster,” but it may also be played between
parents and children and in working life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(1) First-Degree SWYMD: White, feeling unsociable, becomes
engrossed in some activity which tends to insulate him against people. Perhaps
all he wants at the moment is to be left alone. An intruder, such as his wife
or one of his children, comes either for stroking or to ask him something like,
“Where can I find the long-nosed pliers?” This interruption “causes” his
chisel, paintbrush, typewriter or soldering iron to slip, whereupon he turns on
the intruder in a rage and cries, “See what you made me do.” As this is
repeated through the years, his family tends more and more to leave him alone
when he is engrossed. Of course it is not the intruder but his own irritation
which “causes’ the slip, and he is only too happy when it occurs, since it
gives him a lever for ejecting the visitor. Unfortunately this is a game which
is only too easily learned by young children, so that it is easily passed on
from generation to generation. The underlying satisfaction and advantages are
more clearly demonstrated when it is played more seductively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(2) Second-Degree SWYMD: If SWYMD is the basis for a way of
life, rather than merely being used occasionally as a protective mechanism,
White marries a woman who plays “I’m Only Trying to Help You” or one of its
relatives. It is then easy for him to defer decisions to her. Often this may be
done in the guise of considerateness or gallantry. He may deferentially and
courteously let her decide where to go for dinner or which movie to see. If
things cum out well, he can enjoy them. If not, he can blame her by saying or
implying: “You Got Me Into This,” a simple variation of SWYMD. Or he may throw
the burden of decisions regarding the children’s upbringing on her, while he
acts as executive officer; if the children get upset he can play a straight
game of SWYMD. This lays the groundwork through the years For blaming mother if
the children turn out badly; then SWYMD is not an end in itself, but merely
offers passing satisfaction on the way to “I Told You So” or “See What You’ve
Done Now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The professional player who pays his psychological way with
SWYMD will use it also in his work. In occupational SWYMD the long-suffering
look of resentment replaces words. The player “democratically” or as part of “good
management” asks his assistants for suggestions. In this way he may attain an
unassailable position for terrorizing his juniors. Any mistake he makes can be
used against them by blaming them for it. Used against seniors (blaming them
for one’s mistakes), it becomes self-destructive and may lead to termination of
employment or, in the army, to transfer to another unit. In that case it is a
component of “Why Does This Always Happen To Me?” with resentful people, or of “There
I Go Again” with depressives—(both of the “Kick Me” family).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(3) Third-Degree SWYMD: in a hard form SWYMD may be played
by paranoids against people incautious enough to give them advice (.see “I’m
Only Trying to Help You”). There it may be dangerous, and in rare cases even
fatal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“See What You Made Me Do” (SWYMD) and “You Got Me Into This”
(UGMIT) complement each other nicely, so that the SWYMD-UGMlT combination is a
classical basis for the covert game contract in many marriages. This contract
is illustrated by the following sequence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By mutual agreement Mrs. White did the family bookkeeping
and paid the bills out of the joint checking account because Mr. White was “poor
at figures.” Every few months they would be notified of an overdraft, and Mr.
White would have to square it with the bank. When they looked for the source of
the difficulty, it would turn out that Mrs. White had made an expensive
purchase without telling her husband. When this came to light, Mr, White would
furiously play his UGMIT, and she would tearfully accept his rebuke and promise
it would not happen again. Everything would go smoothly for a while, and then a
creditor’s agent would suddenly appear to demand payment for a long-overdue
bill. Mr. White, not having heard of this bill, would question his wife about
it. She would then play her SWYMD, saying that it was his fault. Since he had
forbidden her to overdraw their account, the only way she could make ends meet
was by leaving this large obligation unpaid and hiding the duns from him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These games had been allowed to go on for ten years, on the
basis that each occurrence would be the last, and that from then on it would be
different—which it was, for a few months. In therapy Mr. White very cleverly
analyzed this game without any assistance from the therapist, and also devised
an effective remedy. By mutual agreement he and Mrs. White put all charge
accounts and their bank account in his name. Mrs. White continued to do the bookkeeping
and make out the checks, but Mr. White saw the hills first and controlled the
outgoing payments. In this way neither duns nor overdrafts could get by him,
and they now shared the budgetary labor. Deprived of die satisfactions and
advantages of SWYMD-UGMIT, the Whites were at first at a loss, and were then
driven to find more open and constructive types of gratification from each
other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The antithesis to First-Degree SWYMD is to leave
the player alone, and to Second-Degree SWYMD to throw the decision back on
White. The First-Degree player may react by feeling forlorn, but seldom angry;
the Second-Degree player may become sulky if he is forced to take the
initiative, so that systematic anti-SWYMD leads to disagreeable consequences.
The antithesis to Third-Degree SWYMD should be put into competent professional
hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PARTIAL ANALYSIS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The aim of this game is vindication. Dynamically the mild
form may be related to premature ejaculation, the hard form to rage based on “castration”
anxiety. It is easily acquired by children. The external psychological gain
Cavoidance of responsibility) is prominent, and the game is often precipitated
by the threat of impending intimacy, since the “justifiable” anger offers a
good excuse for avoiding sexual relations. The existential position is, “I am
blameless,”</p>

<h2>Chapter Seven. Marital Games</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>ALMOST any game can form the scaffolding For married life
and family living, but some, such as “IF It Weren’t for You,” flourish better
or, like “Frigid Woman,” are tolerated longer, under the legal force of
contractual intimacy. Marital games, of course, can only be arbitrarily
separated from sexual games, which are treated is a separate section. Those
games which characteristically evolve into their most full-blown forms in the
marital relationship include “Comer,” “Courtroom,” “Frigid Woman” and “Frigid
Man,” “Harried,” “If It Weren’t for You,” “Look How Hard I’ve Tried” and “Sweetheart.”</p>

<h3>1. Corner</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. Comer illustrates more clearly than most games their
manipulative aspect and their function as barriers to intimacy. Paradoxically,
it consists of a disingenuous refusal to play the game of another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Mrs. White suggests to her husband that they go to a
movie. Mr. White agrees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2a. Mrs. White makes an “unconscious” slip. She mentions
quite naturally in the course of conversation that the house needs painting.
This is an expensive project, and White has recently told her that their
finances are strained; he requested her not to embarrass or annoy him by
suggesting unusual expenditures, at least until the beginning of the new month.
This is therefore an ill-chosen moment to bring up the condition of the house,
and White responds rudely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2b. Alternatively: White steers the conversation around to
the house, making it difficult for Mrs. White to resist die temptation to say
that it needs painting. As in the previous case,   White   responds  rudely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Mrs. White takes offense and says that if he is in one of
his bad moods, she will not go to die movie with him, and he had best go by
himself. He says if that is die way she feels about it, he will go alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. White goes to die movie (or out with the boys), leaving
Mrs. White at home to nurse her injured feelings. There are two possible
gimmicks in diis game: A. Mrs. White knows very well from past experience that
she is not supposed to take his annoyance seriously. What he really wants is
for her to show some appreciation of how hard he works to earn their living;
then diey could go off happily together. But she refuses to play, and he feels
badly lei down. He leaves filled with disappointment and resentment, while she
stays at home looking abused, but with a secret feeling of triumph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>B. White knows very well from past experience diat he is not
supposed to take her pique seriously. What she really wants is to be honeyed
out of it; then they would go off happily together. But he refuses to play,
knowing that his refusal is dishonest: he knows she wants to be coaxed, but
pretends he doesn’t. He leaves the house, feeling cheerful and relieved, but
looking wronged. She is left feeling disappointed and resentful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In each of diese cases die winner’s position is, from a
naive standpoint, irreproachable; all he or she has done js take the other
literally. This is clearer in (B), where White takes Mrs. White’s refusal to go
at face value. They both know that this is cheating, but since she said it, she
is cornered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most obvious gain here is die external psychological.
Both of diem find movies sexually stimulating, and it is more or less anticipated
that after they return from the theater, they will make love. Hence whichever
one of them wants to avoid intimacy sets up the game in move (2a)///or (2b).
This is a particularly exasperating variety of “Uproar” (see Chapter 9). The “wronged”
party can, of course, make a good case for not wanting to make love in a state
of justifiable indignation, and the cornered spouse has no recourse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. This is simple for Mrs. White. All she has to do
is change her mind, take her husband by the arm, smile and go along with him (a
shift from Child to Adult ego state). It is more difficult for Mr. White, since
she now has die initiative; but if he reviews die whole situation, he may be
able to coax her into going along with him, either as a sulky Child who has been
placated or, better, as an Adult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Comer” is found in a somewhat different form as a family
game involving the children, where it resembles the “double-bind” described by
Bateson and his associates.1 Here the child is cornered, so that whatever he
does is wrong. According to the Bateson school, this may be an important
etiological factor in schizophrenia. In the present language, then, schizophrenia
may be a child’s antithesis to “Corner.” Experience in treating adult
schizophrenics with game analysis bears this out—that is, if the family game of
“Comer” is analyzed to demonstrate that the schizophrenic behavior was and is
specifically undertaken to counter this game, partial or total remission occurs
in a properly prepared patient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An everyday form of “Corner” which is played by the whole
family and is most likely to affect the character development of the younger
children occurs with meddlesome “Parental” parents. The little boy or girl is
urged to be more helpful around the house, but when he is, the parents find
fault with what he does—a homely example of “damned if you do and damned if you
don’t.” This “double-bind” may be called the Dilemma Type of “Corner.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Comer” is sometimes found as an etiological factor in asthmatic
children.///Little girl:   “Mommy, do you love me?” Mother: “What is love?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This answer leaves the child with no direct recourse. She
wants to talk about mother, and mother switches the subject to philosophy,
which the little girl is not equipped to handle. She begins to breathe hard, mother
is irritated, asthma sets in, mother apologizes and the “Asthma Game” now runs
its course. This “Asthma” type of “Comer” remains to be studied further.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An elegant variant, which may be called the “Russell-Whitehead
Type” of “Comer,” sometimes occurs in therapy groups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Black: “Well, anyway, when we’re silent nobody is playing
games.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White: “Silence itself may be a game.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Red:  “Nobody was playing games today.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White:   “But not playing games may itself be a game,**</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The therapeutic antithesis is equally elegant. Logical
paradoxes are forbidden. When White is deprived of this maneuver, his underlying
anxieties come quickly to the fore. Closely allied to “Comer” on the one hand,
and to “Threadbare” on the other, is the marital game of “Lunch Bag.” The husband,
who can well afford to have lunch at a good restaurant, nevertheless makes
himself a few sandwiches every morning, which he takes to the office in a paper
bag. In this way he uses up crusts of bread, leftovers from dinner and paper
bags which his wife saves for him. This gives him complete control over the
family finances, for what wife would dare buy herself a mink stole in die face
of such self-sacrifice? The husband reaps numerous other advantages, such as
die privilege of eating lunch by himself and of catching up on his work during
lunch hour. In many ways this is a constructive game which Benjamin Franklin
would have approved of, since it encourages the virtues of thrift, hard work
and punctuality.</p>

<h3>2. Courtroom</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. Descriptively this belongs to the class of games
which find their most florid expressions in law, and which includes “Wooden Leg”
(the plea of insanity) and “Debtor” (the civil suit). Clinically it is most
often seen in marital counseling and marital psychotherapy groups. Indeed, some
marital counseling and marital groups consist of a perpetual game of “Courtroom”
in which nothing is resolved, since the game is never broken up. In such cases
it becomes evident that the counselor or therapist is heavily involved in the
game without being aware of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Courtroom” can be played by any number, but is essentially
three-handed, with a plaintiff, a defendant and a judge, represented by a
husband, a wife and the therapist. If it is played in a therapy group or over
the radio or TV, die other members of the audience are cast as the jury. The
husband begins plaintively, “Let me te!l you what (wife’s name) did yesterday.
She took the ...” etc., etc. The wife then responds defensively, “Here is the
way it really was ... and besides just before that he was ... and anyway at die
time we were both ...” etc. The husband adds gallantly, “Well, I’m glad you
people have a chance to hear both sides of the story, I only want to be fair.”
At this point the counselor says judiciously, “It seems to me that if we
consider ...” etc., etc. If there is an audience, the therapist may throw it to
them with: “Well, let’s hear what the others have to say.” Or, if the group is
already trained, they will play the jury without any instruction from him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The therapist says to the husband, “You’re absolutely
right!” If the husband relaxes complacently or triumphantly, the therapist
asks: “How do you feel about my saying that?” The husband replies: “Fine.” Then
the therapist says, “Actually, I feel you’re in the wrong.” If the husband is
honest, he will say: “I knew that all along.” If be is not honest, he will show
‘some reaction that makes it clear a game is in progress. Then it becomes
possible to go into the matter further. The game element lies in the fact that
while the plaintiff’ is overtly clamoring for victory, fundamentally he
believes that he is wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After   sufficient   clinical   material   has   been  
gathered   to clarify   the   situation,   the   game   can   be  
interdicted   by  a maneuver which is one of the most elegant in  die whole art
of antithetics.   The  therapist makes a rule prohibiting the use of the 
(grammatical)   third person  in  the group. Thenceforward  the members can 
only address each  other directly as “you” or talk about themselves as “I,” but
they cannot say, “Let me tell you about him” or “Let me tell you   about   her.”  
At   this   point   the   couple   stop   playing games in the group
altogether, or shift into “Sweetheart,” which   is   some   improvement,   or  
take   up   “Furthermore,” which is no help at all. “Sweetheart” is described
in another section  (page   107).   In  “Furthermore”  the plaintiff makes one 
accusation  after  the  other.   The  defendant  replies  to each,   “I can
explain.” The plaintiff pays no attention  to the explanation, but as soon as
the defendant pauses,  he launches into his next indictment  with  another  “furthermore,”
which is followed by another explanation—a typical Parent-Child interchange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Furthermore” is played most intensively by paranoid defendants.
Because of their literalness, it is particularly easy for them to frustrate
accusers who express themselves in humorous or metaphorical terms. In general,
metaphors are the most obvious traps to avoid in a game of “Furthermore.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In its everyday form, “Courtroom” is easily observed in children
as a three-handed game between two siblings and a parent. “Mommy, she took my
candy away.” “Yes, but he took my doll, and before that he was hitting me, and
anyway we both promised to share our candy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ANALYSIS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis: They’ve got to say I’m right. Aim: Reassurance.///Roles:
Plaintiff, Defendant, Judge (and/or Jury). Dynamics: Sibling rivalry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examples: (I) Children quarreling, parent intervenes. (2) Married
couple, seek “help.” Social Paradigm:  Adult-Adult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult: “This is what she did to me.” Adult: “The real facts
are diese.” Psychological Paradigm: Child-Parent. Child:  “Tell me I’m right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parent:   “This one is right.” Or:  “You’re both right.”
Moves: (1) Complaint filed—Defense filed. (2) Plaintiff files rebuttal,  
concession,   or  good-will   gesture.   (3)   Decision of judge or
instructions to jury. (4) Final decision filed. Advantages;   (1)    Internal  
Psychological—projection   of guilt. (2) External Psychological—excused from
guilt.  (3) Internal    Social—”Sweetheart,”    “Furthermore,”    “Uproar”
and   others.   (4)   External   Social—”Courtroom.”   (5)   Biological—stroking  
from   judge   and   jury.   (6)   Existential-depressive position, I’m always
wrong.</p>

<h3>3. Frigid Woman</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is almost always a marital game, since it is
hardly conceivable that an informal liaison would present the required
opportunities and privileges over a sufficient length of time, or that such a
liaison would be maintained in the face of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The husband makes advances to his wife and is repulsed.
After repeated attempts, he is told that all men are beasts, he doesn’t really
love her, or doesn’t love her for herself, that all he is interested in is sex.
He desists for a time, then tries again with the same result. Eventually he
resigns himself and makes no furdier advances. As the weeks or months pass, the
wife becomes increasingly informal and sometimes forgetful. She walks through
the bedroom half dressed or forgets her clean towel when she takes a bath so
that he has to bring it to her. If she plays a hard game or drinks heavily, she
may become flirtatious with other men at parties. At lengdi he responds to
those provocations and tries again. Once more he is repulsed, and a game of “Uproar”
ensues involving their recent behavior, other couples, their in-laws, their finances
and their failures, terminated by a slamming door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This time the husband makes up his mind that he is really
through, that they will find a sexless modus vivendi, Months pass. He declines
the negligee parade and the forgotten towel maneuver. The wife becomes more
provocatively informal and more provocatively forgetful, but he still resists.
Then one evening she actually approaches him and kisses him. At first he doesn’t
respond, remembering his resolution, but soon nature begins to take its course
after the long famine, and now he thinks he surely has it made. His first
tentative advances are not repulsed. He becomes bolder and bolder. Just at the
critical point, the wife steps back and cries: “See, what did I tell you! All
men are beasts, all I wanted was affection, but all you are interested in is
sex!” The ensuing game of “Uproar” at diis point may skip the preliminary
phases of their recent behavior and their in-laws, and go right to the
financial problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It should be noted that in spite of his protestations, the
husband is usually just as afraid of sexual intimacy as his wife   is,   and 
has  carefully  chosen   his   mate   to  minimize • the danger of overtaxing his
disturbed potency, which he can now blame on her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In its everyday form this game is played by unmarried ladies
of various ages, which soon earns them a common slang epidiet. With diem it
often merges into the game of indignation, or “Rapo.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. This is a dangerous game, and the possible
antitheses are equally dangerous. Taking a mistress is a gamble. In the face of
such stimulating competition, the wife may give up the game and try to initiate
a normal married life, perhaps too late. On the other hand, she may use the
affair, often with the help of a lawyer, as ammunition against the husband in a
game of “Now I’ve Got You, You Son of a Bitch.” The outcome is equally unpredictable
if the husband undertakes psychotherapy and she does not. The wife’s game may
collapse as the husband grows stronger, leading to healthier adjustment; but if
she is a hard player, improvement on his part may result in divorce. The best
solution, if available, is for both parties to go into a transactional marital
group, where the underlying advantages of the game and the basic sexual
pathology can be laid bare. With this preparation both spouses may become
interested in intensive individual psychotherapy. That may result in a psychological
remarriage. If not, at least each of the parties may make a more sensible
readjustment to the situation than they might have otherwise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The decent antithesis for the everyday form is to find
another social companion. Some of the shrewder or more brutal antitheses are
corrupt and even criminal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relatives. The converse game, “Frigid Man,” is less common,
but it takes much the same general course with some variations in detail. The
final outcome depends upon the scripts of the parties involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The crucial point of “Frigid Woman” is the terminal phase of
“Uproar.” Once diis has run its course, sexual intimacy is out of the question,
since both parties derive a perverse satisfaction from “Uproar” and have no
need of furdier sexual excitement from each other. Hence the most important
item in anti-”Frigid Woman” is to decline “Uproar.” This leaves the wife in a
state of sexual dissatisfaction which may be so acute that she will become more
compliant. The use made of “Uproar” distinguishes “Frigid Woman” from “Beat Me
Daddy,” where “Uproar” is part of the foreplay; in “Frigid Woman,” “Uproar”
sub-titutes for the sex act itself. Thus in “Beat Me Daddy,” “Uproar” is a
condition of the sexual act, a kind of fetish which increases the excitement,
while in “Frigid Woman,” once “Uproar” has taken place, die episode is
finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An early analogue of “Frigid Woman” is played by that type
of prissy little girl described by Dickens in Great Expectations. She comes out
in her starched dress and asks the little boy to make her a mud pie. Then she
sneers at his dirty hands and clothing and tells him how clean she is,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ANALYSIS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis:  Now I’ve got you, you son of a bitch. Aim:  Vindication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roles: Proper Wife, Inconsiderate Husband. Dynamics: Penis
envy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examples:  (1)  Thank you  for the mud pie, you dirty little
boy.  (2) Provocative, frigid wife. Social Paradigm: Parent-Child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parent:   “I  give you  permission   to  make  me a  mud pie
(kiss me)-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Child:   “I’d love to.” Parent:   “Now see how dirty you
are.” Psychological Paradigm: Child-Parent. Child:  “See if vou can seduce me.”
Parent:   ‘Til try, if you stop me.” Child:   “See, it was you who started it”
Moves:   (1)   Seduction-Response.   (2)   Rejection-Resignation.   (3) 
Provocation-Response.   (4)  Rejection-Uproar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—freedom from guilt
for sadistic fantasies. (2) External Psychological—avoids feared exhibition and
penetration. (3) Internal Social—”Uproar.” (4) External Social—What do you do
with dirty little boys (husbands)? (5) Biological—inhibited sex play and belligerent
exchanges. (6) Existential—I am pure.</p>

<h3>4. Harried</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. 7Tiis is a game played by the harried housewife. Her
situation requires that she be proficient in ten or twelve different
occupations; or, stated otherwise, that she fill gracefully ten or twelve
different roles. From time to time semi-facetious lists of diese occupations or
roles appear in the Sunday supplements: mistress, mother, nurse, housemaid,
etc. Since these roles are usually conflicting and fatiguing, their imposition
gives rise in the course of years to the condition symbolically known as “Housewife’s
Knee” (since the knee is used for rocking, scrubbing, lifting, driving and so
forth), whose symptoms are succinctly summarized in the complaint: “I’m tired.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, if the housewife is able to set her own pace and find
enough satisfaction in loving her husband and children, she will not merely
serve but enjoy her twenty-five years, and see the youngest child off to
college with a pang of loneliness. But if on die one hand she is driven by her
inner Parent and called to account by the critical husband she has chosen for
that purpose, and on the other unable to get sufficient satisfaction from
loving her family, she may grow more and more unhappy. At first she may try to
console herself with the advantages of “If It Weren’t For You” and “Blemish”
(and indeed, any housewife may fall back on these when the going gets rough);
but soon these fail to keep her going. Then she has to find another way out,
and that is the game of “Harried,”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The thesis of this game is simple. She takes on everything
that comes, and even asks for more. She agrees with her husband’s criticisms
and accepts all her children’s demands. If she has to entertain at dinner, she
not only feels she must function impeccably as a conversationalist, chatelaine
over the household and servants, interior decorator, caterer, glamor girl,
virgin queen and diplomat; she will also volunteer that morning to bake a cake
and take the children to the dentist. If she already feels harassed, she makes
the day even more harried. Then in the middle of the afternoon she justifiably
collapses, and nothing gets done. She lets down her husband, the children and
their guests, and her self-reproaches add to her misery. After this happens two
or three times her marriage is in jeopardy, the children are confused, she
loses weight, her hair is untidy, her face is drawn and her shoes are scuffed.
Then she appears at the psychiatrist’s office, ready to be hospitalized.///Antithesis.
The logical anitithesis is simple: Mrs. White can fill each of her roles in
succession during the week, but she must refuse to play two or more of them
simultaneously. When she gives a cocktail party. For example, she can play
either caterer or nursemaid, but not both. If she is merely suffering from Housewife’s
Knee, she may be able to limit herself in this way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If she is actually playing a game of “Harried,” however, it
will be very difficult for her to adhere to this principle. In that case the
husband is carefully chosen; he is an otherwise reasonable man who will
criticize his wife if she is not as efficient as he thinks his mother was. In
effect, she marries his fantasy of his mother as perpetuated in his Parent,
which is similar to her fantasy of her mother or grandmother. Having found a
suitable partner, her Child can now settle into the harassed role necessary to
maintain her psychic balance, and which she will not readily give up. The more
occupational responsibility the husband has, the easier it is for both of them
to find Adult reasons to preserve the unhealthy aspects of their relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the position becomes untenable, often because of
official school intervention on behalf of the unhappy offspring, the psychiatrist
is called in to make it a diree-handed game. Either the husband wants him to do
an overhaul job in the wife, or the wife wants him as an ally against the
husband. The ensuing proceedings depend on the skill and alertness of die psychiatrist.
Usually the first phase, the alleviation of the wife’s depression, will proceed
smoothly. The second phase, in which she will give up playing “Harried” in
favor of playing “Psychiatry,” is the decisive one. It tends to arouse
increasing opposition from both spouses. Sometimes this is well concealed and
then explodes suddenly, though not unexpectedly. If this stage is weathered,
dien the real work of game analysis can proceed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is necessary to recognize that the real culprit is the
wife’s Parent, her mother or grandmother; the husband is to some extent only a
lay figure chosen to play his role in die game. The therapist has to fight not
only diis Parent and the husband, who has a heavy investment in playing his
end, but also the social environment, which encourages the wife’s compliance.
The week after the article appears about the many roles a housewife has to
play, there is a How’nt I Doing? in the Sunday paper: a ten-item test to
determine “How Good A Hostess (Wife) (Modier) (Housekeeper) (Budgeteer) Are
You?” For the housewife who plays “Harried,” that is the equivalent of the
litde leaflet that comes with children’s games, stating the rules. It may help
to speed up die evolution of “Harried,” which, if not checked, may end in a
game of “State Hospital” (“The last thing I want is to be sent to a hospital”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One practical difficulty with such couples is that die
husband tends to avoid personal involvement with the treatment beyond playing “Look
How Hard I’m Trying,” because he is usually more disturbed than he cares to
admit. Instead he may send indirect messages to the thera* pist, through temper
outbursts which he knows will be reported by the wife. Hence “Harried” easily
progresses to a third-degree Hfe-death-divorce struggle. The psychiatrist is almost
alone on the side of life, assisted only by the harried Adult of the patient
which is locked in combat that may prove mortal against all three aspects of
the husband, allied widi her own inner Parent and Child. It is a dramatic
battle, with odds of two against five, which tries the skill of the most
game-free and professional therapist. If he quails, he can take the easy way
out and offer his patient on the altar of the divorce court, which is
equivalent to saying “I surrender—Let’s you and him fight.”</p>

<h3>5. If It Weren’t For You</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. The detailed analysis of this game has already been
given in Chapter 5. It was historically die second game uncovered, after “Why
Don’t You—Yes But,” which up to that point had been regarded merely as an
interesting phenomenon. With the additional discovery of IWFY, it became clear
that there must be a whole department of social action based on ulterior
transactions. This led to a more active search for such goings-on, and the
present collection is one outcome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Briefly, a woman marries a domineering man so that he will restrict
her activities and thus keep her from getting into situations which frighten
her. If this were a simple operation, she might express her gratitude when he
performed this service for her. In the game of IWFY, however, her reaction is
quite the opposite: she takes advantage of the situation to complain about the
restrictions, which makes her spouse feel uneasy and gives her all sorts of advantages.
This game is the internal social advantage. The external social advantage is
the derivative pastime “If It Weren’t For Him,” which she plays with her
congenial lady friends.</p>

<h3>6. Look How Hard I’ve Tried </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. In its common clinical form this is a three-handed
game played by a married couple with a psychiatrist. The husband (usually) is
bucking for a divorce, despite loud protestations to the contrary, while the
spouse is more sincere in wanting to continue the marriage. He comes to the
therapist under protest and talks just enough to demonstrate to the wife that
he is cooperating; usually he plays a mild game of “Psychiatry” or “Courtroom.”
As time passes he exhibits either increasingly resentful pseudo-compliance or
belligerent argumentativeness toward the therapist. At home he initially shows
more “understanding” and restraint, and finally behaves worse than ever. After
one, five or ten visits, depending on the skill of the therapist, he refuses to
come any longer and goes hunting or fishing instead. The wife is then forced
into filing for divorce. The husband is now blameless, since his wife has taken
the initiative and he has demonstrated his good faith by going to the
therapist. He is in a good position to say to any attorney, judge, friend or
relative, “Look how hard I’ve tried!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The couple is seen together. If one—let us say
the husband—is clearly playing this game, the other is taken into individual
treatment and the player is sent on his way, on the valid ground that he is
less ready for therapy. He can still get a divorce, but only at die expense of
abandoning his position that he is really trying. If necessary, the wife can
start the divorce, and her position is much improved since she really has
tried. The favorable, hoped-for outcome is that the husband, his game broken
up, will go into a state of despair and then seek treatment elsewhere with
genuine motivation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In its everyday form this is easily observed in children as
a two-handed game with one parent. It is played from either of two positions: “I
am helpless” or “I am blameless.” The child tries, but bungles or is
unsuccessful. If he is Helpless, the parent has to do it for him. If he is
Blameless, the parent has no reasonable grounds for punishing him. This reveals
the elements of the game. The parents should find out two things: which of them
taught the child this game; and what they are doing to perpetuate it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An interesting, though sometimes sinister, variant is “Look
How Hard I Was Trying,” which is usually a harder game of the second or third
degree. This can be illustrated by the case of a hard-working man with a
gastric ulcer. There are many people with progressive physical disabilities who
do the best they can to cope with the situation, and they may enlist the help
of their families in a legitimate way. Such conditions, however, can also be exploited
for ulterior purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First Degree: A man announces to his wife and friends that
he has an ulcer. He also lets them know that he is continuing to work. This
elicits their admiration. Perhaps a person with a painful and unpleasant
condition is entitled to a certain amount of ostentation as a poor recompense
for his suffering. He should be given due credit for not playing “Wooden Leg”
instead, and deserves some reward for continuing to assume his
responsibilities. In such a case, die courteous reply to ‘Took How Hard I’m
Trying” is, “Yes, we all admire your fortitude and conscientiousness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second Degree: A man is told that he has an ulcer, but keeps
it a secret from his wife and friends. He continues working and worrying as
hard as ever, and one day he collapses on the job. When his wife is notified,
she gets the message instantly: “Look How Hard I Was Trying.” Now she is
supposed to appreciate him as she never has before, and to feel sorry for all
the mean things she has said and done in the past. In short, she is now
supposed to love him, all previous methods of wooing her having failed. Unfortunately
for the husband, her manifestations of affection and solicitude at this point
are more apt to be motivated by guilt than by love. Deep down she is likely to
be resentful because he is using unfair leverage against her, and has also
taken unfair advantage of her by keeping his illness a secret. In short, a
diamond bracelet is a much more honest instrument of courtship than a
perforated stomach. She has the option of throwing the jewelry back at him, but
she cannot decently walk out on the ulcer. A sudden confrontation with a
serious illness is more likely to make her feel trapped than won over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This game can often be discovered immediately after the patient
first hears that he has a potentially progressive disability. If he is going to
play it, the whole plan will very likely flash through his mind at that point,
and can be recovered by a careful psychiatric review of the situation. What is
recovered is the secret gloating of his Child at learning that he has such a
weapon, masked by his Adult concern at the practical problems raised by his
illness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Third Degree: Even more sinister and spiteful is the sudden
unheralded suicide because of serious illness. The ulcer progresses to cancer,
and one day the wife, who has never been informed that anything serious is
amiss, walks into’ the bathroom and finds her husband lying there dead. The
note says clearly enough, “Look How Hard I Was Trying.” If something like this
happens twice to the same woman, it is time for her to find out what she has
been playing.</p>

<h3>7. Sweetheart</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is seen in its fullest flower in the early
stages of marital group therapy, when the parties feel defensive; it can also
be observed on social occasions. White makes a subtly derogatory remark about
Mrs. White, disguised as an anecdote, and ends: “Isn’t that right, sweetheart?”
Mrs. White tends to agree for two ostensibly Adult reasons: (a) because the
anecdote itself is, in the main, accurately reported, and to disagree about
what is presented as a peripheral detail (but is really the essential point of
the transaction) would seem pedantic; (b) because it would seem surly to
disagree with a man who calls one “sweetheart” in public. The psychological
reason for her agreement, however, is her depressive position. She married him
precisely because she knew he would perform this service for her: exposing her
deficiencies and thus saving her from the embarrassment of having to expose them
herself. Her parents accommodated her the same way when she was little.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next to “Courtroom,” this is the most common game played in
marital groups. The more tense the situation, and the closer the game is to
exposure, the more bitterly is the word “sweetheart” enunciated, until the
underlying resentment becomes obvious. On careful consideration it can be seen
that this is a relative of “Schlemiel,” since the significant move is Mrs.
White’s implicit forgiveness for White’s resentment, of which she is trying
hard not to be aware. Hence anti-”Sweetheart” is played analogously to anti-”Schlemiel”:
“You can tell derogatory anecdotes about me, but please don’t call me ‘sweetheart’”
This antithesis carries with it the same perils as does anti-”Schlemiel.” A more
sophisticated and less dangerous antithesis is to reply: “Yes, honey!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In another form the wife, instead of agreeing, responds with
a similar “Sweetheart” type anecdote about the husband, saying in effect, “You
have a dirty face too, dear.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes the endearments are not actually pronounced, but a
careful listener can hear them even when they are unspoken. This is “Sweetheart,”
Silent Type.</p>

<h2>Chapter Eight. Party Games</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>PARTIES are for pastimes, and pastimes are for parties (including
the period before a group meeting officially begins), but as acquaintanceship
ripens, games begin to emerge. The Schlemiel and his victim recognize each
odier, as do Big Daddy and Little Old Me; all the familiar but disregarded
processes of selection get under way. In this section four games which are
typically played in ordinary social situations are considered: “Ain’t It Awful,”
“Blemish,” “Schlemiel,” and “Why Don’t You—Yes But.”</p>

<h3>1. Ain’t It Awful</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is played in four significant forms: Parental
pastime, Adult pastime, Child pastime and game. In the pastimes there is no
denouement or payoff, but much un-wordiy feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. “Nowadays” is the self-righteous, punitive or even
vicious parental pastime. Sociologically it is common among certain types of
middle-aged women with small independent incomes. One such woman withdrew from
a therapy group when her opening move was met with silence instead of with the
excited corroboration she was accustomed to in her social circle. In this more
sophisticated group, accustomed to game analysis, there was a conspicuous lack
of togetherness when White remarked: “Speaking of not trusting people, it’s no
wonder you can’t trust anyone nowadays. I was looking through the desk of one
of my roomers, and you won’t believe what I found.” She knew the answers to
most of the current community problems: juvenile delinquency (parents too soft
nowadays); divorce (wives without enough to do to keep them busy nowadays);
crime (foreigners moving into white neighborhoods nowadays); and rising prices
(businessmen too grasping nowadays). She made it clear that she herself was not
soft with her delinquent son, nor with her delinquent tenants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nowadays” is differentiated from idle gossip hy its slogan “It’s
no wonder.” The opening move may be the same C’They say that Flossie Murgatroyd”),
but in “Nowadays” there is direction and closure; an “explanation” may be
offered. Idle gossip merely rambles or trails off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. “Broken Skin” is the more benevolent Adult variation,
with the slogan “What a pity!” although the underlying motivations are equally
morbid. “Broken Skin” deals primarily with the flow of blood; it is essentially
an informal clinical colloquium. Anyone is eligible to present a case, the more
horrifying the better, and details are eagerly considered. Blows in the face, abdominal
operations and difficult childbirths are accepted topics. Here the differentiation
from idle gossip lies in the rivalry and surgical sophistication. Pathological
anatomy, diagnosis, prognosis and comparative case studies are systematically
pursued. A good prognosis is approved in idle gossip, but in “Broken Skin” a
consistently hopeful outlook, unless obviously insincere, may invoke a secret
meeting of the Credentials Committee because the player is—non—particeps
criminis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. “Water Cooler,” or “Coffee Break,” is the Child pastime,
with the slogan “Look what they’re doing to us now.” This is an organizational
variant. It may be played after dark in the milder political or economic form
called “Bar Stool.” It is actually three-handed, the ace being held by the
often shadowy figure called “They.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. As a game, “Ain’t It Awful” finds its most dramatic expression
in polysurgery addicts, and their transactions illustrate its characteristics.
These are doctor-shoppers, people who actively seek surgery even in the face of
sound medical opposition. The experience itself, the hospitalizarion and
surgery, brings its own advantages. The internal psychological advantage comes
from having the body mutilated; the external psychological advantage lies in
the avoidance of all intimacies and responsibilities except complete surrender
to the surgeon. The biological advantages are typified by nursing care. The
internal social advantages come from the medical and nursing staff, and from
other patients. After the patient’s discharge the external social advantages
are gained by provoking sympathy and awe. In its extreme form this game is
played professionally by fraudulent or determined liability and malpractice
claimants, who may earn a living by deliberately or opportunistically incurring
disabilities. They then demand not only sympathy, as amateur players do, but
indemnification. “Ain’t It Awful” becomes a game, then, when the player overtly
expresses distress, but is covertly gratified at the prospect of the
satisfactions he can wring from his misfortune.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In general, people who suffer misfortunes may be divided
into three classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Those in whom the suffering is inadvertent and unwanted.
These may or may not exploit the sympathy which is so readily offered to them.
Some exploitation is natural enough, and may be treated with common courtesy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Those in whom the suffering is inadvertent, but is
gratefully received because of the opportunities for exploitation it offers.
Here the game is an afterthought, a “secondary gain” in Freud’s sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Those who seek suffering, like polysurgery addicts who go
from one surgeon to another until they find one willing to operate. Here the
game is the primary consideration.</p>

<h3>2. Blemish</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This game is the source of a large percentage of
petty dissension in everyday life; it is played from the depressive Child
position “I am no good,” which is protectively transformed into the Parental
position “They are no good.” The player’s transactional problem is, then, to
prove the latter thesis. Hence “Blemish” players do not feel comfortable with a
new person until they have found his blemish. In its hardest form it may become
a totalitarian political game played by “authoritarian” personalities, and then
it may have serious historical repercussions. Here its close relationship with “Nowadays”
is evident. In suburban society positive reassurance is obtained from playing “How’m
I Doing?” while “Blemish” provides negative reassurance. A partial analysis
will make some of the elements of this game clearer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The premise may range from the most trivial and extraneous (“Last
year’s hat”), to the most cynical (“Hasn’t got $7,000 in the bank”), sinister (“Not
100% Aryan”), esoteric (“Hasn’t read Rilke”), intimate (“Can’t hold his
erection”) or sophisticated (“What’s he trying to prove?”). Psychodynamically
it is usually based on sexual insecurity, and its aim is reassurance. Transacn’onally
there is prying, morbid curiosity or watchfulness, sometimes with Parental or
Adult concern charitably masking the Child’s relish. It has the internal
psychological advantage of warding off depression, and the external
psychological advantage of avoiding the intimacy which might expose White’s own
blemishes. White feels justified in turning away an unfashionable woman, a man
without financial backing, a non-Aryan, an illiterate, an impotent man or’ an
insecure personality. At the same time the prying offers some internal social
action with biological gain. The external social advantage is of the “Ain’t It
Awful” family—Neighborly Type.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An interesting sidelight is that White’s choice of premise
is independent of his intellectual capacity or apparent sophistication. Thus a
man who had held some responsible positions in the foreign service of his
country told an audience that another country was inferior because, among other
things, the men wore jackets with sleeves that were too long. In his Adult ego
state this man was quite competent. Only when playing a Parental game like “Blemish”
would he mention such irrelevancies.<sup>1</sup></p>

<h3>3. Schlemiel</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. The term “schlemiel” does not refer to the hero of
Chamisso’s novel,1 who was a man without a shadow, but to a popular Yiddish
word allied to the German and Dutch words for cunning. The Schlemiel’s victim,
who is something like the “Good-Natured Fellow” of Paul de Kock,2 is
colloquially called the Schlemazl. The moves in a typical game of “Schlemiel”
are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1W.  White  spills  a highball  on  the hostess’s evening gown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IB. Black (the host) responds initially with rage, but he
senses (often only vaguely) that if he shows it, White wins. Black therefore
pulls himself together, and this gives him the illusion that he wins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2W. White says: “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2B. Black mutters or cries forgiveness, strengthening his
illusion that he wins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3W. White then proceeds to inflict other damage on Black’s
property. He breaks things, spills things and makes messes of various kinds.
After the cigarette burn in the tablecloth, the chair leg through the lace
curtain and the gravy on the rug, White’s Child is exhilarated because he has
enjoyed himself in carrying out these procedures, for all of which he has been
forgiven, while Black has made a gratifying display of suffering self-control.
Thus both of them profit from an unfortunate situation, and Black is not necessarily
anxious to terminate the friendship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As in most games, White, who makes the first move, wins either
way. If Black shows his anger, White can feel justified in returning the
resentment. If Black restrains himself, White can go on enjoying his
opportunities. The real payoff in this game, however, is not the pleasure of
destracriveness, which is merely an added bonus for White, but the fact that he
obtains forgiveness.* This leads directly into the antithesis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. Anri-”Schlemiel” is played by not offering the demanded
absolution. After White says, “I’m sorry,” Black, instead of muttering “It’s
okay,” says, “Tonight you can embarrass my wife, ruin the furniture and wreck
the rug, but please don’t say Tm sorry.’” Here Black switches from being a
Forgiving Parent to being an objective Adult who takes the full responsibility
for having invited White in the first place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The intensity of White’s game will be revealed by his
reaction, which may be quite explosive. One who plays anti-”Schlemiel” runs the
risk of immediate reprisals or, at any rate, of making an enemy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Children play “Schlemiel” in an abortive form in which they
are not always sure of forgiveness but at least have the pleasure of making
messes; as they learn to comport themselves socially, however, they may take
advantage of their increasing sophistication to obtain the forgiveness which is
the chief goal of the game as played in polite, grown-up social circles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ANALYSIS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis: I can he destructive and still get forgiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aim:   Absolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roles: Aggressor, Victim (Colloquially, Schlemiel and Schlemazl).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dynamics:  Anal  aggression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Exam-pies: (1) Messily destructive children. (2) Clumsy
guest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Social   Paradigm:  Adult-Adult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult:  “Since I’m polite, you have to be polite, too.”
Adult:   “That’s fine. I forgive you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psychological Paradigm: Child-Parent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>* The examples given for this and the next game (YDYB) follow
those given previously by the author in Transactions! Analysis.///Child: “You
have to forgive things which appear accidental.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parent: “You are right. I have to show you what good manners
are.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moves: (1) Provocation-resentment. (2) Apology-forgive—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—pleasure of messing.
(2) External Psychological—Avoids punishment. (3) Internal Social—”Schlemiel.”
(4) External Social—”Schlemiel.” (5) Biological—provocative and gentle
stroking. (6) Existential—I am blameless.</p>

<h3>4. Why Don’t You-Yes But </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. “Why Don’t You—Yes But” occupies a special place in
game analysis, because it was the original stimulus for the concept of games.
It was the first game to be dissected out of its social context, and since it is
the oldest subject of game analysis, it is one of the best understood. It is
also the game most commonly played at parties and groups of all kinds, including
psychotherapy groups. The following example will serve to illustrate its main
characteristics:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White: “My husband always insists on doing our own repairs,
and he never builds anything right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Black: “Why doesn’t he take a course in carpentry1?” White: “Yes,
but he doesn’t have time.” Blue: “Why don’t you buy him some good tools’?”
White: “Yes, but he doesn’t know how to use them.” Red:   “Why  don’t you
have   your building done by  a carpenteri1”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White:  “Yes, but that would cost too much.” Brown:   “Why
don’t you just accept what he does the way he does it}”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White: “Yes, but the whole thing might fall down.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Such an exchange is typically followed by a silence. It is
eventually broken by Green, who may say something like,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s men for you, always trying to show how efficient
they are.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>YDYB can be played by any number. The agent presents a
problem. The others start to present solutions, each beginning with “Why don’t
you ... ?” To each of these White objects with a “Yes, but ....” A good player
can stand off the others indefinitely until they all give up, whereupon White
wins. In many situations she might have to handle a dozen or more solutions to
engineer the crestfallen silence which signifies her victory, and which leaves
the field open for the next game in the above paradigm, Green switching into “PI
A,” Delinquent Husband Type.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since the solutions are, with rare exceptions, rejected, it
is apparent that this game must serve some ulterior purpose. YDYB is not played
for its ostensible purpose (an Adult quest for information or solutions), but
to reassure and gratify the Child. A bare transcript may sound Adult, but in
the living tissue it can be observed that White presents herself as a Child
inadequate to meet the situation; whereupon the others become transformed into
sage Parents anxious to dispense their wisdom for her benefit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>, Psychological   p I      Level         f</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>.A   [Social! /       . *       }   1 Level I \       fl</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White R: “Yes. but ...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others S: “Why don’t you ...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why Don’t You-Yes But &lt;  FIGURE 8  &gt;///This is
illustrated in Figure 8. The game can proceed because at the social level both
stimulus and response are Adult to Adult, and at the psychological level they
are also complementary, with Parent to Child stimulus (“Why don’t you ... •”)
eliciting Child to Parent response (“Yes, but ....”)• The psychological level
is usually unconscious on both sides, but the shifts in ego state (Adult to “inadequate”
Child on White’s part. Adult to “wise” Parent by the others) can often be
detected by an alert observer from changes in posture, muscular tone, voice and
vocabulary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to illustrate the implications, it is instructive
to follow through on the example given above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therapist: “Did anyone suggest anything you hadn’t thought
of yourself?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHite: “No, they didn’t. As a matter of fact, I’ve actually
tried almost everydiing they suggested. I did buy my husband some tools, and he
did take a course in carpentry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here White demonstrates two of the reasons why the proceedings
should not be taken at face value. First, in the majority of cases White is as
intelligent as anyone else in the company, and it is very unlikely that others
will suggest any solution that she has not thought of herself. If someone does
happen to come up with an original suggestion, White will accept it gratefully
if she is playing fair; that is, her “inadequate” Child will give way if anyone
present has an idea ingenious enough to stimulate her Adult. But habitual YDYB
players, such as White above, seldom play fair. On the other hand, a too ready
acceptance of suggestions raises the question of whether the YDYB is not
masking an underlying game of “Stupid.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The example given is particularly dramatic, because it
clearly illustrates the second point. Even if White has actually tried some of
the solutions presented, she will still object to them. The purpose of the game
is not to get suggestions, but to reject them.///While almost anyone will play
this game under proper circumstances because of its time-structuring value,
careful study of individuals who particularly favor it reveals several
interesting features. First, they characteristically can and will play either
side of the game with equal facility. This switchability of roles is true of
all games. Players may habitually prefer one role to another, but they are
capable of trading, and they are willing to play any other role in the same
game, if for some reason that is indicated. (Compare, for example, the switch
from Drinker to Rescuer in the game of “Alcoholic.”)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, in clinical practice it is found that people who
favor YDYB belong to that class of patients who eventually request hypnosis or
some sort of hypnotic injection as a method of speeding up their treatment.
When they are playing the game, their object is to demonstrate that no one can
give them an acceptable suggestion—that is, they will never surrender: whereas
with the therapist, they request a procedure which will put them in a state of
complete surrender. It is thus apparent that YDYB represents a social solution
to a conflict about surrender.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even more specifically, this game is common among people who
have a fear of blushing, as die following therapeutic exchange demonstrates:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therapist: “Why do you play ‘Why Don’t You—Yes But’ if you
know it’s a con?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White: “If I’m talking to somebody I have to keep thinking
of thinos to say. If I don’t, I’ll blush. Except in the dark. I can’t stand a
lull. I know it, and my husband knows it, too. He’s always told me that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therapist: “You menn if your Adult doesn’t keep busy, your
Child takes the chance to pop up and make you feel embarrassed?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>White: “That’s it. So if I can keep making suggestions to
somebody, or get him to make suggestions to me, then I’m all right, I’m
protected. As long as I can keep my Adult in control, I can postpone  the
embarrassment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here White indicates clearly that she fears unstructured
time. Her Child is prevented from advertising as long as the Adult can be kept
busy in a social situation, and a game offers a suitable structure for Adult
functioning. But the game must be suitably motivated in order to maintain her
interest. Her choice of YDYB is influenced by the principle of economy: it
yields die maximum internal and external advantages to her Child’s conflicts
about physical passivity. She could play with equal zest either die shrewd
Child who cannot be dominated or the sage Parent who tries to dominate the
Child in someone else, but fails. Since the basic principle of YDYB is that no
suggestion is ever accepted, the Parent is never successful. The motto of the
game is: “Don’t get panicky, the Parent never succeeds.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, then: while each move is amusing, so to speak,
to White, and brings its own litde pleasure in rejecting the suggestion, the
real payoff is the silence or masked silence which ensues when all the others
have racked their brains and grown tired of trying to diink of acceptable
solutions. This signifies to White and to them that she has won by
demonstrating it is they who are inadequate. If the silence is not masked, it
may persist for several minutes. In the paradigm, Green cut White’s triumph
short because of her eagerness to start a game of her own, and that was what
kept her from participating in White’s game. Later on in the session, White demonstrated
her resentment against Green for having abridged her moment of victory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another curious feature of YDYB is that the external and internal
games are played exactly the same way, with die roles reversed. In the external
form, the one observed clinically, White’s Child comes out to play the role of
the inadequate helpseeker in a many-handed situation. In the internal form, the
more intimate two-handed game played at home with her husband, her Parent comes
out as the wise, efficient suggestion-giver, This reversal is usually
secondary, however, since during the courtship she plays the helpless Child
side, and only after the honeymoon is over does her bossy Parent begin to
emerge into the open. There may have been slips as the wedding approached, but
her fiance will overlook these in his eagerness to settle down with his
carefully chosen bride. If he does not overlook them, the engagement may be
called off for “good reasons,” and White, sadder but no wiser, will resume her
search for a suitable mate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. It is evident that those who respond to White’s
first move, the presentation of her “problem,” are playing a form of “I’m Only
Trying to Help You” (ITHY). In fact YDYB is the inverse of ITHY. In ITHY there
is one therapist and many clients: in YDYB one client and many “therapists.”
The clinical antithesis to YDYB, therefore, is not to play ITHY. If the opening
is of the form: “What do you do if ...” (WYDI), a suggested response is: “That
is a difficult problem. What are you going to do about it?” If it is of the
form: “X didn’t work out properly,” the response then should be “That is too
bad.” Both of these are polite enough to leave White at a loss, or at least to
elicit a crossed transaction, so that his frustration becomes manifest and can
then be explored. In a therapy group it is good practice for susceptible
patients to refrain from playing ITHY when invited. Then not only White, but
the other members as well, can learn from anti-YDYB, which is merely the other
side of anti-ITHY.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a social situation, if the game is friendly and harmless,
there is no reason not to participate. If it is an attempt to exploit professional
knowledge, an antithetical move may be required; but in such situations this
arouses resentment because of the exposure of White’s Child. The best policy
under those circumstances is to flee from the opening move and look for a stimulating
game of first-degree “Rapo.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relatives. “Why Don’t You—Yes But” must be distinguished
from its obverse, “Why Did You—No But” (YDNB), in which it is the Parent who
wins and the defensive Child who eventually retires in confusion, although
again the bare transcript may sound factual, rational and Adult to Adult. YDNB
is closely related to “Furthermore.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reverse of YDYB at first resembles “Peasant.” Here White
seduces the therapist into giving her suggestions which she immediately
accepts, rather than rejects. Only after he is deeply involved does he perceive
that White is aiming on him. What looked like “Peasant” ends up as a game of
intellectual “Rapo.” The classical version of this is the switch from positive
to negative transference in the course of orthodox psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>YDYB may also be played in a second-degree hard form as “Do
Me Something.” The patient refuses to do the housework, for example, and there
is a game of YDYB every evening when the husband returns home. But no matter
what he says, she sullenly refuses to change her ways. In some cases the
sullenness may be malignant and require careful psychiatric evaluation. The
game aspect must be considered as well, however, since it raises the question
of why the husband selected such a spouse, and how he contributes to
maintaining the situation.</p>

<h2>Chapter Nine. Sexual Games</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>SOME games are played to exploit or fight off sexual impulses.
These are all, in effect, perversions of the sexual instincts in which the
satisfaction is displaced from the sexual act to the crucial transactions which
constitute die payoff of the game. This cannot always be demonstrated
convincingly, because such games are usually played in privacy, so that
clinical information about them has to be obtained secondhand, and the
informant’s bias cannot always be satisfactorily evaluated. The psychiatric
conception of homosexuality, for example, is heavily skewed, because the more
aggressive and successful “players” do not often come for psychiatric
treatment, and die available material mostly concerns the passive partners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The games included here are: “Let’s You and Him Fight,” “Perversion,”
“Rapo,” “Stocking Game” and “Uproar,” In most cases, the agent is a woman. This
is because the hard forms of sexual games in which’ the man is the agent verge
on or constitute criminality, and properly belong in the Underworld section. On
the other side, sexual games and marital games overlap, but the ones described
here are readily available to unmarried people as well as to spouses.</p>

<h3>1. Let’s You And Him Fight </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This may be a maneuver, a ritual or a game. In each
case  the  psychology is essentially  feminine.  Because of its dramatic
qualities, LYAHF is the basis of much of the world’s literature, both good and
bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1, As a maneuver it is romantic. The woman maneuvers or
challenges two men into fighting, with the implication or promise that she will
surrender herself to the winner, After the competition is decided, she fulfills
her bargain. This is an honest transaction, and the presumption is that she and
her mate live happily ever after.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. As a ritual, it tends to be tragic. Custom demands that
the two men fight for her, even if she does not want them to, and even if she
has already made her choice. If the wrong man wins, she must nevertheless take
him. In this case it is society and not the woman who sets up LYAHF. If she is
willing, the transaction is an honest one. If she is unwilling or disappointed,
the outcome may offer her considerable scope for playing games, such as “Let’s
Pull A Fast One on Joey.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. As a game it is comic. The woman sets up the competition,
and while the two men are fighting, she decamps with a third. The internal and
external psychological advantages for her and her mate are derived from the
position that honest competition is for suckers, and the comic story they have
lived through forms the basis for the internal and external social advantages.</p>

<h3>2. Perversion</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. Heterosexual perversions such as fetishism, sadism
and masochism are symptomatic of a confused Child and are treated accordingly.
Their transactional aspects, however, as manifested m actual sexual situations,
can be dealt with by means of game analysis. This may lead to social control,
so that even if the warped sexual impulses remain unchanged, they are
neutralized as far as actual indulgence is concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People who are suffering from mild sadistic or masochistic
distortions tend to take a primitive kind of Mental Health position. They feel
that they are strongly sexed, and that prolonged abstinence will lead to
serious consequences. Neither of these conclusions is necessarily true, but
they form the basis for a game of “Wooden Leg” with the plea: “What do you expect
from someone as strongly sexed as I am?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. To extend ordinary courtesy to oneself and one’s
partner; dial is, to refrain from verbal or physical flagellation and confine
oneself to more conventional forms of coitus. If White is a true pervert, this
will lay bare the second element of the game, which is often clearly expressed
in his dreams: that coitus itself has little interest For him, and that his
real satisfaction is derived from the humiliating foreplay. This is something
that he may not have cared to admit to himself. But it will now become clear to
him that his complaint is: “After all this work, I have to have intercourse,
yet!” At this point the position is much more favorable for specific
psychotherapy, and much of the pleading and evasiveness has been nullified. This
applies to ordinary “sexual psychopaths” as seen in practice, and not to
malignant schizophrenic or criminal perversions, nor to those who confine their
sexual activities to fantasy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The game of “Homosexuality” has become elaborated into a
subculture in many countries, just as it is ritualized in others. Many of the
disabilities which result from homosexuality arise from making it into a game.
The provocative behavior which gives rise to “Cops and Robbers,” “Why Does This
Always Happen to Us,” “It’s the Society We Live In,” “AH Great Men Were” and so
forth, is often amenable to social control, which reduces the handicaps to a
minimum. The “professional homosexual” wastes a large amount of time and energy
which could be applied to other ends. Analysis of his games may help him
establish a quiet manage which will leave him free to enjoy the benefits that
bourgeois society offers, instead of devoting himself to playing his own
variation of “Ain’t It Awful!”</p>

<h3>3. Rapo</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is a game played between a man and a woman
which might more politely be called, in the milder forms at least, “Kiss Off”
or “Indignation.” It may be played with varying degrees of intensity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.  First-Degree “Rapo,” or “Kiss Off,” is popular at social
gatherings and consists essentially of mild flirtation. White signals that she
is available and gets her pleasure from the man’s pursuit. As soon as he has
committed himself, the game is over. If she is polite, she may say quite
frankly “I appreciate your compliments and thank you very much,” and move on to
the next conquest. If she is less generous, she may simply leave him. A
skillful player can make this game last for a long time at a large social
gathering by moving around frequently, so that the man has to carry out
complicated maneuvers in order to follow her without being too obvious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. In Second-Degree “Rapo,” or “Indignation,” White gets
only secondary satisfaction from Black’s advances. Her primary gratification
comes from rejecting him, so that this game is also colloquially known as “Buzz
Off, Buster.” She leads Black into a much more serious commitment than the mild
flirtation of First-Degree “Rapo” and enjoys watching his discomfiture when she
repulses him. Black, of course, is not as helpless as he seems, and may have
gone to considerable trouble to get himself involved. Usually he is playing
some variation of “Kick Me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Third-Degree “Rapo” is a vicious game which ends in murder,
suicide or the courtroom. Here White leads Black into compromising physical
contact and then claims that he has made a criminal assault or has done her
irreparable damage. In its most cynical form White may actually allow him to
complete the sexual act so that she gets that enjoyment before confronting him.
The confrontation may be immediate, as in the illegitimate cry of rape, or it
may be long delayed, as in suicide or homicide following a prolonged love
affair. If she chooses to play it as a criminal assault, she may have no
difficulty in finding mercenary or morbidly interested allies, such as the press,
the police, counselors and relatives. Sometimes, however, these outsiders may
cynically turn on her, so that she loses the initiative and becomes a tool in
their games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In   some   cases   outsiders   perform   a   different  
function.///They force the game on an unwilling White because they want to play
“Let’s You and Him Fight.” They put her in such a position that in order to
save her face or her reputation she has to cry rape. This is particularly apt
to happen with girls under the legal age of consent; they may be quite willing
to continue a liaison, but because it is discovered or made an issue of, they
feel constrained to turn the romance into a game of Third-Degree “Rapo.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In one well-known situation, the wary Joseph refused to be inveigled
into a game of “Rapo,” whereupon Potiphar’s wife made the classical switch into
“Let’s You and Him Fight,” an excellent example of the way a hard player reacts
to antithesis, and of the dangers that beset people who refuse to play games,
These two games are combined in the well-known “Badger Game,” in which the
woman seduces Black and then cries rape, at which point her husband takes
charge and abuses Black for purposes of blackmail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the most unfortunate and acute forms of Third-Degree “Rapo”
occurs relatively frequently between homosexual strangers, who in a matter of
an hour or so may bring the game to a point of homicide. The cynical and
criminal variations of this game contribute a large volume to sensational
newspaper copy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The childhood prototype of “Rapo” is the same as that of “Frigid
Woman,” in which the little girl induces the boy to humiliate himself or get
dirty and then sneers at him, as classically described by Maugham in Of Hitman
Bondage and, as already noted, by Dickens in Great Expectations. This is Second
Degree. A harder form, approaching Third Degree, may be played in tough
neighborhoods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The man’s ability to avoid becoming involved in
this game or to keep it under control depends on his capacity to distinguish
genuine expressions of feeling from moves in the game. If he is thus able to
exert social control, he may obtain a great deal of pleasure from the mild
flirtations of “Kiss Off.” On the other hand it is difficult to conceive of a
safe antithesis for the Potiphar’s Wife maneuver, other than checking out
before closing time with no forwarding address. In 1938 the writer met an aging
Joseph in Aleppo who had checked out of Constantinople thirty-two years
previously, after one of the Sultan’s ladies had cornered him during a business
visit to the Yildiz harem. He had to abandon his shop, but took time to pick up
his hoard of gold francs, and had never returned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relatives. The male versions of “Rapo” are notoriously found
in commercial situations: “Casting Couch” (and then she didn’t get the part)
and “Cuddle Up” (and then she got fired).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ANALYSIS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following analysis refers to Third-Degree “Rapo” because
there the elements of the game are more dramatically illustrated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aim: Malicious revenge. Roles:  Seductress, Wolf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dynamics (Third Degree): Penis envy, oral violence. “Kiss
Off” is phallic, while “Indignation” has strong anal elements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examples: (1) I’ll tell on you, you dirty little boy. (2)
Wronged woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult (male):   “I’m sorry if I went further than you
intended me to.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult (female) “You have violated me and must pay the full
penalty.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psychological Paradigm: Child-Child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Child (male): “See how irresistible I am.” Child 
(female):   “Now I’ve  got  you,  you  son of a bitch.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moves: (1) Female: seduction; Male: counter-seduction. (2)
Female: surrender; Male: victory. (3) Female: confrontation; Male: collapse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advantages:   (1)    Internal   Psychological—expression   of
hatred and projection of guilt. (2) External Psychological-avoidance of
emotional sexual intimacy. (3) Internal Social—”Now I’ve Got You, You Son of a
Bitch.” (4) External Social-”Ain’t It Awful,” “Courtroom,” “Let’s You and Him
Fight.” (5) Biological—sexual and belligerent exchanges. (6) Existential-I am
blameless.</p>

<h3>4. The Stocking Game</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is a game of the “Rapo” family; in it the most
obvious characteristic is the exhibitionism, which is hysterical in nature. A
woman comes into a strange group and after a very short time raises her leg,
exposing herself in a provocative way, and remarks, “Oh my, I have a run in my
stocking.” This is calculated to arouse the men sexually and to make the other
women angry. Any confrontation of White is met, of course, with protestations
of innocence or counter-accusations, hence the resemblance to classical “Rapo.”
What is significant is White’s lack of adaptation. She seldom waits to find out
what kind of people she is dealing with or how to time her maneuver. Hence it
stands out as inappropriate and affects her relationships with her associates.
In spite of some superficial “sophistication,” she fails to understand what
happens to her in life because her judgment of human nature is too cynical. The
aim is to prove that other people have lascivious minds, and her Adult is
conned by her Child and her Parent (usually a lascivious mother) into ignoring
both her own provocative-ness and the good sense of many of the people she
meets. Thus the game tends to be self-destructive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is probably a phallic variant of a game whose content depends
on the underlying disturbance. An “oral” variant may be exhibited by women with
deeper pathology and well-developed breasts. Such women often sit with their
hands behind their heads so as to thrust their breasts forward; they may draw
additional attention to them by remarking about their size or some pathology
such as an operation or a lump. Some types of squirming probably constitute an
anal variant. The implication of this game is that the woman is sexually
available. Thus it may be played in a more symbolic form by bereaved women who “exhibit”
their widowhood insincerely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. Along with the poor adaptation, these women show
little tolerance for antithesis. If the game is ignored or countered by a
sophisticated therapy group, for example, they may not return. Antithesis must
be carefully distinguished in this game from reprisal, since the latter
signifies that White has won. Women are more skillful at counter-moves in “Stocking
Game” than men, who indeed have little incentive to break up this game.
Antithesis, therefore, is best left to the discretion of the other women
present.</p>

<h3>5. Uproar</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. The classical game is played between domineering fathers
and teen-age daughters, where there is a sexually inhibited mother. Father
comes home from work and finds fault with daughter, who answers impudently; or
daughter may make the first move by being impudent, whereupon father finds
Fault. Their voices rise, and the clash becomes more acute. The outcome depends
on who has the initiative. There are three possibilities; (a) father retires to
his bedroom and slams the door (b) daughter retires to her bedroom and slams
the door (c) both retire to their respective bedrooms and slam the doors. In
any case, the end of a game of “Uproar” is marked by a slamming door. “Uproar”
offers a distressing but effective solution to the sexual problems that arise
between fathers and teen-age daughters in certain households. Often they can
only live in the same house together if they are angry at each other, and the
slamming doors emphasize for each of them the fact that they have separate
bedrooms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In degenerate households this game may be played in a
sinister and repellent form in which father waits up for daughter whenever she
goes out on a date, and examines her and her clodiing carefully on her return
to make sure that she has not had intercourse. The slightest suspicious
circumstance may give rise to the most violent altercation, which may end with
the daughter being expelled from the house in the middle of the night. In the
long run nature will take its course—if not that night then the next, or the
one after. Then the father’s suspicions are “justified,” as he makes plain to
the mother, who has stood by “helplessly” while all this went on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In general, however, “Uproar” may be played between any two
people who are trying to avoid sexual intimacy. For example, it is a common
terminal phase of “Frigid Woman.” It is relatively rare between teen-age boys
and their female relatives, because it is easier for teen-age boys to escape
from the house in the evening than for other members of the family. At an
earlier age brothers and sisters can set up effective barriers and partial
satisfactions through physical combat, a pattern which has various motivations
at different ages, and which in America is a semi-ritualistic form of “Uproar”
sanctioned by television, pedagogic and pediatric authorities. In upper-class
England it is Cor was) considered bad form, and the corresponding energies are
channeled into the well-regulated “Uproar” of the playing fields.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The game is not as distasteful to the father as
he might like to think, and it is generally the daughter who makes the
antithetical move through an early, often premature or forced marriage. If jt
is psychologically possible, the mother can make the antithetical move by
relinquishing her relative or absolute frigidity. The game may subside if the
father finds an outside sexual interest, but that may lead to other
complications. In die case of married couples, the antitheses are the same as
for “Frigid Woman” or “Frigid Man.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under appropriate circumstances “Uproar” leads quite naturally
into “Courtroom.”</p>

<h2>Chapter Ten. Underworld Games</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>WITH the infiltration of the “helping” professions into the
courts, probation departments and correctional facilities, and with the
increasing sophistication o£ criminologists and law enforcement officers, those
concerned should be aware of the more common games prevalent in the underworld,
both jn prison and out of it. These include “Cops and Robbers,” “How Do You Get
Out of Here” and “Let’s Pull a Fast One on Joey.”</p>

<h3>1. Cops And Robbers</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. Because many criminals are cop-haters, they seem to
get as much satisfaction from outwitting the police as from their criminal
gains, often more. Their crimes, at the Adult level, are games played for the
material rewards, the take; but at the Child level it is the thrill of the
chase: the getaway and the cool-off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Curiously enough, the childhood prototype of “Cops and Robbers”
is not cops and robbers but hide-and-seek, in which the essential element is
the chagrin of being found. Younger children readily betray this. If father
finds them too easily, the chagrin is there without much fun. But father, if he
is a good player, knows what to do; he holds off, whereupon the little boy
gives him a clue by calling out, dropping something or banging. Thus he forces
father to find him, but still shows chagrin; this time he has had more fun
because of the increased suspense. If father gives up, the boy usually feels
disappointed rather than victorious. Since the fun of being hidden was there,
evidently that is not where the trouble lies, What he is disappointed about is
not being caught. When his turn comes to hide, father knows he is not supposed
to outwit the little boy for very lone jus* lonS enough to make it fun; and he
is wise enough to look chagrined when he is caught. It soon becomes clear that
being found is the necessary payoff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence hide-and-seek is not a mere pastime but a true game At
the social level it is a battle of wits, and is most satisfying when the Adult
of each player does his best; at the psychological level, however, it is set up
like compulsive gambling, in which White’s Adult has to lose in order for his
Child to win. Not being caught is actually the antithesis. Among older children,
one who finds an insoluble hiding place is regarded as not being a good sport,
since he has spoiled the game, He has eliminated the Child element and turned
the whole thing into an Adult procedure. He is no longer playing for fun. He is
in the same class as the owner of a casino, or some professional criminals, who
are really out for money rather than sport.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There seern to be two distinctive types of habitual
criminals: those who are in crime primarily for profit, and those who are in it
primarily for the game—with a large group in between who can handle it either
way. The “compulsive winner,” the big money-maker whose Child really does not
want to be caught, rarely is, according to reports; he is an untouchable, for
whom the fix is always in. The “compulsive loser,” on the other hand, who is
playing “Cops and Robbers” (C&amp;R), seldom does very well financially. The
exceptions to this often seem to be due to luck rather than skill; in the long
run even the lucky ones usually end up as their Child requires, squawking
rather than riding high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The C&amp;R player, with whom we are concerned here, in some
ways resembles, the Alcoholic. He can shift roles from Robber to Cop and from’
Cop to Robber. In some cases he may play the Parental Cop during the day and
the Child Robber after dark. There is a Cop in many Robbers, and a Robber in
many Cops. If the criminal “reforms,” he may play the role of Rescuer, becoming
a social worker or a mission worker; but the Rescuer is Far less important in
this game than in “Alcoholic.” Ordinarily, however, the player’s role as Robber
is his destiny, and each has his own modus operandi for getting caught. He may
make it tough or easy for the Cops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The situation is similar with gamblers. At the social or
sociological level a “professional” gambler is one whose chief interest in life
is gambling. But at the psychological level there are two different kinds of
people who are professional gamblers. There are those who spend their time
gaming, i.e., playing with Fate, in whom the strengdi of the Adult’s desire to
win is exceeded only by the strength of the Child’s need to lose. Then there
are those who run gambling houses and actually do earn a living, usually a very
good one, by providing opportunities for gamesters to play; they themselves are
not playing, and try to avoid playing, although occasionally under certain
conditions they will indulge themselves and enjoy it, just as a straight criminal
may occasionally play a game of C&amp;R,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This throws light on why sociological and psychological studies
of criminals have been generally ambiguous and unproductive: they are dealing
with two different kinds of people who cannot be adequately differentiated in
the ordinary theoretical or empirical frameworks. The same is true in studying
gamblers. Transactional and game analyses offer an immediate solution for this.
They remove the ambiguity by distinguishing transactionally, below the social
level, between “players” and “straight professionals.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us now turn from this general thesis to consider
specific examples. Some burglars do their jobs without any waste motion. The “Cops
and Robbers” burglar leaves his calling card in gratuitous acts of vandalism,
such as spoiling valuable clothing with secretions and excretions. The straight
bank robber, according to reports, takes every possible precaution to avoid
violence; the C&amp;R bank robber is only looking for an excuse to vent his
anger. Like any professional, a straight criminal likes his jobs to be as clean
as circumstances permit. The C&amp;R criminal is compelled to blow off steam in
the course of his work. The true professional is said never to operate until
the fix is in; the player is willing to take on the law barehanded. Straight
professionals are well aware, in their own way, of the game of C&amp;R. If a
gang member shows too much interest in the game, to the point of jeopardizing
the job, and particularly if his need to be caught begins to show, they will
take drastic measures to prevent a recurrence. Perhaps it is just because
straight professionals are not playing C&amp;R that they are so seldom caught,
and hence so rarely studied sociologically, psychologically and
psychiatrically; and this also applies to gamblers. Hence most of our clinical
knowledge about criminals and gamblers refers to players rather than to
straight professionals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kleptomaniacs (as opposed to professional shoplifters) are examples
of how widely trivial C&amp;R is played. It is probable that a very large
percentage of Occidentals, at least, have played C&amp;R in fantasy, and that
is what sells newspapers in our half of the world. This fantasy frequently
occurs in the form of dreaming up the “perfect murder,” which is playing the
hardest possible game and completely outwitting the cops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Variations of C&amp;R are “Auditors and Robbers,” played by
embezzlers with the same rules and the same payoff; Customs and Robbers,”
played by smugglers; etc. Of special interest is the criminal variation of “Courtroom.”
Despite all his precautions, the professional may occasionally be arrested and
brought to trial. For him “Courtroom” is a procedure, which he carries out
according to the instructions of his legal advisers. For the lawyers, if they
are compulsive winners, “Courtroom” is essentially a game played with the jury
in which the object is to win, not lose, and this is regarded as a constructive
game by a large segment of society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. This is the concern of qualified criminologists
rather than psychiatrists. The police and judiciary apparatus are not
antithetical, but are playing their roles in the game under the ruies set up by
society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One thing should be emphasized, however. Research workers in
criminology may joke that some criminals behave as though they enjoyed the
chase and ‘wanted to be caught, or they may read the idea and agree in a
deferential way. But they show little tendency to consider such an “academic”
factor as decisive in their “serious” work. For one thing, there is no way to
unmask this element through the standard methods of psychological research. The
investigator must therefore either overlook a crucial point because he cannot
work it with his research tools, or else change his tools. The fact is that
those tools have so far not yielded one single solution to any problem in
criminology. Researchers might therefore be better off discarding the old
methods and tackling the problem freshly. Until C&amp;R is accepted not merely
as an interesting anomaly, but as the very heart of the matter in a significant
percentage of cases, much research in criminology will continue to deal with
trivialities, doctrines, peripheral issues or irrelevancies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ANALYSIS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis: See if you can catch me. Aim: Reassurance. Roles: 
Robber, Cop  (Judge).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dynamics: Phallic intrusion, e.g. (1) Hide-and-seek, tag.
(2) Crime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Social Paradigm: Parent-Child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Child:   “See if you can catch me.” Parent: “That’s my job.”
Psychological Paradigm: Parent-Child. Child:  “You must catch me.” Parent: “Aha,
there you are.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moves: (1) W:Defiance. B:Indignation. (2) W:Con-cealment.
B:Frustration. (3) W:Provocation. B:Victory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—material indemnification
for old wrong. (2) External Psychological—coun-terphobic. (3) Internal
Social—See if you can catch me.///(4) External Social-I almost got away with
it. (Pastime: They almost got away with it.) (5) Biological-notoriety. (6)
Existential: I’ve always been a loser,</p>

<h3>2. How Do You Get Out Of Here</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. The historical evidence is that those prisoners
survive best who have their time structured by an activity, a pastime or a
game. This is apparently well known to political police, who are said to break
some prisoners down simply by keeping them inactive and in a state of social
deprivation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The favored activity of solitary prisoners is reading or
writing books, and the favored pastime is escape, some of whose practitioners,
such as Casanova and Baron Trenck, have become famous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The favored game is “How Do You Get Out of Here1?” (“Want
Out”), which may also be played in state hospitals. It must be distinguished
from the operation (see p. 48) of the same name, known as “Good Behavior.” An
inmate who really wants to be free will find out how to comply with the
authorities so as to be released at the earliest possible moment. Nowadays this
may often be accomplished by playing a good game of “Psychiatry,” Group Therapy
Type. The game of “Want Out,” however, is played by inmates or by patients
whose Child does not want to get out. They simulate “Good Behavior,” but at the
critical point they sabotage themselves so as not to be released. Thus in “Good
Behavior” Parent, Adult and Child work together to be discharged; in “Want Out”
Parent and Adult go through the prescribed motions until the critical moment,
when the Child, who is actually frightened at the prospect of venturing into the
uncertain world, takes over and spoils the effect. “Want Out” was common in the
late I930’s among recently arrived immigrants from Germany who became
psychotic. They would improve and beg for release from the hospital; but as the
day of liberation approached, their psychotic manifestations would recur.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis.  Both “Good Behavior” and “Want Out” are recognized
by alert administrators and can be dealt with at die executive level. Beginners
in group therapy, however, are often taken in. A competent group therapist,
knowing these are die most frequent manipulations in psychiatrically oriented
prisons, will be watching for them and will ferret them out at an early phase.
Since “Good Behavior” is an honest operation, it may be treated as such, and
there is no harm in discussing it openly. “Want Out,” on the other hand,
requires active therapy if the frightened inmate is to be rehabilitated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relatives. A close relative of “Want Out” is an operation
called “You’ve Got to Listen.” Here the inmate of an institution or the client
of a social agency demands the right to make complaints. The complaints are
often irrelevant. His main purpose is to assure himself that he will be
listened to by the authorities. If they make the mistake of thinking that he
expects the complaints to be acted on and cut him off as too demanding, there
may be trouble. If they accede to his demands, he will increase them. If diey
merely listen patiently and with signs of interest, the “Got to Listen” player
will be satisfied and cooperative, and will not ask for anything more. The
administrator must learn to distinguish “You’ve Got to Listen” from serious demands
for remedial action.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bum Rap” is another game that belongs in this family. A
straight criminal may holler “Bum Rap” in a real effort to get out, in which
case it is part of the procedure. The inmate who plays “Bum Rap” as a game,
however, does not use it effectively to try to get out, since if he gets out be
will no longer have much excuse to holler.</p>

<h3>3. Let’s Pull A Fast One On Joey </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. The prototype of this game is “The Big Store,” die
big-time confidence game, but many small gifts and even the badger game are
FOOJY. No man can be beaten at FOOJY unless he has larceny in his veins,
because the first move is for Black to tell White that dumb-honest-old—///Joey
is just waiting to be taken. If White were completely honest, he would either
back off or warn Joey, but he doesn’t. Just as Joey is about to pay off,
something goes wrong, and White finds that his investment is gone. Or in the
badger game, just as Joey is about to be cuckolded, he happens to walk in. Then
White, who was playing his own rules in his own honest way, finds that he has
to play Joey’s rules, and they hurt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Curiously enough, the mark is supposed to know the rules of
FOOJY and stick to them. Honest squawking is a calculated risk of the con mob;
they will not hold that against White, and he is even allowed a certain
latitude in lying to the police to save his face. But if he goes too far and
accuses them falsely of burglary, for example, that is cheating, and they
resent it. On the other hand, diere is little sympathy for a con man who gets
into trouble by working a mark who is drunk, since diis is improper procedure,
and be should know better. The same applies if he is stupid enough to pick a
mark with a sense of humor, since it is well known that such people cannot be
trusted to play the straight man in FOOJY all the way down the line through the
terminal game of “Cops and Robbers.” Experienced con men are scared of marks
who laugh after they have been taken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It should be noted that a practical joke is not a game of
FOOJY, because in a practical joke Joey is the one who suffers, while in FOOJY
Joey comes out on top, and White is the one who suffers. A practical joke is a
pastime, while FOOJY is a game in wbich the joke is arranged to backfire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is evident that FOOJY is a three—or four-handed game,
with the police playing the fourth hand, and that it is related to “Let’s You
and Him Fight.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thanks are due to Dr. Franklin Emst of the California
Medical Facility at Vacaville, Mr. William CollJns of the California Rehabilitation
Center at Norco, and Mr. Laurence Means of the California Institution for Men
at Tehachapi, for their continued interest in studying the game of “Cops and
Robbers” and for their helpful discussions and criticisms.</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Frederick Wiseman, in “Psychiatry and the Law: Use and
Abuse of Psychiatry in a Murder Case” {American Journal of Psychiatry. 118:
289-299, 1961) gives a clear and tragic example of a hard form of “Cops and
Robbers.” It concerns a 23-year-old man who shot his fiancee and then turned
himself in. This was not easy to arrange, since the police did not believe his
story until he had repeated it four times. Later, he said: “It just seemed to
me that all my life I was bound to end up in the chair. If that was the way it
was, that was the way it would be.” The author says it was farcical to expect a
lay jury to understand the complex psychiatric testimony that was offered at
the trial in technical jargon. In game terms, the central issue can be stated
in words of no more than two syllables: A nine-year-old boy decides (tor
reasons clearly brought out at the trial) that he is bound to end up in the
chair. He spends the rest of his life headed toward this goal, and using his
girl friend as a target, in the end he sets himself up.</p>

<h2>Chapter Eleven. Consulting Room Games</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>GAMES that are tenaciously played in the therapeutic
situation are the most important ones for the professional game analyst to be
aware of. They can be most readily studied first-hand in the consulting room.
There are three types, according to the role of the agent:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Games played by therapists and case workers: “I’m Only
Trying to Help You” and “Psychiatry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Games played by professionally trained people who ate patients
in therapy groups, such as “Greenhouse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Games played by lay patients and clients: “Indigence,” “Peasant,”
“Stupid” and “Wooden Leg.”</p>

<h3>1. Greenhouse</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is a variation of “Psychiatry,” which is played
hardest by young social scientists, such as clinical psychologists. In the
company of their colleagues these young people tend to play “Psychoanalysis,”
often in a jocular way, using such expressions as “Your hostility is showing”
or “How mechanical can a defense mechanism get?” This is usually a harmless and
enjoyable pastime; it is a normal phase of their learning experience, and with
a few originals in the group it can become quite amusing. (This writer’s
preference is, “I see National Parapraxis Week is here again.”) As patients in
psychotherapy groups some of these people are apt to indulge in this mutual
critique more seriously; but since it is not highly productive in that situation,
it may have to be headed off by the therapist. The proceedings may then turn
into a game of “Greenhouse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I here is a strong tendency for recent graduates to have an
exaggerated respect for what they call “Genuine Feelings.” The expression of
such a feeling may be preceded by an announcement that it is on its way. After
the announcement, the feeling is described, or rather presented before die
group, as though it were a rare flower which should be regarded with awe. The
reactions of die other members are received very solemnly, and they take on the
air of connoisseurs at a botanical garden. The problem seems to be, in the
jargon of game analysis, whether this one is good enough to be exhibited in the
National Feeling Show. A questioning intervention by the therapist may be
strongly resented, as though be were some clumsy-fingered clod mauling the
fragile petals of an exotic century plant. The therapist, naturally, feels that
in order to understand the anatomy and physiology of a flower, it may be necessary
to dissect it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The antithesis, which is crucial for therapeutic
progress, is the irony of the above description. If this game is allowed to
proceed, it may go on unchanged for years, after which the patient may feel
that he has had a “therapeutic experience” during which he has “expressed
hostility” and learned to “face feelings” in a way which gives him an advantage
over less fortunate colleagues. Meanwhile very little of dynamic significance
may have happened, and certainly the investment of time has not been used to
maximum therapeutic advantage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The irony in the initial description is directed not against
the patients but against their teachers and the cultural milieu which
encourages such over-fastidiousness. If properly timed, a skeptical remark may
successfully divorce them from foppish Parental influences and lead to a less
self-conscious robustness in their transactions with each other. Instead of
cultivating feelings in a kind of hothouse atmosphere, Uiey may just let them
grow naturally, to be plucked when they are ripe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most obvious advantage of this game is the external psychological,
since it avoids intimacy by setting up special conditions   under   which  
feelings   may   be   expressed,   and special restrictions on the responses of
diose present.</p>

<h3>2. I’m Only Trying To Help You </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This game may be played in any professional
situation and is not confined to psychotherapists and welfare workers. However,
it is found most commonly and in its most florid form among social workers with
a certain type of training. The analysis of diis game was clarified for the
writer under curious circumstances. All the players at a poker game had folded
except two, a research psychologist and a businessman. The businessman, who had
a high hand, bet; the psychologist, who had an unbeatable one, raised. The
businessman looked puzzled, whereupon the psychologist remarked facetiously: “Don’t
be upset, I’m only trying to help you!” The businessman hesitated, and finally
put in bis chips. The psychologist showed the winning band, whereupon the other
threw down his cards in disgust. The others present then felt free to laugh at
the psychologist’s joke, and the loser remarked ruefully: “Yuu sure were
helpful!” The psychologist cast a knowing glance at the writer, implying that
the joke had really been made at the expense of the psychiatric profession. It
was at that moment that the structure of this game became clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The worker or therapist, of whatever profession, gives some
advice to a client or patient. The patient returns and reports that the
suggestion did not have the desired effect. The worker shrugs off this failure
with a feeling of resignation, and tries again. If be is more watchful, he may
detect at this point a twinge of frustration, but he will try again anyway.
Usually he feels little need to question his own motives, because he knows diat
many of his similarly trained colleagues do the same thing, and that he is
following the “correct” procedure and will receive full support from his supervisors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If he runs up against a hard player, such as a hostile obsessional,
he will find it more and more difficult to avoid feeling inadequate. Then he is
in trouble, and the situation will slowly deteriorate. In the worst case, he
may come up against an angry paranoid who will rush in one day in a rage,
crying: “Look what you made me do!” Then his frustration will come strongly to
the fore in the spoken or unspoken thought: “But I was only trying to help you!”
His bewilderment at the ingratitude may cause him considerable suffering,
indicating the complex motives underlying his own behavior. This bewilderment
is the payoff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Legitimate helpers should not be confused with people who
play “I’m Only Trying to Help You” (ITHY). “1 think we can do something about
it.” “I know what to do,” “I was assigned to help you” or “My fee for helping
you will be ....” are different from “I’m only trying to help you.” The first
four, in good faith, represent Adult offers to put professional qualifications
at the disposal of the distressed patient or client; ITHY has an ulterior
motive which is more important than professional skill in determining the
outcome. This motive is based on the position that people are ungrateful and
disappointing. The prospect of success is alarming to the Parent of the
professional and is an invitation to sabotage, because success would threaten
the position. The ITHY player needs to be reassured that help will not be
accepted no matter how strenuously it is offered. The client responds with “Look
How Hard I’m Trying” or “There’s Nothing You Can Do to Help Me.” More flexible
players can compromise: it is all right for people to accept help providing it
takes diem a long time to do so. Hence therapists tend to feel apologetic for a
quick result, since they know that some of their colleagues at staff meetings
will be critical. At the opposite pole from hard ITHY players, such as are
found among social workers, are good lawyers who help their clients without
personal involvement or sentimentality. Here craftsmanship takes the place of
covert strenuousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some schools of social work seem to be primarily academies
for the training of professional ITHY players, and it is not easy for their
graduates to desist from playing it. An example which may help to illustrate
some of the foregoing points will be found in the description of the complementary
game “Indigence.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ITHY and its variants are easy to find in everyday life. It
is played by family friends and relatives (e.g., “I Can Get It For You
Wholesale”), and by adults who do community work with children. It is a
favorite among parents, and the complementary game played by the offspring is
usually “Look What You Made Me Do.” Socially it may be a variant of “Schlemiel”
in which the damage is done while being helpful rather than impulsively; here
the client is represented by a victim who may be playing “Why Does This Always
Happen To Me?” or one of its variants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. There are several devices available for the
professional to handle an invitation to play this game, and his selection will
depend on the state of the relationship between himself and the patient,
particularly on the attitude of the patient’s Child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. The classical psychoanalytic antithesis is the most
thoroughgoing and the most difficult for the patient to tolerate. The invitation
is completely ignored. The patient then tries harder and harder. Eventually he
falls into a state of despair, manifested by anger or depression, which is the
characteristic sign that a game has been frustrated. This situation may lead to
a useful confrontation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. A more gentle (but not prim) confrontation may be attempted
on the first invitation. The therapist states that he is the patient’s
therapist and not his manager.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. An even more gentle procedure is to introduce the patient
into a therapy group, and let the other patients handle it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. With an acutely disturbed patient it may be necessary to
play along during the initial phase. These patients should be treated by a
psychiatrist, who being a medical man, can prescribe both medications and some
of the hygienic measures which are still valuable, even in this day of
tranquilizers, in the treatment of such people. If the physician prescribes a
hygienic regimen, which may include baths, exercise, rest periods, and regular
meals along with medication, the patient (1) carries out the regimen and feels
better C2) carries out the regimen scrupulously and complains that it does not
help (3) mentions casually that he forgot to carry out the instructions or that
he has abandoned the regimen because it was not doing any good. In the second
and third case it is then up to the psychiatrist to decide whether the patient
is amenable to game analysis at that point, or whether some other form of
treatment is indicated to prepare him for later psychotherapy. The relationship
between the adequacy of die regimen and the patient’s tendency to play games
with it should be carefully evaluated by the psychiatrist before he decides how
to proceed next.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the patient, on the other hand, the antithesis is, “Don’t
tell me what to do to help myself, I’ll tell you what to do to help me.” If the
therapist is known to be a Schlemiel, the correct antithesis for the patient to
use is, “Don’t help me, help him.” But serious players of “I’m Only Trying to
Help You” are generally lacking in a sense of humor. Antithetical moves on the
part of a patient are usually unfavorably received, and may result in the
therapist’s lifelong enmity. In everyday life such moves should not be
initiated unless one is prepared to carry them through ruthlessly and take the
consequences. For example, spuming a relative who “Can Get It For You Wholesale”
may cause serious domestic complications.</p>

<h3>3. Indigence</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. The thesis of this game is best stated by Henry
Miller in The Colossus of Maroussi: “The event must have taken place during the
year when I was looking for a job without the slightest intention of taking
one. It reminded me that, desperate as I thought myself to be, I bad not even
bothered to look through the columns of the want ads.” This game is one of the
complements of “I’m Only Trying to Help You” CITHY) as it is played by social
workers who earn their living by it, “Indigence” is played just as professionally
by the client who earns his living in this manner. The writer’s own experience
with “Indigence” is limited, but the following account by one of his most
accomplished students illustrates the nature of this game and its place in our
society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Miss Black was a social worker in a welfare agency whose
avowed purpose, for which it received a government subsidy, was the economic
rehabilitation of indigents—which in effect meant getting them to find and
retain gainful employment. The clients of this agency were continually making
progress,” according to official reports, but very Few of them were actually “rehabilitated.”
This was understandable, it was claimed, because most of them had been welfare
clients for several years, going from agency to agency and sometimes being
involved with five or s&amp; agencies at a time, so that it was evident that
they were “difficult cases.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Miss Black, from her training in game analysis, soon
realized that the staff of her agency was playing a consistent game of ITHY,
and wondered how the clients were responding to this. In order to check, she
asked her own clients from week to week how many job opportunities they had
actually investigated. She was interested to discover that although they were
theoretically supposed to be looking assiduously for work from day to day,
actually they devoted very little effort to this, and sometimes the token
efforts they did make had an ironic quality. For example, one man said that he
answered at least one advertisement a day looking for work. “What kind of work?”
she inquired. He said he wanted to go into sales work. “Is that the only kind
of ad you answer?” she asked. He—said that it was, but it was too bad that—he
was a stutterer, as that held him back from his chosen career. About this time
it came to the attention of her supervisor that she was asking these questions,
and she was reprimanded for putting “undue pressure” on her clients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Miss Black decided nevertheless to go ahead and rehabilitate
some of them. She selected those who were able-bodied and did not seem to have
a valid reason to continue to receive welfare funds. With this selected group,
she talked over the games ITHY and “Indigence.” When they were willing to
concede the point, she said that unless they found jobs she was going to cut
them off from welfare funds and refer them to a different kind of agency.
Several of them almost immediately found employment, some for the first time in
years. But they were indignant at her attitude, and some of them wrote letters
to her supervisor complaining about it. The supervisor called her in and
reprimanded her even more severely, on the ground that although her former
clients were working, they were not “really rehabilitated.” The supervisor
indicated that there was some question whether they would retain Miss Black in
the agency. Miss Black, as much as she dared without further jeopardizing her
position, tactfully tried to elicit what would constitute “really rehabilitated”
in the agency’s opinion. This was not clarified. She was only told that she was
“putting undue pressure” on people, and the fact that they were supporting
their families for the first time in years was in no way to her credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because she needed her job and was now in danger ofJoslng
it, some of her friends tried to help. The respected head of a psychiatric
clinic wrote to the supervisor, stating that he had heard Miss Black had done
some particularly effective work with welfare clients, and asking whether she
might discuss her findings at a staff conference at his clinic. The supervisor
refused permission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case the rules of “Indigence” were set up by the
agency to complement the local rules of ITHY. There was a tacit agreement
between the worker and the client which read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>W. “I’ll try to help you (providing you don’t get better).”
C. “I’ll look for employment (providing I don’t have to find any).”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a client broke the agreement by getting better, the
agency lost a client, and the client lost his welfare benefits, and both felt
penalized. If a worker like Miss Black broke the agreement by making the client
actually find work, the agency was penalized by the client’s complaints, which
might come to the attention of higher authorities, while again the client lost
his welfare benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As long as both obeyed the implicit rules, both got what
they wanted. The client received his benefits and soon learned what the agency
wanted in return: an opportunity to “reach out” (as part of ITHY) plus “clinical
mat^ai” (to present at “client-centered” staff conferences).///The client was
glad to comply with these demands, which gave him as much pleasure as it did
the agency. Thus they got along well together, and neither felt any desire to
terminate such a satisfying relationship. Miss Black, in effect, “reached in”
instead of “reaching out,” and proposed a “community-centered” staff conference
instead of a “client-centered” one; and this disturbed all the others concerned
in spite of the fact that she was thus only complying with the stated intent of
the regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two things should be noted here. First, “Indigence” as a
game rather than a condition due to physical, mental, or economic disability,
is played by only a limited percentage of welfare clients. Second, it will only
be supported by social workers who are trained to play ITHY. It will not be
well-tolerated by other workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allied games are “Veteran” and “Clinic.” “Veteran” displays
the same symbiotic relationship, this time between the Veterans Administration,
allied organizations, and a certain number of “professional veterans” who share
die legitimate privileges of disabled ex-servicemen. “Clinic” is played by a
certain percentage of those who attend the out-patient departments of large
hospitals. Unlike those who play “Indigent” or “Veteran,” patients who—play “Clinic”
do not receive financial remuneration, but get other advantages. They serve a
useful social purpose, since they are willing to cooperate in the training of
medical personnel and in studies of disease processes. From this they may get a
legitimate Adult satisfaction not available to players of “Indigence” and “Veteran.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. Antithesis, if indicated, consists in
withholding the benefits. Here the risk is not primarily from the player himself,
as in most other games, but from this game being culturally syntonic and
fostered by the complementary ITHY players. The threat comes from professional
colleagues and the aroused public, government agencies and protective unions.
The complaints which follow an exhibition of anti-”Indigence” may lead to a
loud outcry of “Yes, Yes, How About That?” which may be regarded as a healthy,
constructive operation or pastime, even if it occasionally discourages
candidness. In fact, the whole American political system of democratic freedoms
is based on a license (not available under many other forms of government) to
ask that question. Without such a license, humanitarian social progress becomes
seriously impeded.</p>

<h3>4. Peasant</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. The prototype peasant is the arthritic Bulgarian
villager who sells her only cow to raise money to go to the university clinic
in Sofia. There the professor examines her and finds her case so interesting
that he presents her in a clinical demonstration to the medical students. He
outlines not only the pathology, symptoms and diagnosis, but also the treatment.
This procedure fills Her with awe. Before she leaves, the professor gives her a
prescription and explains the treatment in more detail. She is overcome with
admiration for his learning and says the Bulgarian equivalent of, “Gee, you’re
wonderful, Professor!” However, she never has the prescription filled. First,
there is no apothecary in her village; second, even if there were, she would
never let such a valuable piece of paper out of her hands. Nor does she have
the facilities for carrying out the rest of the treatment, such as diet,
hydrotherapy and so on. She lives on, crippled as before, but happy now because
she can tell everyone about the wonderful treatment prescribed for her by the
great professor in Sofia, to whom she expresses her gratitude every night in
her prayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Years later, the Professor, in an unhappy frame of mind, happens
to pass through the village on his way to see a wealthy but demanding patient.
He remembers the peasant when she rushes out to kiss his hand and remind him of
the marvelous regimen he put her on so long ago. He accepts her homage
graciously, and is particularly gratified when she tells him how much good the
treatment has done. In fact he is so carried away that he fails to notice that
she limps as badly as ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Socially “Peasant”  is played in  an innocent and a dissembled
form, both with the motto, “Gee you’re wonderful, Mr. Murgatroyd!” (GYWM). In
the innocent form, Murga-troyd is wonderful. He is a celebrated poet, painter,
philanthropist or scientist, and naive young women frequently travel a long way
in the hope of meeting him so that they can sit adoringly at his feet and
romanticize his imperfections. A more sophisticated woman who sets out deliberately
to have an affair or a marriage with such a man, whom she sincerely admires and
appreciates, may be fully aware of his weaknesses. She may even exploit them in
order to get what she wants. With these two types of women, the game arises
from the romanticizing or exploiting of the imperfections, while the innocence lies
in their genuine respect for his accomplishments, which they are able to
evaluate correctly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the dissembled form, Murgatroyd may or may not be wonderful,
but he comes up against a woman incapable of appreciating him in the best
sense, in any case; perhaps she is a high-class prostitute. She plays “Little
Old Me” and uses GYWM as sheer flattery to attain her own ends. Underneath she
is either bewildered by him or laughing at him. But she does not care about
him; what she wants are the perquisites that go with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clinically “Peasant” is played in two similar forms, with
the motto, “Gee you’re wonderful, Professor!” (GYWP). In the innocent form the
patient may stay well as long as she can believe in GYWP, which places an
obligation on the therapist to be well-behaved both in public and in private
life. In the dissembled form the patient hopes the therapist will go along with
her GYWP and think: “You’re uncommonly perceptive” (YUP). Once she has him in
this position, she can make him look foolish and then move on to another
therapist; if he cannot be so easily beguiled, he may actually be able to help
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The simplest way for the patient to win GYWP is not to get
better. If she is more malicious, she may take more positive steps to make the
therapist look foolish. One woman played GYWP with her psychiatrist without any
alleviation of symptoms; she finally left him with many salaams and apologies.
She then went to her revered clergyman for help and played GYWP with him. After
a few weeks she seduced him into a game of second-degree “Rapo.” She then told
her neighbor confidentially over the back fence how disappointed she was that
so fine a man as Rev. Black could, in a moment of weakness, make a pass at an
innocent and unattractive women like herself. Knowing his wife, she could
forgive him, of course, but nevertheless, etc. This confidence just slipped out
inadvertently, and it was only afterward that she remembered “to her horror”
that the neighbor was an elder in the church. With her psychiatrist she won by
not getting better; with her clergyman she won by seducing him, although she
was reluctant to admit it. But a second psychiatrist introduced her to a
therapy group where she could not maneuver as she had before. Then, with no
GYWP and YUP to fill in her therapeutic time, she began to examine her behavior
more closely and with the help of the group was able to give up both her
games—GYWP and “Rapo.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The therapist must first decide whether the game
is played innocently and hence should be allowed to continue for the benefit of
the patient until her Adult is sufficiently well-established to risk
countermeasures. If it is not innocent, the countermeasures may be taken at the
first appropriate opportunity, after the patient has been sufficiently well
prepared so that she will be able to understand what happens. The therapist
then steadfastly refuses to give advice, and when the patient begins to
protest, he makes it clear that this is not merely “Poker-Faced Psychiatry” but
a well-thought-out policy. In due time his refusals may either enrage the
patient or precipitate acute anxiety symptoms. The next step depends on the
malignancy of the patient’s condition. If she is too upset, her acute reactions
should be dealt with by appropriate psychiatric or analytic procedures to
re-establish the therapeutic situation. The first goal, in the dissembled form,
is to split off the Adult from the hypocritical Child so that the game can be
analyzed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In social situations, intimate entanglements with innocent
GYWM players should be avoided, as any intelligent actor’s agent will impress
upon his clients. On the other hand, women who play dissembled GYWM are
sometimes interesting and intelligent if they can be de-GYWMed, and may turn
out to be quite a delightful addition to the family social circle.</p>

<h3>5. Psychiatry</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. Psychiatry as a procedure must be distinguished from
“Psychiatry” as a game. According to the available evidence, presented in
proper clinical form in scientific publications, the following approaches,
among others, are of value in treating psychiatric conditions: shock therapy,
hypnosis, drugs, psychoanalysis, orthopsychiatry and group therapy. There are
others which are less commonly used and will not be discussed here. Any of
these can be used in the game of “Psychiatry,” which is based on the position “I
am a healer,” supported by a diploma: “It says here I am a healer.” It will be
noted that in any case this is a constructive, benevolent position, and that
people who play “Psychiatry” can do a great deal of good, providing they are
professionally trained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is likely, however, that there will be some gain in
therapeutic results if therapeutic ardor is moderated. The antithesis was best
expressed long ago by Ambroise Par£, who said in effect: “I treat them, but God
cures them.” Every medical student learns about this dictum, along with others
such as primitm non nocere, and phrases such as vis medicatrix naturae.
Nonmedical therapists, however, are not likely to be exposed—to these ancient
cautions. The position “I am a healer because it says here that I am a healer”
is likely to be an impairment, and may be replaced to advantage with something
like: “I will apply what therapeutic procedures I have learned in the hope that
they will be of some benefit.” This avoids the possibility of games based on: “Since
I am a healer, if you don’t get better it’s your fault” (e.g., “I’m Only Trying
To Help You” or “Since you’re a healer, I’ll get better for you” (e.g., “Peasant”).
All of this, of course, is known in principle to every conscientious therapist.
Certainly every diera-pist who has ever presented a case at a reputable clinic
has been made aware of it. Conversely, a good clinic may be defined as one
which makes its therapists aware of these things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other side, the game of “Psychiatry” is more apt to
crop up with patients who have previously been treated bv less competent
therapists. A few patients, for example, carefully pick weak psychoanalysts,
moving From one to another, demonstrating that they cannot be cured and
meanwhile learning to play a sharper and sharper game of “Psychiatry”; eventually
it becomes difficult for even a first-rate clinician to separate the wheat from
the chaff. The duplex transaction on the patient’s side is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult:  “1 am coming to be cured.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Child: “You will never cure me, but you will teach me to be
a better neurotic (play a better game of ‘Psychiatry’).”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mental Health” is played similarly; here the Adult
statement is, “Everything will get better if I apply the principles of mental
health which I have read and heard about.” One patient learned to play “Psychiatry”
from one therapist, “Mental Health” from another, and then as a result of still
another effort began to play a pretty good game of “Transactional Analysis.”
When this was frankly discussed with her, she agreed to stop playing “Mental
Health,” but requested that she be allowed to continue to play “Psychiatry”
because it made her feel comfortable. The transactional psychiatrist agreed.
She continued, therefore, for several months to recite her dreams and her interpretations
of them at weekly intervals. Finally, partly out of plain gratitude, perhaps,
she decided that it might be interesting to find out what was really the matter
with her. She became seriously interested in transactional analysis, with good
results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A variant of “Psychiatry” is “Archaeology” (title by
courtesy of Dr. Norman Reider of San Francisco), in which the patient takes the
position that if she can only find out who had the button, so to speak, everything
will suddenly be all right. This results in a continual rumination over
childhood happenings. Sometimes the therapist may he beguiled into a game of “Critique,”
in which the patient describes her feelings in various situations and the
therapist tells her what is wrong with them. “Self-Expression,” which is a
common game in some therapy groups, is based on the dogma “Feelings are Good.”
A patient who uses vulgar expletives, for example, may be applauded or at least
implicitly lauded. A sophisticated group, however, will soon spot this as a
game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some members of therapy groups become quite adept at picking
out games of “Psychiatry,” and will soon let a new patient know if they think
he is playing “Psychiatry” or “Transactional Analysis” instead of using group
procedures to obtain legitimate insight. A woman who transferred from a
Self-Expression group in one city to a more sophisticated group in another city
told a story about an incestuous relationship in her childhood. Instead of the
awe which she had come to expect whenever she told this oft-repeated tale, she
was greeted with indifference, whereupon she became enraged. She was astonished
to discover that the new group was more interested in her transactional anger
than in her historical incest, and in irate tones she hurled what apparently in
her mind was the ultimate insult: she accused them of not being Freudian.
Freud, himself, of course, took psychoanalysis more seriously, and avoided
making a game of it by saying that he himself was not a Freudian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recently  unmasked  is   a   new  variant   of  “Psychiatry”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>called “Tell Me This,” somewhat similar to the party pastime
“Twenty Questions.” White relates a dream or an incident, and the other
members, often including die therapist, then attempt to interpret it by asking
pertinent questions. As long as White answers the questions, each member
continues his inquiries until he finds a question White cannot answer. Then
Black sits back with a knowing look which says: “Aha! If you could answer that
one, you would certainly get better, so I have done my part.” (This is a distant
relative of “Why Don’t You—Yes But”). Some therapy groups are based almost
entirely on diis game, and may go on for years with only minimal change or
progress. “Tell Me This” allows much latitude to White (the patient) who, for
example, can play along with it by feeling ineffectual; or he can counter it by
answering all the questions offered, in which case the anger and dismay of the
other players soon becomes manifest, since he is throwing back at them, “I’ve
answered all your questions and you haven’t cured me, so what does that make
you?” “Tell Me This” is also played in schoolrooms, where the pupils know that
the “right” answer to an open-ended question asked by a certain type of teacher
is not to be found by processing the factual data, but by guessing or
outguessing which of several possible answers will make the teacher happy. A
pedantic variant occurs in teaching ancient Greek; the teacher always has the
upper hand over the pupil, and can make him look stupid and prove it in print
by pointing to some obscure feature of the text. This is also often played in
teaching Hebrew.</p>

<h3>6. Stupid</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. In its milder form, the thesis of “Stupid” is, “I
laugh with you at my own clumsiness and stupidity.” Seriously disturbed people,
however, may play it in a sullen way which says, “I am stupid, that’s the way I
am, so do me something.” Both forms are played from a depressive position. “Stupid”
must be distinguished from “Schlemiel,”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where the position is more aggressive, and the clumsiness is
a bid for forgiveness. It must also be distinguished from “Clown,” which is not
a game but a pastime which reinforces the position “I am cute and harmless.”
The critical transaction in “Stupid” is for White to make Black call him stupid
or respond as though he were stupid. Hence White acts like a Schlemiel but does
not ask for forgiveness; in fact forgiveness makes him uneasy, because it threatens
his position. Or he behaves clownishly, but with no implication that he is
kidding; he wants his behavior to be taken seriously, as evidence of real stupidity.
There is considerable external gain, since the less White learns, the more
effectively he can play. Hence at school he need not study, and at work he need
not go out of his way to learn anything that might lead to advancement. He has
known from an early age that everyone will be satisfied with him as long as he
is stupid, despite any expressions to the contrary. People are surprised when
in time of stress, if he decides to come through, it turns out that he is not
stupid at all—any more than is the “stupid” younger son in the fairy tale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. The antithesis of the milder form is simple. By
not playing, by not laughing at the clumsiness or railing at the stupidity, the
anti-”Stupid” player will make a friend for life. One of the subtleties is that
this game is often played by cyclothymic or manic-depressive personalities.
When such people are euphoric, it seems as though they really want their associates
to join in their laughter at themselves. It is often hard not to, for they give
the impression that they will resent an abstainer—which in a way they do, since
he threatens their position and spoils the game. But when they are depressed,
and their resentment against those who laughed with or at them comes into the
open, the abstainer knows that he has acted correctly. He may be the only one
the patient is willing to have in the room or talk to when he is withdrawn, and
all the former “friends” who enjoyed the game are now treated as enemies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>///It is no use telling White that he is not really stupid.
He may actually be of quite limited intelligence and well aware of it, which is
how the game got started in the first place. There may be special areas,
however, in which he is superior: often psychological insight is one. It does
no harm to show whatever respect is deserved for such aptitudes, but this is
different from clumsy attempts at “reassurance.” The latter may give him the
bitter satisfaction of realizing that other people are even more stupid than
he, but this is small consolation. Such “reassurance” is certainly not the most
intelligent therapeutic procedure; usually it is a move in a game of “I’m Only
Trying to Help You.” The antithesis of “Stupid” is not to substitute another
game, but simply to refrain from playing “Stupid.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The antithesis of the sullen form is a more complicated problem,
because the sullen player is trying to provoke not laughter or derision but
helplessness or exasperation, which he is well equipped to handle in accordance
with his challenge “So do me something.” Thus he wins either way. If Black does
nothing, it is because he feels helpless, and if he does something, it is
because he is exasperated. Hence these people are prone also to play “Why Don’t
You—Yes But,” from which they can get the same satisfactions in milder form.
There is no easy solution in this case, nor is there likely to be one
forthcoming until the psychodynamics of this game are more clearly understood.</p>

<h3>7. Wooden Leg</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. The most dramatic form of “Wooden Leg” is “The Plea
of Insanity.” This may be translated into trans-actional terms as follows: “What
do you expect of someone as emotionally disturbed as I am—that I would refrain
from killing people?” To which the jury is asked to reply: “Certainly not, we
would hardly impose that restriction on you!” “The Plea of Insanity,” played as
a legal game, is acceptable to American culture and is different from the
almost universally respected principle that an individual may be suffering from
a psychosis so profound that no reasonable person would expect him to be responsible
for his actions. In Japan drunkenness, and in Russia war-time military service,
are accepted as excuses for evading responsibility for all kinds of outrageous
behavior (according to this writer’s information).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The thesis of “Wooden Leg” is, “What do you expect of a man
with a wooden leg?” Put that way, of course, no one would expect anything of a
man with a wooden leg except that he should steer his own wheel chair. On the
other hand, during World War II there was a man with a wooden leg who used to
give demonstrations of jitterbug dancing, and very competent jitterbug dancing,
at Army Hospital amputation centers. There are blind men who practice law and
hold political offices (one such is currently mayor of the writer’s home town),
deaf men who practice psychiatry and handless men who can use a typewriter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As long as someone with a real, exaggerated or even
imaginary disability is content with his lot, perhaps no one should interfere.
But the moment he presents himself for psychiatric treatment, the question
arises if he is using his life to his own best advantage, and if he can rise
above bis disability. In this country the therapist will be working in opposition
to a large mass of educated public opinion. Even the close relatives of tbe
patient who complained most loudly about the inconveniences caused by his
infirmity, may eventually rum on the therapist if the patient makes definitive
progress. This is readily understandable to a game analyst, but it makes his
task no less difficult. All the people who were playing “I’m Only Trying to
Help You” are threatened by tbe impending disruption of the game if the patient
shows signs of striking out on his own, and sometimes they use almost
incredible measures to terminate the treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both sides are illustrated by the case of the stuttering
client of Miss Black’s, mentioned in the discussion of the game “Indigence.”
This man played a classical form of “Wooden Leg.” He was unable to find
employment, which he correctly attributed to the fact that he was a stutterer,
since the only career that interested him, he said, was that of salesman. As a
free citizen he had a right to seek employment in whatever field he chose, but
as a stutterer, bis choice raised some question as to the purity of his
motives. The reaction of the helpful agency when Miss Black attempted to break
up this game was very unfavorable to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wooden Leg” is especially pernicious in clinical practice,
because the patient may find a therapist who plays the same game with the same
plea, so that progress is impossible. Tliis is relatively easy to arrange in
the case of the “Ideological Plea,” “What do you expect of a man who lives in a
society like ours?” One patient combined this with the “Psychosomatic Plea,” “What
do you expect of a man with psychosomatic symptoms?” He found a succession of
therapists who would accept one plea but not the other, so that none of them
either made him feel comfortable in his current position by accepting both
pleas, or budged him from it by rejecting both. Thus he proved that psychiatry
couldn’t help people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the pleas which patients use to excuse symptomatic
behavior are colds, head injuries, situational stress, the stress of modem
living, American culture and the economic system. A literate player has no
difficulty in finding authorities to support him. “I drink because I’m Irish.” “This
wouldn’t happen if I lived in Russia or Tahiti.” Tbe fact is that patients in
mental hospitals in Russia and Tahiti are very similar to those in American
state hospitals.1 Special pleas of “If It Weren’t For Them” or “They Let Me
Down” should always be evaluated very carefully in clinical practice—and also
in social research projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Slightly more sophisticated are such pleas as: What do you expect
of a man who (a) comes from a broken home Cb) is neurotic (c) is in analysis or
(d) is suffering from a disease known as alcoholism? These are topped by, “If I///stop
doing this I won’t be able to analyze it, and then I’ll never get better.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The obverse of “Wooden Leg” is “Rickshaw,” with the thesis, “If
they only had (rickshaws) (duckbill platypuses) (girls who spoke ancient
Egyptian) around this town, I never would have got into this mess.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. Anti-”Wooden Leg” is not difficult if the
therapist can distinguish clearly between his own Parent and Adult, and if the
therapeutic aim is explicitly understood by both parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the Parental side, he can be either a “good” Parent or a “harsh”
one. As a “good” Parent he can accept the patient’s plea, especially if it fits
in with his own viewpoints, perhaps with the rationalization that people are
not responsible for their actions until they have completed their therapy. As a
“harsh” Parent he can reject the plea and engaoe in a contest of wills with the
patient. Both of these attitudes are already Familiar to the “Wooden Leg”
player, and he knows how to extract the maximum satisfactions from each of
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As an Adult, the therapist declines both of these
opportunities. When the patient asks, “What do you expect of a neurotic?” (or
whatever plea he is using at the moment) the reply is, “I don’t expect
anything. The question is, what do you expect of yourself?” The only demand he
makes is that the patient give a serious answer to this question, and the only
concession he makes is to allow the patient a reasonable length of time to
answer it: anywhere from six weeks to six months, depending on the relationship
between them and the patient’s previous preparation.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twelve. Good Games</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE psychiatrist, who is in the best and perhaps the only
position to study games adequately, unfortunately deals almost entirely with
people whose games have led them into difficulties. This means that die games
which are offered for clinical investigation are all in some sense “bad” ones.
And since by definition games are based on ulterior transactions, they must all
have some element of exploitation. For these two reasons, practical on the one
hand and theoretical on the other, the search for “good” games becomes a
difficult quest. A “good” game might be described as one whose social
contribution outweighs the complexity of its motivations, particularly if the
player has come to terms widi those motivations without futility or cynicism.
That is, a “good” game would be one which contributes both to the well-being of
the other players and to the unfolding of the one who is “it.” Since even under
the best forms of social action and organization a large proportion of time has
to be spent in playing games, the search for “good” ones must be assiduously
pursued. Several examples are offered here, but they are admittedly deficient
in both number and quality. They include “Busman’s Holiday,” “Cavalier,” “Happy
to Help,” “Homely Sage” and “They’ll Be Glad They Knew Me.”</p>

<h3>1. Busman’s Holiday</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. Strictly speaking, this is a pastime rather than a
game, and evidently a constructive one for all concerned. An American mail
carrier goes to Tokyo to help a Japanese postman on his rounds, or an American
ear-nose-and-throat specialist who spends his holiday working in a Haitian hospital,
will very likely feel just as refreshed and have just as good stories to tell
as if he had gone hunting in Africa or spent the time driving through
transcontinental highway traffic. The Peace Corps has now given official
sanction to Busman’s Holiday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Busman’s Holiday” becomes a game, however, if the work is
secondary to some ulterior motive and is undertaken merely as a show in order
to accomplish something else. Even under those circumstances, however, it still
keeps its constructive quality and is one of the more commendable covers for
other activities (which may also be constructive).</p>

<h3>2. Cavalier</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is a game played by men who are not under
sexual pressure—occasionally by younger men who have a satisfactory marriage
or  liaison,   more often  by older men who are gracefully resigned to monogamy
or celibacy—Upon encountering a suitable female subject,  White takes every
opportunity to remark upon her good qualities, never transgressing the limits
appropriate to her station in life, the immediate social situation and the
requirements of good taste. But within those limits he allows full play to his
creativity, enthusiasm and originality. The object is not to seduce but to
exhibit his virtuosity in the art of effective compliment. The internal social
advantage lies in the pleasure given to the woman by this innocent artistry,
and by her responsive appreciation of White’s skill. In suitable cases, where
both are aware of the nature of the game, it may be stretched with increasing
delight on both sides, to the point of extravagance. A man of the world, of
course, will know when to stop, and will not continue beyond the point at which
he ceases to amuse (out of consideration for her) or where the quality of his
offerings begins to deteriorate (out of consideration  for  his   own   pride  
of  craftsmanship).   “Cavalier”   is played for its external social advantages
in the case of poets, who are as much, or more, interested in the appreciation
of qualified critics and the public at large as they are in the response of the
lady who inspired them.///The Europeans in romance, and the British in poetry,
seem always to have been more adept at this game than the Americans. In our
country it has fallen largely into the hands of the Fruit Stand school of poetry:
your eyes are like avocados, your lips like cucumbers, etc. “Cavalier,” Fruit
Stand Type, can hardly compare in elegance with the productions of Herrick and
Lovelace, or even with the cynical but imaginative works of Rochester, Roscommon
and Dorset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Antithesis. It takes some sophistication for the woman to
play her part well, and a great deal of sulkiness or stupidity for her to
refuse to play it at all. The proper complement is a variant of “Gee You’re
Wonderful Mr. Murgatroyd” (GYWM): namely, “I Admire Your Productions, Mr. M.”
If the woman is mechanical or unperceptive, she may respond with plain GYWM,
but that misses the point: what White is offering for appreciation is not
himself, but his poetry. The brutal antithesis from a sulky woman is to play
Second-Degree “Rapo” (“Buzz Off, Buster”). Third-Degree “Rapo,” which could
conceivably occur, would of course be an unspeakably vile response under the
circumstances. If the woman is merely stupid, she will play First-Degree “Rapo,”
taking the compliments to feed her vanity and neglecting to appreciate Whites
creative efforts and abilities. In general, the game is spoiled if the woman
treats it as an attempt at seduction rather than as a literary exhibition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relatives. “Cavalier” being a game, it must be distinguished
from the operations and procedures carried on during a straightforward
courtship, which are simple transactions without ulterior motive. The female
counterpart of Cavalier” may be conveniently called “Blarney,” since it is
often played by gallant Irish ladies in their sunset years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PARTIAL ANALYSIS Aim: Mutual admiration. Roles: Poet,
Appreciative subject. Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult (male):   “See how good I can make you feel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adult (female):   “My, but you make me feel good.” Psychological
Paradigm:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Child (male):  “See what phrases I can create.” Child
(female): “My, but you’re creative.” Advantages:   (1)   Internal   Psychological—creativity  
and reassurance   of   attractiveness.   (2)   External   Psychological—avoids
rejection for unnecessary sexual advances.  (3)  Internal Social—”Cavalier.”
(4) External Social—these may be resigned. (5) Biological—mutual stroking. (6)
Existential—I can live gracefully.</p>

<h3>3. Happy To Help</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. White is consistently helpful to other people, with
some ulterior motive. He may be doing penance For past wickedness, covering up
for present wickedness, making friends in order to exploit them later or
seeking prestige. But whoever questions his motives must also give him credit
for his actions. After all, people can cover up for past wickedness by becoming
more wicked, exploit people by fear rather than generosity and seek prestige
for evil ways instead of good ones. Some philanthropists are more interested in
competition than in benevolence: “I gave more money (works of art, acres of
land) than you did.” Again, if their motives are questioned, they must
nevertheless be given credit for competing in a constructive way, since there
are so many people who compete destructively. Most people (or peoples) who play
“Happy to Help” have both friends and enemies, both perhaps justified in their
feelings. Their enemies attack their motives and minimize their actions, while
their friends are grateful for their actions and minimize their motives.
Therefore so-called “objective” discussions of this game are practically
nonexistent. People who claim to be neutral soon show which side they are
neutral on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This game, as an exploitative maneuver, is the basis for a
large proportion of “public relations” in America. But the customers are glad
to become involved, and it is perhaps the most pleasant and constructive of the
commercial games. In another connection, one of its most reprehensible forms is
a three-handed family game in which the mother and father compete for the affection
of their offspring. But even here, it should be noted, the choice of “Happy to
Help” removes some of the discredit, since there are so many unpleasant ways of
competing available—for example, “Mommy is sicker than daddy,” or “Why do you
love him more than you love me?”</p>

<h3>4. Homely Sage</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thesis. This is properly a script rather than a game, but it
has gamelike aspects. A well-educated and sophisticated man learns as much as
he can about all sorts of things besides his own business. When he reaches retirement
age, he moves from the big city where he held a responsible position to a small
town. There it soon becomes known that people can go to him with their problems
of whatever kind, from a knock in the engine to a senile relative, and that he
will help them himself if he is competent or else refer them to qualified
experts. Thus he soon finds his place in his new environment as a “Homely Sage,”
making no pretenses, hut always willing to listen. In its best form it is
played by people who have taken the trouble to go to a psychiatrist to examine
their motives, and to learn what errors to avoid before setting themselves up
in this role,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5 THEY’LL BE GLAD THEY KNEW ME Thesis. This is a more worthy
variant of “I’ll Show Them.” There are two forms of “I’ll Show Them.” In the
destructive form White “shows them” by inflicting damage on them. Thui he may
maneuver himself into a superior position, not for the prestige or the material
rewards hut because it gives him power to exercise his spite. In the
constructive form White works hard and exerts every effort to gain prestige,
not for the sake of craftsmanship or legitimate accomplishment (although those
may play a secondary role), nor to inflict direct damage on his enemies, but so
that they will be eaten with envy and with regret for not having treated him
better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In “They’ll Be Glad They Knew Me,” White is working not
against but for the interests of his former associates. He wants to show them
that they were justified in treating him with friendliness and respect and to
demonstrate to them, for their own gratification, that their judgment was
sound. In order for him to have a secure win in this game, his means as well as
his ends must be honorable, and that is its superiority over “I’ll Show Them.”
Both “I’ll Show Them” and “They’ll Be Glad” can be merely secondary advantages
of success, rather than games. They become games when White is more interested
in the effects on his enemies or friends than he is in the success itself.</p>

<h1>Part III: Beyond Games</h1>

<h2>Chapter Thirteen. The Significance Of Games</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Games are passed on from generation to generation. The favored
game of any individual can be traced back to his parents and grandparents, and
forward to bis children; they in turn, unless there is a successful
intervention, will teach them to his grandchildren. Thus game analysis takes
place in a grand historical matrix, demonstrably extending back as far as one
hundred years and reliably projected into the future for at least fifty years.
Breaking this chain which involves five or more generations may have geometrically
progressive effects. There are many living individuals who have more than 200
descendants. Games may be diluted or altered from one generation to another,
hut there seems to be a strong tendency to inhreed with people who play a game
of the same family, if not of the same genus. That is the historical
significance of games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. “Raising” children is primarily a matter of teaching them
what games to play. Different cultures and different social classes favor different
types of games, and various tribes and families favor different variations of
these. That is the cultural significance of games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Games are sandwiched, as it were, between pastimes and intimacy.
Pastimes gtow boring with repetition, as do promotional cocktail parties.
Intimacy requires stringent circumspection, and is discriminated against by
Parent, Adult and Child. Society frowns upon candidness, except in privacy;
good sense knows that it can always be abused; and the Child fears it because
of the unmasking which it involves. Hence in order to get away from the ennui
of pastimes without exposing themselves to the dangers of intimacy, most people
compromise for games when they are a\ailable, and these fill the major part of
the more interesting hours of social intercourse. That is the social
significance of games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. People pick as friends, associates and intimates other
people who play the same games. Hence “everybody who is anybody” in a given
social circle (aristocracy, juvenile gang, social club, college campus, etc.)
behaves in a way which n:ay seem quite foreign to members of a different social
circle. Conversely, any member of a social circle who cianges his games will
tend to be extruded, but he will find himself welcome at some other social
circle. That is the personal significance of games.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reader should now be in a position to appreciate the
basic difference between mathematical and transactional game analysis.
Mathematical game analysis postulates players who are completely rational.
Transactional game analysis deals with games vhich are un-rational, or even
irrational, and hence more real.</p>

<h2>Chapter Fourteen. The Players</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>MANY games are played most intensely by disturbed people;
generally speaking, the more disturbed they are, the harder they play—Curiously
enough, however, some schizophrenics seem to refuse to play games, and demand
candid-ness from the beginning. In everyday life games are played with the
greatest conviction by two classes of individuals: the Sulks and the Jerks or
Squares.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sulk is a man who is angry at his mother. On
investigation it emerges that he has been angry at her since early childhood.
He often has good “Child” reasons for his anger: she may have “deserted” him
during a critical period in his boyhood by getting sick and going to the
hospital, or she may have given birth to too many siblings. Sometimes the
desertion is more deliberate; she may have farmed him out in order to remarry.
In any case, he has been sulking ever since. He does not like women, although
he may be a Don Juan. Since sulking is deliberate at’ its inception, the
decision to sulk can be reversed at any period of life, just as it can be
during childhood when it comes time for dinner. The requirements for reversing
the decision are the same for the grown-up Sulk as for the little boy. He must
be able to save face, and he must be offered something worthwhile in exchange
for the privilege of sulking. Sometimes a game of “Psychiatry” which might
otherwise last several years can be aborted by reversing a decision to sulk.
This requires careful preparation of the patient and proper timing and
ap-proach. Clumsiness or bullying on the part of the therapist will have no
better result than it does with a suiky little hoy; in the long run, the patient
will pay the therapist back for his mishandling, just as the little boy will
eventually repay clumsy parents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With female Sulks the situation is the same, mutatis
mutandis, if they are angry at father. Their “Wooden Leg” (“What do you expect
of a woman who had a Father like that/’) must be handled with even more
diplomacy by a male therapist. Otherwise he risks being thrown into the
wastebasket of “men who are like father.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a bit of Jerk in everyone, but the object of game
analysis is to keep it at a minimum. A Jerk is someone who is overly sensitive
to Parental influences. Hence his Adult data processing and his Child’s
spontaneity are likely to be interfered with at critical moments, resulting in
inappropriate or clumsy behavior. In extreme cases the Jerk merges with the
Toady, the Show-off, and the Cling. The )erk is not to be confused with the
bewildered schizophrenic, who has no functioning Parent and very little
functioning Adult, so that he has to cope with the world in the ego state of a
confused Child. It is interesting that in common usage “jerk” is an epithet
applied to men only, or in rare cases to masculine women. A Prig is even more
of a Square than a Jerk; Prig is a word usually reserved for women, but
occasionally it is said of men of somewhat feminine tendencies.</p>

<h2>Chapter Fifteen. A Paradigm</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>CONSIDER the following exchange between a patient (P) and a
therapist (T):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P. “I have a new project—being on time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>T. “I’ll try to cooperate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P. “I don’t care about you. I’m doing it for myself.. , .
Guess what grade I got on my history test!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>T. “B+.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P. “How did you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>T. “Because you’re afraid to get an A.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P. “Yes, I had an A, and I went over my paper and crossed
out three correct answers and put in three wrong ones.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>T. “I like this conversation. It’s Jerk-free.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P. “You know, last night I was thinking how much progress I’ve
made. I figured I was only 17% Jerk now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>T. “Well, so far this morning, it’s zero, so you’re entitled
to 34% discount on the next round.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P. “It all began six months ago, that time I was looking at
my coffeepot, and for the first time I really saw it. And you know how it is
now, how I hear the birds sing, and I look at people and they’re really there
as people, and best of all, I’m really there. And I’m not only there, but right
now I’m here. The other day I was standing in the art gallery looking at a picture,
and a man came up and said, ‘Gauguin is very nice, isn’t he?’ So I said: ‘I
like you too. So we went out and had a drink and he’s a very nice guy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is presented as a Jerk-free, game-free conversation between
two autonomous Adults, with die following annotations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have a new project—being on time.” This announcement was
made after the fact. The patient was nearly always late. This time she wasn’t.
If punctuality had been a resolution, an act of “will power,” an imposition of
the Parent on the Child, made only to be broken, it would have been announced
before the fact: “This is the last time I’ll be late.” That wdftld have been an
attempt to set up a game. Her announcement was not. It was an Adult decision, a
project, not a resolution. The patient continued to be punctual.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ll try to cooperate.” This was not a “supportive”
statement, nor the first move in a new game of “I’m Only Trying to Help You.”
The patient’s hour came after the therapist’s coffee break. Since she was
habitually late, he had fallen into the habit of taking his time and getting
back late himself. When she made her declaration, he knew she meant it, and
made his. The transaction was an Adult contract which both of them kept, and
not a Child teasing a Parental figure who because of his position felt forced
to be a “good daddy” and say he would cooperate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t care about you.” This emphasizes that her
punctuality is a decision, and not a resolution to be exploited as part of a
pseudo-compliant game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Guess what grade I got.” This is a pastime which both were
aware of and felt free to indulge in. There was no need for him to demonstrate
how alert he was by telling her it was a pastime, something she already knew,
and there was no need for her to refrain from playing it just because it was
called a pastime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“B+.” The therapist reckoned that in her case this was the
only possible grade, and there was no reason not to say so. False modesty or a
fear of being wrong might have led him to pretend that he did not know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How did you know?” This was an Adult question, not a game
of “Gee You’re Wonderful,” and it deserved a pertinent answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, I had an A.” This was the real test. The patient did
not sulk with rationalizations or pleas, but faced her Child squarely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I like this conversation.” This and the following
semi-facetious remarks were expressions of mutual Adult respect, with perhaps a
little Parent-Child pastime, which again was optional with both of them, and of
which they were both aware.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“For the first time I really saw it.” She is now entitled to
her own kind of awareness and is no longer obliged to see coffeepots and people
the way her parents told her to. “Right now I’m here.” She no longer lives in
the firture or the past, but can discuss them briefly if it serves a useful
purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I said: ‘I like you too.’” She is not obliged-to waste time
playing “Art Gallery” with the newcomer, although she could if she chose to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The therapist, on his part, does not feel obliged to play “Psychiatry.”
There were several opportunities to bring up questions of defense, transference
and symbolic interpretation, but he was able to let these go by without feeling
any anxiety. It did seem worthwhile, however, to ascertain for future reference
which answers she crossed out on her examination. During the rest of the hour,
unfortunately, the 17% of Jerk left in the patient and the 18% left in the
therapist showed from time to time. In summary, the proceedings given
constitute an activity enlightened with some pastime.</p>

<h2>Chapter Sixteen. Autonomy</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE attainment of autonomy is manifested by the release or
recovery of three capacities:   awareness, spontaneity and intimacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Awareness. Awareness means the capacity to see a coffeepot
and hear the birds sing in one’s own way, and not the way one was taught. It
may be assumed on good grounds that seeing and hearing have a different quality
for infants than for grownups,1 and that they are more esthetic and less
intellectual in the first’ years of life. A litde boy sees and hears birds with
delight. Then the “good father” comes along and feels he should “share” the
experience and help his son “develop.” He says: “That’s a jay, and this is a
sparrow.” The moment the little boy is concerned with which is a jay and which
is a sparrow, he can no longer see the birds or hear them sing. He has to see
and hear them the way his father wants him to. Father has good reasons on his
side, since few people can afford to go through life listening to the birds
sing, and the sooner the little boy starts his “education” the better. Maybe he
will be an ornithologist when he grows up. A few people, however, can still see
and hear in the old way. But most of the members of the human race have lost
the capacity to be painters, poets or musicians, and are not left the option of
seeing and hearing directly even if they can afford to; they must get it
secondhand. The recovery of this ability is called here “awareness.”
Physiologically awareness is eidetic perception, allied to eidetic imagery.2
Perhaps there is also eidetic perception, at least in certain individuals, in
the spheres of taste, smell and kinesthesia, giving us the artists in those
fields: chefs, perfumers and dancers, whose eternal problem is to find audiences
capable of appreciating their products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Awareness requires living in the here and now, and not in
the elsewhere, the past or the future. A good illustration of possibilities, in
American life, is driving to work in the morning in a hurry. The decisive
question is: “Where is the mind when the body is here?” and there are three
common cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. The man whose chief preoccupation is being on time is die
one who is furthest out. With his body at the wheel of his car, his mind is at
the door of his office, and he is oblivious to his immediate surroundings
except insofar as they are obstacles to the moment when his soma will catch up
with his psyche. This is the Jerk, whose chief concern is how it will look to
the boss. If he is late, he will take pains to arrive out of breath. The
compliant Child is in command, and his game ie “Look How Hard I’ve Tried.”
While he is driving, he is almost completely lacking in autonomy, and as a
human being he is in essence more dead than alive. It is quite possible that
this is the most favorable condition for the development of hypertension or
coronary disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. The Sulk, on the other hand, is not so much concerned
with arriving on time as in collecting excuses foi being late. Mishaps, badly
timed lights and poor driving or stupidity on the part of others fit well into
his scheme and are secretly welcomed as contributions to his rebellious Child
or righteous Parent game of “Look What They Made Me Do.” He, too, is oblivious
to his surroundings except as they subscribe to his game, so that he is only
half alive. His body is in his car, but his mind is out searching for blemishes
and injustices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Less common is the “natural driver,” the man to whom driving
a car is a congenial science and art. As he makes his way swiftly and
skillfully through the traffic, he is at one with his vehicle. He, too, is
oblivious of his surroundings except as they offer scope for the craftsmanship
which is its own reward, but he is very much aware of himself and the machine
which he controls so well, and to that extent he is alive. Such driving is
formally an Adult pastime from which his Child and Parent may also derive
satisfaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. The Fourth case is the person who is aware, and who will
not hurry because he is living in the present moment with the environment which
is here: the sky and the trees as well as the feeling of morion. To hurry is to
neglect that environment and to be conscious only of something that is still
out of sight down the road, or of mere obstacles, or solely of oneself. A
Chinese man started to get into a local subway train, when his Caucasian
companion pointed out that they could save twenty minutes by taking an express,
which they did. When they got off at Central Park, the Chinese man sat down on
a bench, much to his friend’s surprise. “Well,” explained the former, “since we
saved twenty minutes, we can afford to sit here that long and enjoy our
surroundings.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The aware person is alive because he knows how he feels,
where he is and when it is. He knows that after he dies the trees will still be
there, but he will not be there to look at them again, so he wants to see them
now widi as much poignancy as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spontaneity. Spontaneity means option, the freedom to choose
and express one’s feelings from the assortment available (Parent feelings,
Adult Feelings and Child feelings). It means liberation, liberation from the
compulsion to play games and have only the feelings one was taught to have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Intimacy. Intimacy means the spontaneous, game-free candidness
of an aware person, the liberation of the eidet-ically perceptive, uncorrupted
Child in all its naivete” living in the here and now. It can be shown
experimentally3 that eidetic perception evokes affection, and that candidness
mobilizes positive feelings, so that there is even such a thing as “one-sided intimacy”~a
phenomenon well known, although not by that name, to professional seducers, who
are able to capture their partners without becoming involved themselves. This
they do by encouraging the other person to look at them directly and to talk
Freely, while the male or Female seducer makes only a well-guarded pretense of
reciprocating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because intimacy is essentially a function of the natural
Child (although expressed in a matrix of psychological and social complications),
it tends to turn out well if not disturbed by the intervention of games.
Usually the adaptation to Parental influences is what spoils it, and most
unfortunately this is almost a universal occurrence. But before, unless and
until they are corrupted, mos* infants seem to be loving,4 and dial is the
essential nature of intimacy, as shown experimentally,</p>

does. Distinguishing a game from a pastime is no easier than distinguishing a
star from a planet. See Berne, E. “The Intimacy Experiment.” Transactional

<p class=MsoNormal>4. Some infants are corrupted or starved very early
(marasmus, some colics) and never nave a chance to exercise this capacity.</p>

<h2>Chapter Seventeen. The Attainment Of Autonomy</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>PARENTS, deliberately or unaware, teach their children from
birth how to behave, diink, feel and perceive. Liberation from these influences
is no easy matter, since they are deeply ingrained and are necessary during the
first two or three decades of life for biological and social survival. Indeed,
such liberation is only possible at all because the individual starts off in an
autonomous state, that is, capable of awareness, spontaneity and intimacy, and
he has some discretion as to which parts of his parents’ teachings he will
accept. At certain specific moments early in life he decides how he is going to
adapt to diem. It is because his adaptation is in the nature of a series of
decisions that it can be undone, since decisions are reversible under favorable
circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The attainment of autonomy, then, consists of the overthrow
of all those irrelevancies discussed in Chapters 13, 14 and 15. And such
overthrow is never final: there is a continual battle against sinking back into
the old ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, as discussed in Chapter 13, the weight of a whole tribal
or family historical tradition has to be lifted, as in the case of Margaret
Mead’s villagers in New Guinea1; then the influence of the individual parental,
social and cultural background has to be thrown off. The same must be done with
the demands of contemporary society at large, and finally die advantages
derived from one’s immediate social circle have to be partly or wholly sacrificed.
Then all the easy indulgences and rewards of being a Sulk or a Jerk, as
described in Chapter 14, have to be given up. Following this, the individual
must attain personal and social control, so that all the classes of behavior
described in the Appendix, except perhaps dreams, become free choices subject
only to his will. He is then ready for game-free relationships such as that
illustrated in the paradigm in Chapter 15, At this point he may be able to
develop his capacities for autonomy. In essence, diis whole preparation
consists of obtaining a friendly divorce from one’s parents (and from other
Parental influences) so that they may be agreeably visited on occasion, but are
no longer dominant.</p>

<h2>Chapter Eighteen. After Games, What?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE somber picture presented in Parts I and II of this book,
in which human life is mainly a process of filling in time until the arrival of
death, or Santa Claus, with very little choice, if any, of what kind of
business one is going to transact during the long wait, is a commonplace but
not the final answer. For certain fortunate people there is something which
transcends all classifications of behavior, and that is awareness; something
which rises above the programming of the past, and that is spontaneity; and
something that is more rewarding than games, and that is intimacy. But all
three of these may be frightening and even perilous to the unprepared. Perhaps
they are better off as they are, seeking their solutions in popular techniques
of social action, such as “togetherness.” This may mean that there is no hope
for the human race, but there is hope for individual members of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>///APPENDIX. The Classification of Behavior</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AT ANY given moment a human being is engaged in one or more
of the following classes of behavior:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CLASS i. Internally programed (archaeopsychic). Autistic behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Orders: (a) Dreams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b) Fantasies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Families:     i. Extraneous fantasies (wish fulfillment).
ii. Autistic      transactions,       Un—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>adapted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>iii. Autistic   transactions,   Adapted (with neopsychic
programing).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(c) Fugues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(d) Delusional behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(e) Involuntary actions. Families:     i. Tics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ii.  Mannerisms, iii. Parapraxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(f) Others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CLASS ii. Probability programed (neopsycKic). Reality-tested
behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Orders: (a) Activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Families:     i. Professions, trades, etc. ii.  Sports,
hobbies, etc,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b) Procedures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Families:     i.  Data processing, ii. Techniques.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(c) Others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CLASS in. Socially programed (partly exteropsychic). Social
behavior.///Orders: (a)  Rituals and  ceremonies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b)  Pastimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(c)  Operations and maneuvers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(d) Games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suborders: A.  Professional games (angular transactions).
B.   Social games (duplex transactions).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(e)  Intimacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this scheme the social games previously discussed would
be classified as follows: Class III, Socially programed; Order (d), Games;
Suborder B, Social Games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Intimacy, “the end of the line,” is the final
classification, and is part of game-free living.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reader should feel free to carp (but not to gleek or
fleer) at the above classification. It is included not because the writer is in
love with it, but because it is more functional, real and practical than other
systems now in use and can be helpful to those who like or need taxonomy.</p>
