                  <p><strong>1. Beyond our knowledge</strong></p>
                  <p>Economists
and politicians are worried: they call it crisis and they hope it is
going to unfold like the numerous previous crisis that stormed the
Economy in the past century and then passed away, leaving Capitalism
stronger. I think this time it is different. This is not a crisis, but
the symptom of the incompatibility of the potency of productive forces
(cognitive labour in the global network) and the paradigm of growth.
This is not a crisis but the final collapse of a system that has lasted
for five hundred years. </p>
                  <p>Look at the
landscape: the world's great powers are trying to rescue financial
institutions. But the financial collapse has affected the industrial
system, the demand is falling, jobs are lost by the millions. In order
to rescue the banks the State is taking money from the taxpayers of
tomorrow, and this means that the demand is going to fall further in
the next years. Family spending is plummeting, and consequently much
industrial production is going to be dismissed. It's not going to last
just one or two years, this time is forever. </p>
                  <p>&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>In
an article published by the International Herald Tribune the
moderate-conservative David Brooks writes: &#8220;I worry that we are
operating far beyond our economic knowledge.&#8221; This is the point: the
complexity of the global economy is far beyond any knowledge and
governance. Presenting Obama's rescue plan, on February 10 th 2009,
Timothy Geithner, the US Secretary of Treasure, said: &#8220;I want to be
candid. This comprehensive strategy will cost money, involve risk and
take time. We will have to adapt it as conditions change. We will have
to try things we've never tried before. We will make mistakes. We will
go through periods in which things get worse and progress is uneven or
interrupted.&#8221; Although these words show Geithner's intellectual honesty
and the impressive difference of the new leading American class
compared to the Bushites, they also point out the breakdown of
political self-confidence. </p>
                  <p>The political
knowledge we have inherited from Modern Rationalist philosophy is
useless now. Chaos (i.e. a degree of complexity which is beyond the
ability of human understanding) is the new king of the world. The
problems that the world is facing nowadays cannot be solved by the way
of adaptation and rationalization of Economy. The capitalist paradigm
can no longer be the universal rule of the human activity. </p>
                  <p>Let's face it: the history of modern capitalism is over. So what? </p>
                  <p><strong>2. Net VS Crime</strong></p>
                  <p>Let's
have a retrospective look at the rise and decline of the Neoliberal
economy, the economy of the law of the strongest. There are two faces,
in the post-modern economy of the last thirty years: one face can be
labelled 'Net-Economy', the other 'Criminal capitalism'. The
Net-economy is based on collaboration and sharing, on the creation of
new ways of managing social activity. The Net-economy is challenging
the proprietary principle that has ruled Modern capitalist society. </p>
                  <p>In
order to reassess and re-impose the proprietary rule, Capitalism has
reacted in a criminal way: the criminal face of capitalism is based on
the abandonment of every legal rule in the pursuit of profit and the
sanctification of competition. Criminal politics has led the global
economy to the present mess, but criminals are still in power in every
country, although they have failed to govern the chaotic reality
created by deregulation. The Neo-liberal ideology has failed, but those
who have been thriving in the shadow of this neo-liberal deceit cling
to their power and prepare for the final show down. </p>
                  <p>A contradiction is growing between the general intellect and the criminal ruling class. Who's going to win? </p>
                  <p>Obama's
victory in the US may be the opening of a new period in the evolution
of mankind. This event has injected new hope in the peaceful army of
the general intellect all over the world. The new President was voted
in by cognitive labor, and his victory is the defeat of the criminal
class represented by Cheney-Bush. But this victory marks only the
beginning of the fight, that will be the fight of intellectual force
against the brutal force of ignorance, violence and profit. </p>
                  <p>The
criminal class, composed the adventurers of finance, the managers of
big corporations, and mafia-like lumpenbourgeosie has seized power in
two moves: first with the Neoliberal declaration of the primacy of
competition on every ethical, political or legal rule. Second through
the occupation of the system of production of the collective mind: the
media system. Manufacturing social expectations and the collective
imagination, the media system has contrasted and finally overwhelmed
the productive cognitive class, and subjugated the exploited to the bad
dreams of the exploiters. </p>
                  <p>The private
occupation of the social space of communication (advertising, TV&#8230;) has
produced an effect of alienated identification, privatisation of life,
need and consumption. Need is not a natural impulse, but the product of
the cultural action of modelling the social imagination and sensibility
monopolised by the corporate media-system. The privatization of life
has pulverized social solidarity, and forced each person to think in
isolation about his/her own necessities. Take for instance the
privatisation of mobility, as a distortion of the public sphere. An
irrational, polluting and cumbersome object, the private car (three
tons of iron for the displacement of a body that weighs only eighty
kilograms) has been the central object of the industrial production in
the 20th century. </p>
                  <p>Why do cars have to be
private? They could be public objects that every person could take and
use for the time needed, then leave open in the street, ready for
everyone else's transportation. They could be substituted by much more
comfortable public systems of transportation. Why has the public system
of transportation been sabotaged by the ruling class, during the last
decades? We know why very well. The capitalist economy creates scarcity
in the domain of transportation, as in every other domain. The creation
of scarcity is the premise of accumulation, made possible by the
privatization of need. </p>
                  <p>During the 90's the
rise of networked production and the spread of libertarian cyberculture
opened the way to an alliance between financial capitalism and
cognitive work. Under the flag of the dotcom, young intellectuals and
scientists could find money to create their own enterprise, and a
process of redistribution of revenue became possible. But this alliance
was broken when the criminal class took over the new potency of
technology and subjected it to the power of war. The dotcom experience
was captured by the neoliberal lure, and in the first decade of the new
century intellectual labour was made precarious and forced to accept
any kind of economic blackmail. The criminal class enslaved the
cognitive class: knowledge was fractalised, revenue reduced,
exploitation and stress grew and grew. </p>
                  <p>The
dotcom crash and 9/11 marked the subjugation of the high tech
experience, perverting the potency of technology and knowledge,
provoking countless victims, and igniting hatred all over the world.
The mass production of Fear, fanaticism and ignorance were not enough
to get western people's consent to the war. Western citizens were
invited by president Bush to go away and shop. Shopping against Terror,
shopping against psychic depression. But this massive access to
consumption has been financed with a boundless Debt. The Euro-American
population has been systematically pushed to buy huge amounts of
useless things, mentally intoxicated by advertising and forced to
identify happiness with consumption and well-being with numbers of
possessions. </p>
                  <p>The privatization of need and
the reduction of well-being to acquisition has destroyed any sense of
dignity and self-love. The social time of attention has been occupied
by the flow of info-labor and advertising. Language has been absorbed
by labour and deserted by affection. Love, tenderness, sex, affection,
and care for others have been transformed in merchandise. Every single
person has became the owner of many credit cards, a shopping machine,
obliged to work more and more in order to pay an ever growing debt.
Debt turned to be the universal chain, and this created the perfect
conditions for universal collapse. At last the collapse did happen. </p>
                  <p>Growth
will never be back, not only because people will never be able to pay
for the Debt accumulated during the past three decades, but also
because the physical planetary resources are close to exhaustion, and
the nervous resources of the social brain are close to breakdown. So
what next? </p>
                  <p><strong>3. Ethical protest and war</strong></p>
                  <p>At
the end of the 90s, when the process of globalisation and privatisation
was beyond criticism and its devastating potential well hidden in the
words of Neoliberal gurus, a movement of ethical protest surfaced from
the ranks of cognitive labor and from the ranks of workers becoming
conscious of the dangers of deregulation. At the very end of the
capitalist century, in the extreme West of the West, the city of
Seattle, hundreds of thousands people gathered and marched to stop the
WTO summit and protest against the effects of global exploitation. </p>
                  <p>It
was the beginning of the Age of Ethical Demonstrations. From Seattle to
Genova, from Prague to Bologna, to Cancun, crowds of precarious and
cognitive workers marched together. They were the Ethical Consciousness
of the world, and of course they were met by the aggression of the
police, under the instigation of the criminal class. Some were killed
and many were arrested because they were telling the truth. They were
trying to warn the people of the Earth that a great danger was in
sight. Now we know they were right. No-global protesters were giving us
a warning of the coming catastrophe, and now the catastrophe is here. </p>
                  <p>Catastrophe
means, in Greek, a change of position that allows the viewer to see
things that s/he could not see before. Catastrophe opens new spaces of
visibility, and therefore of possibility, but it also demands a change
of paradigm. The ethical demonstrators were defeated after the
world-wide march against the war on February 15th, 2003. One hundred
million people marched against the war in Iraq on that day. President
Bush answered that he did not need the people's advice, and he started
the war. </p>
                  <p>The criminal class of ignorance won against the movement of the General Intellect. That is why the world is collapsing now. </p>
                  <p>Fter
that, violence was opposed with violence and fanatics fought against
fanatics. From Afghanistan to Iraq, from Pakistan to Iran to Georgia,
the US power was defeated everywhere, and isolated. And at the end of
the day, this financial collapse is not without relation to the
geopolitical defeat. While the period of ethical demonstrations was
fading out, a new cycle of insurrection started exploding somewhere in
the West. The riots in the Paris banlieux in November 2005, the
insurrection of the teachers of Oaxaca in 2006, the explosion of a
general rebellion in Greece in December 2008 have been the harbingers
of an insurrectional wave that will storm many parts of the world in
the coming years, while the Recession ravages social life. </p>
                  <p>Scattered
insurrections will take place in the coming years, but we should not
expect much from them. They'll be unable to touch the real centres of
power because of the militarisation of metropolitan space, and they
will not be able to gain much in terms of material wealth or political
power. As the long wave of no-global moral protests could not destroy
Neoliberal power, so the insurrections will not find a solution, not
unless a new consciousness and a new sensibility surfaces and spreads,
changing everyday life, and creating NON temporary autonomous zones
rooted in the culture and consciousness of the global network. </p>
                  <p>Full
employment is over. The world does not need so much labour and so much
exploitation. A radical reduction of labour-time is necessary. Basic
income has to be affirmed as a right to life independent of the
employment and disjoined from the lending of labour-time. Competence,
knowledge, and skills have to be separated from the economic context of
exchange value, and rethought in terms of free social activity. </p>
                  <p><strong>4. Paying the moral debt </strong></p>
                  <p>We
should not look at the current recession from an economic point of
view. We must see it as an anthropological turning point that is going
to change the distribution of world resources and world power. Europe
is doomed to lose its economic privilege, as 500 years of colonialism
are ending. The Debt that Western people have accumulated is not only
economic but also moral: the debt of oppression, violence and genocide
has to be paid now, and it's not going to be easy. A large part of the
European population is not prepared to accept the redistribution of
wealth that the recession will impose. Europe, stormed by waves of
migration, is going to face a growing racist threat. Ethnic war will be
difficult to avoid. In the US, the victory of Barak Obama marks the
beginning of the end of the Western domination that was the premise of
the modern capitalist system. A wave of non identitarian indigenous
Renaissance is rising, especially in Latin America. </p>
                  <p>The
struggle between labour and capital has reached a new phase, one that
may have unpredictable outcomes. We cannot say what the new American
Administration is really going to do. The words of Tim Geithner that I
quoted above show that Obama's Administration is finding its way by
trial and error. This is the meaning of the concept of post-partisan
pragmatism: the old ideological solutions that worked in the 20th
century are now out of order. Both liberalism and socialism seem today
out of touch with reality. The ruling class and the economists are
proposing old ways to face the recession, using old maps for a new
territory. Everybody says &#8220;protectionism has to be avoided&#8221; while in
fact each State is protecting its national economy. Neoliberals say
that the State should rescue the banks, pay the debts and restore
credit, then let private owners manage their enterprises as usual.
Socialists, on their side, say that the State should take over the
banks and nationalize the factories. What difference would it make if
the nationalized factories go on producing the same stuff? </p>
                  <p>The
alternative between public and private ownership is a false one. The
solution is no longer in the realm of the Economy, but in that of
social culture. The model of Growth has been deeply interiorised: it
pervades daily life, perception, needs, and consumption styles.
Cultural action must free society from this model. </p>
                  <p><strong>5. Communism without aufhebung </strong></p>
                  <p>The
privatization of basic needs (housing, transportation, food) and social
services is based on the cultural identification of wealth and
well-being with the amount of private property owned. In the
anthropology of modern capitalism well-being has been equated with
acquisition, never with enjoyment. In the course of the social turmoil
we are going to live through in the coming years, the identification of
well-being with property has to be questioned. It's a political task,
but above all it is a cultural task, and a psychotherapeutic one too. </p>
                  <p>The
theoretical justification of the institution of private property (in
the writings of John Locke, for instance) is based on the necessity to
ensure the exclusive enjoyment of a thing that cannot be shared: an
apple cannot be shared, if I eat it you will not eat it. But in the
digital age the status of goods has changed: immaterial goods are
semiotic stuff that is not annihilated by use. When it comes to
semiotic products private property becomes irrelevant, and in fact it
is more and more difficult to enforce it. The campaigns against piracy
are paradoxical because the real pirates are the corporations that are
desperately trying to privatize the product of the collective
intelligence, and artificially trying to impose a tax on the community
of producers. The products of collective intelligence are immanently
common because knowledge can neither be fragmented nor privately owned.
A new brand of communism was already springing from the technological
transformations of Digital Networks, when the collapse of the financial
markets and Neoliberal Ideology exposed the frailty of the foundations
of hyper-capitalism. Now we can predict a new wave of transformation
from the current collapse of Growth and Debt, and of private
consumption as well-being. Because of these three forces &#8211; commonality
of knowledge, ideological crisis of private ownership, mandatory
communalisation of Need - a new horizon is visible and a new landscape
is going to surface. Communism is coming back. </p>
                  <p>The
old face of Communism, based on the Will and voluntarism of an avant
garde, and on the paranoid expectations of a New Totality was defeated
at the end of the 20th century and will never resurrect. A totally new
brand of communism is going to surface as a form of necessity, the
inevitable outcome of the stormy collapse of the capitalist system. The
communism of capital is a barbarian necessity. We must put freedom in
this necessity, we need to make of this necessity a conscious organised
choice. </p>
                  <p>Communism is back, but we should
name it in a different way because historical memory identified this
particular form of social organization with the political tyranny of a
Religion. The historical communism of the 20th century was based on the
idea of the primacy of Totality over Singularity. But the dialectical
framework that defined the Communist movement of the 20th century has
been completely abandoned and nobody will ever be able to resurrect it.
</p>
                  <p>The Hegelian ascendance played a major role
in the formation of that kind of religious belief that was labelled
'historicism'. The <em>Aufhebung </em> (abolition of the real in favor
of the realization of the Idea) is the paranoid background of the whole
conceptualization of communism. Inside that dialectical framework
Communism was viewed as an all encompassing totality expected to
abolish and follow the capitalist all encompassing totality. The
subject (the will and action of the working class) was viewed as the
instrument for the abolition of the old and the instauration of the
New. </p>
                  <p><strong>6. Singularities</strong></p>
                  <p>The
industrial working class, being external to the production of concepts,
could only identify with the mythology of Abolition and Totalization,
but the general intellect cannot do that. The general intellect is like
the fish of Iggy Pop: &#8220;The fish is mute expressionless, because the
fish knows. Everything.&#8221; </p>
                  <p>The general
intellect does not need an expressive subject, like the Leninist Party
was in the 20th century. The political expression of the General
Intellect is at one with its action of knowing, creating, and producing
signs. We have abandoned the ground of Dialectics in favour of the
plural grounds of the Dynamic of singularization and the multilayered
co-evolution of singularities. Capitalism is over, but it is not going
to disappear. The creation of Non Temporary Autonomous Zones is not
going to give birth to any totalization. We are not going to witness a
cathartic event of Revolution, we'll not see the sudden breakdown of
State power. During the next months and years we'll witness a sort of
Revolution without a Subject. In order to subjectivate this revolution
we have to proliferate singularities. This, in my humble opinion, is
our cultural and political task. </p>
                  <p>After
abandoning the field of the Dialectics of Abolition and Totalization,
we are now trying to build a Theory of the Dynamics of recombination
and singularization, a concept that is clearly drawn from the works of
Felix Guattari, particularly from his last book, <em>Chaosmose </em>.
Singularity does not mean &#8220;individual&#8221;, because you can have collective
singularities. By the world singularity I mean an agency that does not
follow any rule of conformity and repetition, and is not framed in any
historical necessity. Singularity is a process that is not necessary,
because it is implied in the consequentiality of history neither
logically nor materially. </p>
                  <p><strong>7. Unending process of therapy </strong></p>
                  <p>Rather
than a swift change in the social landscape, we should expect the slow
surfacing of new trends: communities abandoning the field the crumbling
ruling economies, more and more individuals giving up their search for
a job and creating their own networks of services. </p>
                  <p>The
dismantling of the industry is unstoppable for the simple reason that
social life does not need industrial labour anymore. The myth of Growth
is going to be abandoned and people will look for new modes of wealth
distribution. Singular communities will transform the very perception
of well-being and wealth in the sense of frugality and freedom. The
cultural revolution that we need in this transition leads from the
perception of wealth as the private ownership of a growing amount of
goods that we cannot enjoy because we are too busy purchasing the money
needed for acquisition, to the perception of wealth as the enjoyment of
an essential amount of things that we can share with other people. </p>
                  <p>The
de-privatization of services and goods will be made possible by this
much needed cultural revolution. This will not happen in a planned and
uniformed way, this will rather be the effect of the withdrawal of
singular individuals and communities, and the result of the creation of
an economy of shared use of common goods and services and the
liberation of time for culture, pleasure and affection. While this
process expands at the margins of society, the criminal class will hang
on to its power and enforce more and more repressive legislation, the
majority of people will be increasingly aggressive and desperate.
Ethnic civil war will spread all over Europe, wrecking the very fabric
of civil life. </p>
                  <p>The proliferation of
singularities (the withdrawal and building of non temporary autonomous
zones) will be a pacific process, but the conformist majority will
react violently, and this is already happening. The conformist majority
is frightened by the fleeing away of intelligent energy and
simultaneously is attacking the expression of intelligent activity. The
situation can be described as a fight between the Mass Ignorance
produced by Media-totalitarianism and the shared Intelligence of the
General Intellect. </p>
                  <p>We cannot predict what
the outcome of this process will be. Our task is to extend and protect
the field of autonomy, and to avoid as much as possible any violent
contact with the field of aggressive mass Ignorance. This strategy of
non confrontational withdrawal will not always succeed. Sometimes
confrontation will be made inevitable by racism and fascism. What has
to be done in the case of unwanted conflict is not foreseeable. Non
violent reaction is obviously the best choice, but it will not always
be possible. The identification of well-being with private property is
so deeply rooted that a barbarization of the human environment cannot
be completely ruled out. But the task of the general intellect is
exactly this: fleeing from paranoia, creating zones of human
resistance, experimenting autonomous forms of production based on
high-tech-low-energy production &#8211; whilst avoiding confrontation with
the criminal class and the conformist population. </p>
                  <p>Politics
and therapy will be one and the same activity in the coming time.
People will feel hopeless and depressed and panicking, because they are
unable to deal with the post-growth economy, and because they will miss
the dissolving modern identity. Our cultural task will be attending to
those people and taking care of their insanity, showing them the way of
a happy adaptation at hand. Our task will be the creation of social
zones of human resistance that act like zones of therapeutic contagion.
The process of autonomisation has not to be seen as a <em>Aufhebung </em>,
but as Therapy. In this sense it is not totalizing and intended to
destroy and abolish the past. Like psychoanalytic therapy it is rather
to be considered as an unending process. </p>
