<h1>Dane</h1>
<h2>&#xA9; 2006 by Will Holcomb</h2>

<pre>The paths through the heart
<span class="indented">are twisted and torn.</span>
Ways are cleared slowly
<span class="indented">and covered in a moment of carelessness.</span>
No one travels here with understanding;
<span class="indented">to love is to be lost.</span></pre>

<pre>It surprises me to find myself here
<span class="indented">where the touch of your hand draws me</span>
<span class="indented">as much as the press of your body.</span>
I'd thought myself beyond this:
<span class="indented">too battered and world-weary</span>
<span class="indented">for these dreams of children and fools.</span>
My dabblings in romance have become
<span class="indented">things planned in the head</span>
<span class="indented">and played out quite a bit lower.</span></pre>

<pre>But there's no queen's pawn to K7 here.
<span class="indented">No check. No mate. No control.</span>
I turn to you with all the thought
<span class="indented">of a flower to the sun.</span></pre>

<pre>Though we live far from the real world
<span class="indented">this is no fairy tale.</span>
I'm no prince and you no maiden fair.
Here, love is conquered
<span class="indented">by past hurts, future plans, distance,</span>
<span class="indented">and time ever short.</span>
Here, love struck, as often as not,
<span class="indented">doesn't make for love striking.</span>
Here, the need for a touch of home
<span class="indented">can change a person.</span></pre>

<pre>These things I know.
These things I accept.
I'd sooner set myself against the tides
<span class="indented">as try to change your heart.</span></pre>
