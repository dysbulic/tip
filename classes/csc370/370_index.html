<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00EE00">Project:</FONT></B> Implement a Unimation Puma
600, an
industrial robot with six revolute joints, in three dimensions.  

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00EE00">Purpose:</FONT></B> This project has several
different possibilities. One feature that can be implemented after the
initial design is allowing a robotic arm that dropped an object to be able
to retrieve it from the factory floor.  This added feature would allow
modeling of a control system with a higher fault tolerance than we are
currently working with. Another advantage of this application would be
that it could serve as a tool for teaching people factory design and as a
way to test the efficiency of different factory layouts.  Another option
that this application could incorporate would be to include in the
database information about how different parts fit together.  This would
essentially lead to an intelligent factory that would be able to assemble
different products correctly.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#00EE00">Progress:</FONT></B> The factory floor for the
first version of the project will have the robotic arm at a fixed
location; further versions of the project will have robotic arms that a
user will be drag-and-drop from the object palette.  This project was
based off a two-dimensional model that was created in fall 1998 by Lewis
Baumstark, Michael Sandt, and Andy Trent.

<P>Our groups meets twice a week as a group and other times as needed.
Once on Wednesdays at 2:00 pm with Dr. Ramaswamy and once on Sundays at
6:00. <A HREF="370_status.html">View our status reports.</A>
