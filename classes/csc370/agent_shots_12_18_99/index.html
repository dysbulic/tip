<a href="./DrawTest.html">Alpha edition</a>: This program will run as an applet under Netscape witht he Java plugin installed. It causes IE 5 to crash though this seems to be a java plugin issue and not one with the program itself. This edition of the program is having trouble with the intersection testing in the virtual world (I was having to try different algorithms because the ones that I used were too processor intensive.) So currently the agents run over each other.
