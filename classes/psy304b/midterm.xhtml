          <p>A researcher is interested in comparing the efficacy of 3 alternative treatments for speech anxiety. Treatment #1 is behavior therapy (BT), treatment #2 is the beta-adrenergic blocker Atenolol (AT), and treatment #3 is placebo (PL). Out of a total sample size of 30, 12 patients are randomly assigned to the BT group, 12 patients are randomly assigned to the AT group, and 6 patients are randomly assigned to the PL group. The primary dependent measure is an overall rating of public speaking ability conducted by trained raters who are experts in non-verbal aspects of public speaking. These ratings were made on a 0 to 10 scale, with higher scores indicating better public speaking. The ratings for each group are shown below:</p>

That is, make up a story about features of the study that I have not told you about that would plausibly result in a violation of the independence of errors assumption. Is it likely that your violation scenario would result in an increase in Type-I errors or an increase in Type-II errors (ie., decreased power) if a one-way ANOVA were still performed on these data?

              <p>The assumption of independence applies both within and between groups. When there are correlations within the data this will cause the data to stratify into groups in a manner the ANOVA is not designed to account for.

              <p>The effects of violating the assumption of independence depends on whether the violation is within or between groups. In the previous example, imagine that the researcher chose the mental health facility associated with his university. Unbeknownst to the researcher, that particular facility has a reputation within the community of classical Shakespearean actors of the world as the premier establishment for dealing with stage fright.</p>
              <p>Subjects were collected through responses to fliers posted in the facility. All the respondents are actors, and there are two classes of people who responded: aspiring actors too nervous to get on stage and established actors looking to iron out their craft. This division can be seen to some extent in the placebo group where individuals were either much better than average or completely inept.</p>
              <p>It turns out that some of the characteristics that influence a person's decision to perform Shakespeare on the public stage also affect their response to different types of therapies. The response to drug therapies is like the general population, but there is a positive correlation between being a Shakespearean actor and responding well to behavioral therapy. This means that for this study there is a positive <em>&rho;<sub>w</sub></em> for the behavioral therapy, but <em>&rho;<sub>b</sub></em> = 0.</p>
              <p>A positive <em>&rho;<sub>w</sub></em> will drive up the expected value of the MSB and reduce the MSW. This will increase the ratio of the two and create an inflated F-value with an increased likelihood of rejection. This means that the probability of incorrect rejection (Type 1 error) is no longer simply based on sampling error, and is greater than &alpha;.</p>
              <p>Between group correlations, <em>&rho;<sub>b</sub></em>, only increase the MSB, and will reduce the F-value. This reduces the probability of rejecting and the power of the test.</p>

            <div class="answer">
              <p>Heterogeneity of variances is particularly detrimental to the ANOVA when paired with unequal sample sizes. The exact effects depend on the variances:</p>

                A scaled version of the contrast is a form of a z-score and, if the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: &Psi; = 0, is true, will have a t-distribution. The <acronym title="Mean Square Within">MSW</acronym> is generally used as the estimate for

                and so the degrees of freedom is N - J (the dof for the MSW). The MSW uses the entire sample population for its estimate rather than simply the specific sample groups involved in the contrast. This is how a two group contrast varies from a simple t-test. The t-test only uses the two populations to compute the estimate of the variance.

                For this particular example however, we do not have access to actual sample data. The data has already been aggregated into means and variances. A pooled estimate of the variance then is:

                This quantity is equivalent to the MSW.

          <p>A social psychologist is interested in assessing the effects of five different types of feedback on nonverbal expressiveness in a social interaction task. Five experimental conditions are used (denoted below as A-E). Subjects are randomly assigned to groups with n = 20 per group. In the questions below, try to give a precise probability value for the familywise Type 1 error rate. If you cannot give a precise value, give a range estimate (i.e., if X is the familywise Type 1 error rate, something like L &le; X &le; U, where L and U are specific probability values). Assume that all comparisons are two-tailed.</p>

              <p>Let’s assume that the researcher wants to do the three comparisons listed in part b. above. Let’s say that the population means for A-E are actually as follows: A = 5, B = 5, C = 5, D = 10, E = 5. The experimenter uses a per comparison type 1 error rate of &alpha; = .10. What would be the familywise type 1 error rate for this set of contrasts? (10)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A Type I error is an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis. Since the mean of D is in reality different than the other means, rejecting H<sub>0</sub> for <em>&Psi;</em><sub>1</sub> is <em>correct</em>. This means there was no error. If there is an error, it will be a Type II error because the test should have rejected. The error rate, &alpha;, is not concerned with Type II error rates however.</p>
              <p>So, there are only two contrasts which can incorrectly reject because of sampling errors: <em>&Psi;</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>&Psi;</em><sub>3</sub>. These two comparisons are not orthogonal, so their error rates can only be bounded:</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, R does not include a built-in method for performing the Scheffe test. For this reason it was necessary to implement it in R based largely on an adaptation for the code for the Tukey test. While the process was certainly educational, it was ultimately off, by what I'm fairly certain is a constant factor (probably of a half). Class started 5 minutes ago though, so I'll have to find this problem at some later time.</p>

              <p>From the previously computed minimum mean differences of the Tukey and Scheffe, it is known that pairs with a mean difference of more than 4.99 and 5.44 respectively should reject. S-/P- v S+/P+ has a mean difference of 6.125 and so both should reject it. There are no mean differences in the range (4.99, 5.44) so there should be no difference in the rejections.</p>

            <div class="answer">
              <p>Given that there are a small number of a priori comparisons, Bonferroni is an acceptable mutiplicity error correction method. For a small number of pairwise comparisons, Bonferroni should give a better familywise error than Tukey.</p>

              <p>A researcher conducts a study with four experimental conditions. Initially, she intended to conduct all pairwise comparisons. After looking at the data, she decides that only one of the comparisons is likely to be significant, so she conducts that single comparison. (5)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Because the a priori decision was to examine all pairwise contrasts, the researcher is limited to Tukey even though the actual ad hoc comparisons would have more power if Bonferroni was conducted. Because only pairwise comparisons were considered initially, it is not necessary to employ Sheffe.</p>

              <p>Because there are only three conditions, the most powerful correction method will be the Fisher <a href="Least Significant Difference">LSD</a>.</p>
              <p>Fisher LSD is a qualification-based test. An ANOVA is performed on the data at the &alpha; Type I error rate. If the ANOVA rejects then any number of comparisons are performed, also at the &alpha; Type I error rate. The idea is that the ANOVA bounds the error for the entire data set at &alpha;. Data with genuinely equivalent means will fail the ANOVA &alpha;(100)% of the time.</p>
              <p>The issue with the Fisher LSD is, consider an experiment with <em>k</em> conditions which have actually identical means. Imagine the experimenter would like to run the set of <em>k</em> - 1 orthogonal contrasts on the data. The error rate for this set of contrasts will be 1 - (1 - &alpha;)<sup><em>k</em> - 1</sup>. Using the Fisher LSD to correct could bound this error to &alpha;, but only because all the means are equivalent.</p>
              <p>Consider the situation where the null hypothesis is partially true. Add a new condition which has a genuine difference in mean of large magnitude from the previous <em>k</em> equivalent conditions. This is called a "partial null" as opposed to a "complete null" where all the means are equal. This new condition will cause the ANOVA to consistently reject, and the previous <em>k</em> conditions are essentially run without any error correction.</p>
              <p>The Fisher LSD is a permissible correction for a three condition experiment simply because the two groups that might have been passed by a partial null will simply be run against each other where it is appropriate to use an &alpha; type I error rate.</p>
