          <h3>Comparing Multiple Search Methods</h3>
          <p>Consider the problem of finding a path in the grid shown below from starting square S to goal square G. Possible moves from a square are: move up, move left, move right, and move down exactly one square. No move may be made onto a dark square (i.e., obstacles), or off the edge of the grid.</p>

Assume you do not generate a node if that node's associated grid position has previously been generated. (That is, the third way to deal with repeated states as described on pages 81-82.) In the case of ties in evaluation function values, for siblings expand them in the precedence order up, left, right, down. In the case of ties between non-siblings, use FIFO order to expand first the node that has been in the NODES list the longest.

                <li>Depth-First &mdash; Will not find a solution. Once the search comes around the edge of the cells blocking a straight path, it will go up and continue to go up indefinitely.</li>
                <li>Iterative Deepening Depth-First &mdash; Will find a solution. The search order is the same as breadth-first search and a path will be found for the same reason.</li>
                <li>Greedy Best-First &mdash; Will find a solution if the heuristic is always positive. As the costs accumulate with increasing distance from the start, eventually the search will be driven to the goal.</li>
                <li>A* &mdash; Will find a solution for the same reason as Greedy Best-First.</li>

            <li>h1 &mdash; Number of misplaced tiles</li>

              <p>Are all three heuristics admissible? Are they consistent (monotonic)? Either prove your conclusions for the general case or give a counterexample.</p>

            <div class="answer">
              <ol>
                <li>h1 &mdash; To get each misplaced tile into its correct position will take at least one move, so this will never be more than the minimum distance to the goal and is thus monotonic. A* when performed with a monotonic heuristic is admissible because it explores pathes in order of increasing length.</li>
                <li>h2 &mdash; The minimum number of moves to get from some position &lt;i<sub>1</sub>,j<sub>1</sub>&gt; to some other position &lt;i<sub>2</sub>,j<sub>2</sub>&gt; is the Manhattan diistance, so this heuristic is monotonic and A* is admissible.</li>
                <li>h3 &mdash; There are boards where only a single tile is out of place and only a single move is needed. Since h3 has a constant of 2 added and h2 cannot be negative, its minimum value is at least 2. Since it will overestimate the distance in these cases it is not monotonic and A* would not be admissible.</li>

              <ol>
                <li>h1 &mdash; The maximum value of this heuristic is 8 if all 8 tiles are misplaced. This offers realtively small granularity and does not take into account the distance the tile is misplaced. This heuristic is not terrible well informed.</li>
                <li>h2 &mdash; This heuristic has a larger range and takes into account the amount is disorder in the board. It is better informed than h2.</li>
                <li>h3 &mdash; It is more informed than h2 because it has a greater range and takes into account tile reversals.</li>

              <p>A* is constantly expanding the shortest projected path to the goal. It is admissible if the heuristic function always underestimates the distance to the goal because a path <em>p</em> is only completed when the goal node is at the head of the open queue. <em>P</em> can only be at the head of the queue if it has a cost + heuristic less than or equal to any other node. If there were another goal cheaper than <em>p</em>, it would come up first.</p>
              <p>There has to always be an item from <em>p</em> on the open list because the open list has the heads of the lowest cost paths from the start. One of those has to be a subpath of the lowest cost path to the goal.</p>

                        <p>It would depend on the length of the word list.
