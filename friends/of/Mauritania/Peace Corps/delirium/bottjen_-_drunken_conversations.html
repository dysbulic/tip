    <h1>Drunken Conversations</h1>
    <h3>Audbot</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>I can't remember what I'm supposed to write about. It was deep,
    I know. Something profound. Probably would have changed your
    lives. Enlightenment would have started right here in Mauritania,
    spreading (through Peace Corps channels originally, later more
    conventional media) across the world. I have faith in this, even
    though I have no idea what it was I promised I would write. I
    remember clearly the several friendly rounds of vodka-fanta…and
    somewhat more dimly the promise I made to write something for
    Delirium. The brilliant theory I was going to explain, however, is
    sadly lost forever. Was I going to tackle the thermo-dynamics of
    the soul? Find the fulcrum in the balance of good and evil in the
    universe? Tell you how many licks it takes to get to the center of
    a Tootsie Pop (and why you should care)? The world may never
    know.</p>

    <p>I would truly like to share whatever great truth it was that
    inspired me that night, but like a UFO, the drunken conversation
    descended, carried us all away for a while, then dropped us off in
    the same place, with no memory of the event--standard operating
    procedure for drunken conversations. You wake up feeling a little
    worse for wear, with a vague sentiment that something slightly
    momentous and slightly invasive happened the night before.
    Shiftily make eye contact with the other abductees &mdash; what do
    they remember? What are you forgetting? Does anyone know how that
    vomit got in the bike room? And then the call comes 2 weeks later
    &mdash; "How's that piece for Delirium coming?"</p>

    <p>Rather than try to recreate those Deep Thoughts from the
    drunken conversation, I am going to delve into the root of them.
    There is a tendency to demonize drunken conversations &mdash; I'm
    going to avoid that. There probably is not a tendency to idealize
    them, but I'll avoid that too, just in case. They hold lessons;
    you can examine them in a Freudian light, interpreting them as you
    would dreams or Rorschach ink blots, cloudy reflections of inner
    desires and fears. They also hold perils, largely the risk of
    making a real ass of yourself, but we're all well aware of that
    and I'm not here to preach. Drunken conversations hold many risks
    and side-effects; they're not always fun. But in a life where,
    either because of cultural differences or language difficulties,
    you seldom express yourself, the conversations cleanse you,
    flushing out emotions and other strange inner movements grown
    crusty and barnacled through the stagnant waters of repression. To
    put it bluntly (in a metaphor I'd never use outside of a Peace
    Corps publication) drunken conversations are the diarrhea to the
    emotional constipation imposed by lack of acceptable outlets.</p>

    <p>As PCMOs the world over will tell you, until you're in danger
    of dehydration, diarrhea is the solution, not the problem. The
    problem starts much earlier, with the amoebas, giardia, bad food….
    diarrhea is the body's appropriate response. As a responsible
    guardian of your body, it is your duty to keep drinking liquids
    until all the problems are washed away. The same is true for
    drunken conversations. As with diarrhea, they can be avoided with
    careful monitoring of everything you ingest. If, however, you are
    not careful enough, it can strike with absolutely no warning. It's
    the unreliability that makes it all the more dangerous. You aren't
    seized by diarrhea every time you drink unfiltered water, and you
    aren't seized by drunken conversation every time you drink
    alcohol. Instead, it craftily waits for the best possible moment
    to possess you with its undeniable urge.</p>

    <p>Relieving, embarrassing, at times disturbing and smelly,
    drunken conversations are always better when they're shared
    experiences. The convenience of not having to compete for the
    bathroom, or center of attention, is far outweighed by the
    awkwardness of every new disclosure emanating from you and you
    alone. The relief at letting it all out is completely overshadowed
    by the look in everyone else's eyes; amusement and concern at
    best, but more often barely disguised disgust. Though on some
    level you know you are making a scene, a situation, a fool of
    yourself, your inability to stop leaves you feeling helpless and
    vulnerable. In contrast, when you are in like company, compassion
    and understanding is mirrored in all eyes you see. Common victims
    of the same affliction, common voyagers on the same journey, my
    stink is your stink, your destination is my destination.</p>

    <p>But to be precise, a one-person drunken conversation is
    actually not even a conversation, just a drunken monologue,
    usually lying somewhere along the spectrum between heartbreakingly
    honest and touching to completely pathetic. A true drunken
    conversation requires at least two individuals and this is where
    the magic enters. Somewhere in the shared experience arises
    something transcendental, something that rises above normal
    understanding. Yes, understanding. Comprehension. Compassion.
    Everyone say it together, "I love you guys, I mean it, you're the
    best."</p>

    <p>Exacerbating this tendency are the communication and cultural
    barriers between Peace Corps volunteers and those in their
    communities. Does anyone in your village really appreciate your
    confidence that Ben and Jennifer will get back together or share
    your apprehension about taking the GREs? Do they have any clue
    what the Chicago Cub's prospects are for next year or how it feels
    to know your favorite Chinese restaurant closed down during (and
    possibly because of) your absence. Not likely, and the
    understanding born of a drunken conversation is all the sweeter
    for that. We are thirsty for the empathy and unqualified
    acceptance we seldom find in our day to day lives.</p>

    <p>It is perhaps because the bond of comprehension is wrapped so
    tightly around drunken conversations that they sometimes reach
    staggering moral and intellectual depths. The riddles of the
    universe are often beyond the scope of the cognitive mind, but the
    complexities and the rhythms are all mirrored within our
    biological frames. Water, protein and glutinous mass that we are,
    we echo the universe in growth, decay, progression and the
    occasional spontaneous combustion. Our cognitive process, ordered
    by societal dictums, is necessarily constrained by the same
    society. Perhaps the utopian society would lead to the ideal
    thought mechanisms for solving the universe's problems, but in the
    absence of such, drunken conversation is our medium for regressing
    beyond socially-constructed niceties to more bare and basic
    truths. We say that drunks are out of control, but the key
    question here is out of whose control? The roar of the alcohol
    drowns out the whispered admonitions of an artificially-imposed
    conscience. The desire and ability to follow society's designs are
    submerged in the inchoate mist of our own selves. Blind and
    reactive, drunken conversations stumble along unfamiliar cognitive
    pathways, unsure of direction, destination or motive. There is
    only the sense that the truth is nearby, leading the conversation
    on, over rocky and uneven moral and intellectual grounds. At times
    dancing like will-o-wisps through the marsh, other times great
    searing blasts of revelation, or slowly and delicately spun like
    spider webs, answers and reflections of answers rise to the
    surface of consciousness. These answers, tenuous even at their
    most substantial, fade away as daylight doubts descend. The truth
    born of drunken conversations melts quietly, completely and
    unobtrusively, its passing unnoticed except through the emptiness
    it leaves. To reword Emily Dickinson, "And thus without a wing, or
    service of a keel, our drunken conversation makes its light escape
    into the beautiful."</p>

    <p>A final word of warning; do not attempt to follow or capture
    the drunken conversation. Its truths and its magic will not stand
    up to the harsh light of day. This is easily verifiable—next time
    you happen across one, grab a pen and paper and write down every
    statement dripping with truth and hilarity. Read it the next
    morning. It won't be funny. It won't be true. It will only be the
    corpse of a drunken conversation that should have been released
    hours ago. Like fish, drunken conversations belong in a very
    special medium, and when removed from that context stop breathing
    and start stinking. For their dignity and your own, enjoy them in
    their natural environment, learn from them, and then leaving no
    footprints, taking nothing with you, gracefully turn your back,
    pop some ibuprofen and get to work cleaning the vomit out of the
    bike room.</p>
