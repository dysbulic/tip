>You might not have rbash set up on your system. If you don't, just create a symlink to bash named rbash. This is a restricted shell and the user is not allowed to change directories or set the environment variables SHELL, PATH, ENV, or BASH_ENV. Also they can't run commands with a / in them, so setting their path to . and not allowing them to own their home directory fairly effectively limits them to only running the programs symlinked into their home directory (passwd, smbpasswd and cvs).</P
>
      <P
>Because the path is set to . the user cannot be allowed to write to her home directory, else she might put a new shell there and execute it. Also the directory and bash profile are set to immutable because even though they don't have access to the chmod command via a shell they can still change permissions via the windows filesharing. This box is intended only as a webserver and not for any other type of storage. There will be another computer running where they can have user accounts to learn on.</P
