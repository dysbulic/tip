    <p>I was bored today and the internet was broken so rather than
     going outside or exercising or something like that I tried to
     figure out how to remotely control <a
     href="http://www.xmms.org">XMMS</a>. It was an interesting
     project that touched on a couple different areas of system
     configuration useful otherwise, so I figured I'd record the
     process.</p>
    <p>I've got a Madrake box that has speakers, but which sits across
     the lab from the RedHat 9 server where I do my work. I want to be
     able to change songs and pause it when someone comes in without
     getting up.</p>
    <p>There is a useful program under Mandrake called
     <code>xmms-shell</code> that lets me do the normal forward and
     back that I can do using the xmms program directly, but also
     select specific entries in the playlist and load playlists and
     different things.</p>
    <p>It is a neat program and I wondered how it worked, so I ran
     <code>strace xmms-shell</code> to see. When I do a <code>jump
     10</code> I see a trace like this:</p>
<pre>
brk(0x807e000)                          = 0x807e000
socket(PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)         = 3
getuid32()                              = 503
geteuid32()                             = 503
setuid32(0x1f7)                         = 0
setreuid32(0x1f7, 0x1f7)                = 0
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_UNIX, path="/tmp/xmms_will.0"}, 110) = 0
write(3, "\1\0\t\0\0\0\0\0", 8)         = 8
read(3, "\1\0\0\0\4\0\0\0", 8)          = 8
read(3, "c\0\0\0", 4)                   = 4
read(3, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8)          = 8
close(3)                                = 0
socket(PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)         = 3
getuid32()                              = 503
geteuid32()                             = 503
setuid32(0x1f7)                         = 0
setreuid32(0x1f7, 0x1f7)                = 0
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_UNIX, path="/tmp/xmms_will.0"}, 110) = 0
write(3, "\1\0\10\0\4\0\0\0", 8)        = 8
write(3, "\t\0\0\0", 4)                 = 4
read(3, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8)          = 8
close(3)                                = 0
write(1, "Jumped to position 10 in the pla"..., 39Jumped to position 10 in the playlist.) = 39
</pre>
    <p>It turns out that the important lines are these two:</p>
<pre>
write(3, "\1\0\10\0\4\0\0\0", 8)        = 8
write(3, "\t\0\0\0", 4)                 = 4
</pre>
    <p>The following perl code will cause xmms to jump to a song:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use Socket;

my $path = "/tmp/xmms_will.0";

my $num = shift || die "enter num";

socket(XMMS, PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0) or die "socket: $!";
connect(XMMS, sockaddr_un($path)) or die "open: $path: $!";
syswrite(XMMS, "\1\0\10\0\4");
syswrite(XMMS, pack("C4", $num - 1));
close(XMMS);
</pre>
    <p>I could go through and reverse engineer the codes for each
     command and write little scripts like the one above. This would
     be time consuming though and if the program changed versions the
     codes could well change.</p>
    <p>Another option is to use the xmms-shell program which can take
     scripts on the command line like <code>xmms-shell -e "jump
     23"</code>. I like this idea more since it is more likely to last
     over time. The one drawback is xmms-shell isn't widley
     distributed and so it wouldn't work on other systems.</p>
    <p>I think the idea I like the best is doing it programatically.
     XMMS includes functions that can be seen with <code>nm
     /usr/lib/libxmms.a | grep remote</code>. Calling those functions
     without writing a C program is a bit of a pain though. I think I
     want to do the interface through a scripting language...</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the computer I am working on has no development
     tools at all installed, so even though I there is a <a
     href="http://search.cpan.org/~dougm/Xmms-Perl-0.12/">XMMS
     interface</a> module for perl, when I do <code>perl -MCPAN -e
     'install xmms'</code> it fails because there is no C compiler and
     none of the header files for perl.</p>
    <p>Because my goal was to do as few modifications as possible to
     the box I will stich with xmms-shell.</p>
    <p>The setup that I want is to have my numeric keypad work in bash
     like it does for winamp. That is:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><div>7</div><div>seek backward 5 seconds</div><div>not
         possible with xmms-shell</div></td>
        <td><div>8</div><div>increase volume
         5%</div><div>upvoulme</div></td>
        <td><div>9</div><div>seek forward 5 seconds</div><div>not
         possible with xmms-shell</div></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><div>4</div><div>next song</div><div>next (only possible
         to do next song in order; no shuffle)</div></td>

        <td><div>6</div><div>previous song</div><div>next (only

      </tr>
      <tr>

         5%</div><div>downvolume</div></td>
        <td><div>3</div><div></div></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
