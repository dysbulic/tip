    <h1>Restructing Data Files</h1> <p>Back when I worked for <a
    href="http://www.mil-tec.com">Miltec</a>, we were doing using huge
    (10-20mb) space separated data files to drive visualizations. The
    data coming from various sensors would vary in the order that it
    recorded yaw, pitch and roll and since the data files had no
    headers, it worked best to simply run them through a preprocessor
    to put them in a uniform order. This is that program. I got fancy
    and added some options. I don't really remember how to run <a
    href="restructure.pl">this program</a>. Here's the help
    though:</p>

    <pre>restructures a ascii text file which is delineated into columns
 separated by spaces or columns.

-r "[colnum[:tranform]]+" -> restructure
  colnum = column number for the output file
  transform = factor to transform the output by

  exe: -r "3:10 4 5 1:.01 3" would generate an output with the 3rd, 4th,
   5th, 1st and 3rd columns of the input with each element of the first
   3rd column multiplied by 10 and each element of the original 1st
   column (the 4th in the output) multiplied by .01.

-p -> pad

  exe: -p would generate output columns padded to the length of the
   longest element in the column

-d "separator" -> output column separator; default: " "

-i "filename" -> input filename

-s "rexex" -> input separator regex; default: ",\s+"

-x -> xmlize

  exe: -> -x would generate output of the form:
   &lt;data name="dataname">
     &lt;column name="colname">
       &lt;point index="1">123456&lt;/point>
       &lt;point index="2">123456&lt;/point>
     &lt;/column>
     &lt;column name="colname">
     &lt;/column>
   &lt;/data>

-n "dataname" -> title for the data

 exe: -n "2001Earnings" would put the string 2001Earnings as the name
  property for the xml output or would use the table 2001Earnings as
  the table to insert into in the database.

-b "[user][:pass]@[hostname][/dbname]" -> insert columns into database url

  exe: will:mypass@localhost/samples will insert the columns into the
   table specified by -n; the table must already be created and have
   column names matching the columns of the input.

-h -> help</pre>
