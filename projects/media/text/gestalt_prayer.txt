                           I do my thing
                       and you do your thing
                     I am not in this world to
                          live up to your
                         expectations, and
                     you are not in this world
                        to live up to mine.
                       You are you and I am I
                        and if by chance we
                          find each other
                          it's beautiful.

                           (Perls, 1976)
