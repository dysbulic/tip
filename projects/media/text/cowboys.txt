 Three cowboys are sitting around a campfire, out on the lonesome prairie
 each with the bravado for which cowboys are famous.  A night of tall tales
 begins.
 
 The first says, "I must be the meanest, toughest cowboy there is.  Why, just
 the other day, a bull got loose in the corral and gored six men before I
 wrestled it to the ground, by the horns, with my bare hands."
 
 The second can't stand to be bested.  "Why that's nothing.  I was walking
 down the trail yesterday and a fifteen foot rattler slid out from under a
 rock and made a move for me.  I grabbed that snake with my bare hands, bit its
 head off, and sucked the poison down in one gulp. And I'm still here today."
 
 The third cowboy remained silent, slowly stirring the coals with his penis.
