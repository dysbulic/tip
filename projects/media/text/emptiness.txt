		     Subhuti and the Flower Shower

     Subhuti was Buddha's disciple. He was able to understand the
potency of emptiness, that nothing exists except in its
relationship of subjectivity and objectivity. One day, in a mood of
sublime emptiness, Subhuti was resting underneath a tree when
flowers began to fall about him.

     "We are praising you for your discourse on emptiness," the gods
whispered to Subhuti.

     "But I have not spoken of emptiness," replied Subhuti.

     "You have not spoken of emptiness, we have not heard emptiness,"
responded the gods. "This is the true emptiness." The blossoms
showered upon Subhuti as rain.
