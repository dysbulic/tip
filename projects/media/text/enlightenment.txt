                        Suiwo's Road to Enlightenment

     Suiwo, the disciple of Hakuin, was a good teacher. On a certain day
a certain pupil came to him, and Suiwo gave him the problem, "Hear the  
sound of one hand."
     
     The pupil remained three years, but could not pass the test. One
night he came to Suiwo in tears. "I must return to my home in shame," 
he said, "for I cannot solve the problem."

     "Wait another week," said Suiwo. "Meditate constantly." Still no
enlightenment came to the pupil. "Try for another week," said Suiwo. 
The pupil obeyed, but to no avail.

     "Still another week," requested Suiwo, but in vain. In despair the
pupil begged to be released, but Suiwo asked for one more meditation of 
five days. They too were without result. Then Suiwo said: "Mediate for 
three days longer. If you still fail to attain enlightenment, you had 
better kill yourself."

     On the second day the pupil was enlightened.
