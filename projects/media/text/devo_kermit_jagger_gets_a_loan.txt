A frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller. He can see from her
nameplate that the teller's name is Patricia Whack. So he says, "Ms.
Whack, I'd like to get a loan to buy a boat and go on a long
vacation."

Patti looks at the frog in disbelief and asks how much he wants to
borrow. The frog says $30,000. The teller asks his name and the frog
says that his name is Kermit Jagger and that it's OK, he knows the
bank manager.

Patti explains that $30,000 is a substantial amount of money and that
he will need to secure some collateral against the loan. She asks if
he has anything he can use as collateral.

The frog says, "Sure. I have this." And he produces a tiny pink
porcelain elephant, about half an inch tall. It's bright pink and
perfectly formed.

Very confused, Patti explains that she'll have to consult with the
manager; and disappears into a back office. She finds the manager and
reports: "There's a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to
know you, and he wants to borrow $30,000. And he wants to use this as
collateral."

She holds up the tiny pink elephant. "I mean, what the heck is this?"

So the bank manager looks back at her and says: "It's a knick knack,
Patti Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man's a Rolling Stone!"
