Subj:	committment quote by Goethe from the LT listserv

Until one is committed, there is hesitance, 
the chance to draw back, 
always ineffectiveness concerning 
all acts of initiative (and creation). 
There is one elementary truth, 
the ignorance of which kills 
countless ideas and splendid plans: 
that the moment one definitely commits oneself 
then Providence moves too. 
All sorts of things occur to help one 
that would never have otherwise occurred. 
A whole stream of events issue from the decision, 
rousing in one's favor
all matter of unforeseen incidents, 
meetings and material assistance, 
which no man would have dreamed 
could have come his way. 
Whatever you can do or dream, 
you can begin it. Boldness has genius, 
power and magic in it. Begin now.

		Goethe

This sounds like alot of stuff. I am reminded of the metagenic field
stuff that the Celestine Prophecy woman was talking about in the
workshop. Literally bringing things into being, it is a cool idea
though not one that I have much observation to support.

I think that in general, I don't need anything beyond the realm of my
ordinary experience to relate to what Goethe is saying. He is simply
noting the ways that committment shapes being and the way that being
shapes reality. I like the "Begin now" at the end.
