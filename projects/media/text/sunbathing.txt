A young lady on vacation headed for the deck of the hotel's roof for some sun. 
Since no one was around, she slipped off her bathing suit to get an overall
tan. Lying on her stomach, nearly asleep, she heard someone running up the
stairs and quickly grabbed a towel.
	"Excuse me, miss," the flustered hotel manager panted.  "The hotel
dosen't mind you sunning on the roof, but we would very much appreciate you
wearing your bathing suit."
	"What difference does it make? No one can see me up here."
	"Not quite true," said the embarrassed man.  "You're lying on the
dining room skylight."
