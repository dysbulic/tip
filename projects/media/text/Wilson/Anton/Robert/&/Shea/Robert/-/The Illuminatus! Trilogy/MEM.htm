<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">SOME READERS</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What was Mama Sutra's &quot;reading,&quot; where Danny Price-fixer
questioned her, actually all about? <i>Answer: </i>It had nothing to do with the
John F. Kennedy assassination, the <i>Confrontation </i>bombing, the Illuminati,
or any of the subjects it seemed to suggest, <i>except indirectly. </i>She had
aimed in the dark, and picked up bits and pieces of the old 'movie <i>Manhattan
Melodrama, </i>thusly:</p>
<p>• <i>District Attorney Wade </i>does not refer to the Dallas official who
first proclaimed Lee Harvey Oswald's guilt over TV; it refers to the character
played by William Powell in the movie.</p>
<p>• <i>Clark </i>does not refer to any of the Captain Clarks we have
encountered; it refers to Clark Gable, Mr. Powell's co-star. <i>The Ship is
sinking </i>does not refer to the Illuminati spider-ships, or the ship piloted
by Captain Clark; it refers to the <i>General Slocum, </i>as Mama guessed—the
sinking of this ship on June 15, 1904, is the first scene in the movie. 2422
does not refer to the dates of Oswald's and Kennedy's assassinations, or to the
old Wobbly address; it refers to a scene in the film where Gable, at a
racetrack, walks from box 24 to box 22 (box 23 is never shown, his body being
between it and the camera).</p>
<p><i>If I can't live as I please, let me die when I choose </i>is the last line
spoken by Clark Gable in the screenplay.</p>
<p>The fact that these phrases overlap certain themes in this novel (and in
Joyce's <i>Ulysses) </i>is either coincidence or synchronicity—take your
choice. <i>Manhattan Melodrama, </i>you might be interested to know, was playing
at the Biograph Theatre on the night of July 22, 1934, and was the last film
seen by the man who was shot outside and identified as John Herbert Dillinger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What was the Masonic signal of distress used by the grocer B. F. Morgan
when Dillinger tried to rob him in 1924? <i>Answer: </i>It consists in holding
your arms outward, bent upward 90 degrees at the elbow, and shouting, <i>&quot;Will
</i>nobody help the widow's son?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Is there really a secret passage beneath the Meditation Room in the UN
building?</p>
<p><i>Answer: </i>If so, we haven't been able to find it. Other spooky secrets
about that room, however, are revealed in <i>The Cult of the All-Seeing Eye, </i>by
Robert Keith Spencer (Christian Book Club of America, 1964).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. What was the <i>Erotion </i>of Adam Weishaupt mentioned by Hagbard in the
First Trip?</p>
<p><i>Answer: </i>The word translates, loosely, as &quot;love-in,&quot; and the
idea is basically the same. (See the books of Nesta Webster and John Robison
cited in the text.) <i>Now </i>do you believe in a conspiracy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Did Al Capone really help the FBI set up the man who was shot at the
Biograph Theatre on July 22, 1934? <i>Answer: </i>That's one of the more
plausible arguments in <i>Dillinger: Dead or Alive, </i>by Jay Nash and Ron
Offen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. If no animals were reported missing from local zoos, how is that Robert
Simpson of Kansas City was found dead with his throat torn as if by &quot;the
talons of some enormous beast?&quot;</p>
<p><i>Answer: </i>See the sequel, <i>The Homing Pigeons.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>7. </i>If Simon Moon majored in mathematics and was so obsessed with
numerology, why didn't he ever notice the most significant 23 in mathematical
history—the 23 definitions that open Euclid's <i>Geometry?</i></p>
<p><i>Answer: </i>Perhaps for the same reason that the road from Dayton, Ohio,
to New Lebanon, Ohio, was due <i>east </i>when Joe Malik drove it on June 25,
1969, but has always been due <i>west </i>on every day before and since then. Or
maybe by the same processes that allowed Joe to see a Salem commercial on his TV
set in the mid-1970s, although cigarette advertising was banned from television
in 1971.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Did Smiling Jim Trepomena achieve the fame he had sought?</p>
<p><i>Answer: </i>No. Dr. Vulcan Troll's definitive history of the Great Quake, <i>When
a State Dies, </i>mentions on page 123 that &quot;no American Eagle has since
been reported, and we can only assume that this species was another victim of
nature's mindless rampage on that tragic May 1.&quot; On page 369, Dr. Troll
mentions, among prominent casualties, &quot;The famous Cincinnati lawyer and
proponent of censorship James J. Trepomena.&quot; Neither he nor anyone else
ever connected the two occurrences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Where are the missing eight appendices? <i>Answer: </i>Censored.</p>
