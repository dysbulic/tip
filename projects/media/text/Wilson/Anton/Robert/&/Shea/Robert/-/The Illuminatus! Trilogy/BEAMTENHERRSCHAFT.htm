<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There came unto the High Chapperal one who had studied in the schools of the
Purple Sage and of the Hung Mung Tong and of the Illuminati and of the many
other schools; and this one had found no peace yet.</p>
<p>Yea: of the Discordians and the teachers of Mummu and of the Nazarene and of
the Buddha he had studied; and he had found no peace yet.</p>
<p>And he spake to the High Chapperal and said: Give me a sign, that I may
believe.</p>
<p>And the High Chapperal said unto him: Leave my presence, and seek ye the
horizon and the sign shall come unto you, and ye shall seek no more.</p>
<p>And the man turned and sought of the horizon; but the High Chapperal crept up
behind him and raised his foot and did deliver a most puissant kick in the man's
arse, which smarted much and humiliated the seeker grievously.</p>
<p>He who has eyes, let him read and understand.</p>
<p>—&quot;The Book of Grandmotherly Kindness,&quot; <i>The Dishonest Book of
Lies, </i>by Mordecai Malignatus, K.N.S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Starry Wisdom Church was not 00005's idea of a proper ecclesiastical shop
by any means. The architecture was a shade too Gothic, the designs on the
stained-glass windows a bit unpleasantly suggestive for a holy atmosphere
(&quot;My God, they must be bloody wogs,&quot; he thought), and when he opened
the door, the altar was lacking a proper crucifix. In fact, where the crucifix
should have been he found instead a design that was more than suggestive. It
was, in his opinion, downright tasteless.</p>
<p>Not High Church at all, Chips decided.</p>
<p>He advanced cautiously, although the building appeared deserted. The pews
seemed designed for bloody reptiles, he observed—a church, of course, should
be uncomfortable, that was good for the soul, but this was, well, gross. They
probably advertise in the kink newspapers, he reflected with distaste. The first
stained-glass window was worse from inside than outside; he didn't know who
Saint Toad was, but if that mosaic with his name on it gave any idea of Saint
Toad's appearance and predelictions, then, by God, no self-respecting Christian
congregation would ever think of sanctifying him. The next feller, a shoggoth,
was even less appetizing; at least they had the common decency not to canonize <i>him.</i></p>
<p>A rat scurried out from between two pews and ran across the center aisle,
right before Chip's feet.</p>
<p>Fair got on one's nerves, this place did.</p>
<p>Chips approached the pulpit and glanced up at the Bible. That was, at least,
one civilized touch. Curious as to what text might have been preached last in
this den of wogs, he scrambled up into the pulpit and scanned the open pages. To
his consternation, it wasn't the Bible at all. A lot of bragging and bombast
about some Yog Sothoth, probably a wog god, who was both the Gate and the
Guardian of the Gate. Absolute rubbish. Chips hefted the enormous volume and
turned it so he could read the spine. <i>Necronomicon, </i>eh? If his University
Latin could be trusted, that was something like &quot;the book of the names of
the dead.&quot; Morbid, like the whole building.</p>
<p>He approached the altar, refusing to look at the abominable design above it.
Rust—now what could one say of brutes who let their altar get rusty? He
scraped with his thumbnail. The altar was marble, <i>and marble doesn't rust. </i>A
decidedly unpleasant suspicion crossed his mind, and he tasted what his nail had
lifted. Blood. Fairly fresh blood.</p>
<p>Not High Church at all.</p>
<p>Chips approached the vestry, and walked into a web.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Damn,&quot; he muttered,
hacking at it with his flashlight—and something fell on his shoulder. He
brushed it off quickly and turned the light to the floor. It started to run up
his trouser leg and he brushed it off again, beginning to breathe heavily, and
stepped on it hard. There was a satisfactory snapping sound and he stomped again
to be sure. When he removed his shoe and turned the light down again, it was
dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A damned huge ugly brute of a spider.
Black gods, Saint Toads, rats, mysterious and heathenish capitalized Gates, that
nasty-looking shoggoth character, and now spiders. A buggering tarantula it
looked like, in fact. Next, Count Dracula, he thought grimly, testing the vestry
door. It slid open smoothly and he stepped back out of visible range, waiting a
moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">They were either not home or cool
enough to allow him the next move.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He stepped through the door and
flashed his light around.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, God, no,&quot; he said.
&quot;No. God, <i>no.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Good-bye, Mr. Chips,&quot; said
Saint Toad.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Did you ever take the underground
from Charing Cross to one of the suburbs? You know, that long ride without stops
when you're totally in the dark and everything seems to be rushing by outside in
the opposite direction? Relativity, the laboratory-smock people call it. In
fact, it was even more like going up a chimney than going forward in a tunnel,
but it was like both at the same time, if you follow me. Relativity. A
bitter-looking old man went by, dressed in turn-of-the-century Yankee clothing,
muttering something about &quot;Carcosa.&quot; An antique Pontiac car followed
him, with four Italians in it looking confused—it was slow enough for me to
spot the year, definitely 1936, and even to read the license plates, Rhode
Island AW-1472. Then a black man, not a Negro or a wog, but a really truly black
man, without a face and I'd hate to tell you what he had where the face should
have been. All the while, there was this bleating or squealing that seemed to
say &quot;Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!&quot; Another man, En</span>glish-looking but in
early 19th-century clothing; he looked my way, surprised, and said, &quot;I only
walked around the horses!&quot; I could sympathize: I only opened a bleeding
door. A giant beetle, who looked at me more intelligently than any bug I ever
saw before—he seemed to be going in a different direction, if there was
direction in this place. A white-haired old man with startling blue eyes, who
shouted &quot;Roderick Usher!&quot; as he flew by. Then a whole parade of
pentagons and other mathematical shapes that seemed to be talking to each other
hi some language of the past or the future or wherever they called home. And by
now it wasn't so much like a tunnel or even a chimney but a kind of roller
coaster with dips and loops but not the sort you find in a place like
Brighton—I think I saw this land of curve once, on a blackboard, when a class
in non-Euclidean geometry had used the room before my own class in Eng Lit Pope
to Swinb. and Neo-Raph. Then I passed a shoggoth or it passed me, and let me say
that their pictures simply do not do them justice: I am ready to go anywhere and
confront any peril on H.M. Service but I pray to the Lord Harry I never have to
get that close to one of those chaps again. Next came a jerk, or cusp is
probably the word: I recognized something: Ingolstadt, the middle of the
university. Then we were off again, but not for long, another cusp: Stonehenge.
A bunch of hooded people, right out of a Yank movie about the KKK, were busy
with some gruesome mummery right in the center of the stones, yelling
ferociously about some ruddy goat with a thousand young, and the stars were all
wrong overhead. Well, you pick up your education where you can—now I know,
even if I can't tell any bloody academic how I know, that Stonehenge is much
older than we think. Whizz, bang, we're off again, and now ships are floating
by—everything from old Yankee clippers to modern luxury liners, all of them
signaling the old S.O.S. semaphore desperately—and a bunch of airplanes
following in their wake. I realized that part must be the Bermuda Triangle, and
about then it dawned that the turn-of-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">the-century
Yank with the bitter face might be Ambrose Bierce. I still hadn't the foggiest
who all those other chaps were. Then along came a girl, a dog, a lion, a tin man
and a scarecrow. A real puzzler, that: was I visiting real places or just places
in people's minds? Or was there a difference? When the mock turtle, the walrus,
the carpenter and another little girl came along, my faith in the difference
began to crumble. Or did some of those writer blokes know how to tap into this
alternate world or fifth dimension or whatever it was? The shoggoth came by
again (or was it his twin brother?) and shouted, or I should say, gibbered,
&quot;Yog Sothoth Neblod Zin,&quot; and I could tell that was something
perfectly filthy by the tone of his voice. I mean, after all, I can take a queer
proposition without biffing the offender on the nose—one must be cosmopolitan,
you know—but I would vastly prefer to have such offers coming out of human
mouths, or at the very least out of mouths rather than orifices that shouldn't
properly be talking at all. But you would have to see a shoggoth yourself, God
forbid, to appreciate what I mean. The next stop was quite a refrigerator, miles
and miles of it, and that's where the creature who kept up that howling of
&quot;Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!&quot; hung his hat. Or its hat. I shan't attempt to
do him, or it, justice. That <i>Necronomicon </i>said about Yog Sothoth that
&quot;Kadath in the cold waste hath known him,&quot; and now I realized that
&quot;known&quot; was used there in the Biblical sense. I just hope he, or it,
stays in the cold waste. You wouldn't want to meet him, or it, on the Strand at
midday, believe me. His habits were even worse than his ancestry, and why he
couldn't scrape off some of the seaweed and barnacles is beyond me; he was
rather like Saint Toad in his</span><span style="font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">notions
of sartorial splendor and table etiquette, if you take my meaning. But I was off
again, the curvature was getting sharper and the cusps more frequent. There was
no mistaking the Heads where I arrived next: Easter Island. I had a moment to
reflect on how those Heads resembled Tla-loc and the lloigor of Fernando Poo and
then this kink's version of a Cook's Tour moved on, and there I was at the last
stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Damn, blast and thunder!&quot;
I said, looking at Mano-lete turning his veronica and Concepcion lying there
with her poor throat cut. &quot;Now that absolutely does tear it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I decided not to toddle over to the
Starry Wisdom Church this tune around. There is a limit, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Instead, I went out into Tequila y
Mota Street and approached the church but kept my distance, trying to figure
where BUGGER kept the Time Machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">While I was reflecting on that, I
heard the first pistol shot.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Then a volley.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The next thing I knew the whole
population of Fernando Poo—Cubans descended from the prisoners shipped there
when it was a penal colony in the 19th century, Spaniards from colonial days,
blacks, wogs, and whatnot—were on Tequila y Mota street using up all the
munitions they owned. It was the countercoup, of course—the Captain Puta crowd
who unseated Tequila y Mota and prevented the nuclear war—but I didn't know
that at the time, so I dashed into the nearest doorway and tried to duck the
flying bullets, which were coming, mind you, as thick as the darling buds in
May. It was hairy. And one Spanish bloke— gay as a tree full of parrots from
his trot and his carriage, goes by waving an old cutlass out of a book and
shouting, &quot;Better to die on our feet than to live on our
knees!&quot;—headed straightway into a group of Regular Army who had finally
turned out to try to stop this business. He waded right into them, cutting heads
like a pirate, until they shot him as full of holes as Auntie's drawers. That's
your Spaniards: even the queers have balls.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Well, this wasn't my show, so I
backed up, opened the door and stepped into the building. I just had a moment to
recognize <i>which </i>building I had picked, when Saint Toad gave me his
bilious eye and said, &quot;You again!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The trip was less interesting this
time (I had seen it before, after all) and I had time to think a bit and realize
that old frog-face wasn't using a Time Machine or any mechanical device at all.
Then I was in front of a pyramid—they missed that stop last time—and I
waited to arrive back in the Hotel Durrutti. To my surprise, when there was a
final jerk in the dimensions or whatever they were, I found myself someplace
else.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">00005, in fact, was in an enormous
marbled room deliberately designed to impress the bejesus out of any and all
visitors. Pillars reached up to cyclopean heights, supporting a ceiling too high
and murky to be visible, and every wall, of which there seemed to be five, was
the same impenetrable ivory-grained marble. The eyes instinctively sought the
gigantic throne, in the shape of an apple with a seat carved out of it, and made
of a flawless gold which gleamed the more brightly in the dim lighting; and the
old man who sat on the throne, his white beard reaching almost to the lap of his
much whiter robe, commanded attention when he spoke: &quot;If I may be
trite,&quot; he said in a resonant voice, &quot;you are welcome, my son.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">This still wasn't High Church, but it
was a definite improvement over the digs where Saint Toad and his loathsome
objets d'art festered. Still, 00005's British common sense was disturbed.
&quot;I say,&quot; he ventured, &quot;you're not some sort of mystic, are you? I
must tell you that I don't intend to convert to anything heathen.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Conversion, as you understand
it,&quot; the aged figure told him placidly, &quot;consists of pounding one's
own words into a man's ears until they start coming out of his mouth. Nothing is
of less interest to me. You need have no fear on that ground.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I see.&quot; 00005 pondered.
&quot;This wouldn't be Shangri-La or some such place, would it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;This is Dallas, Texas, my
son.&quot; The old man's eyes bore a slight twinkle although his demeanor
otherwise remained grave. &quot;We are below the sewers of Dealy Plaza, and I am
the Dealy Lama.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">00005 shook his head. &quot;I don't
mind having my leg pulled,&quot; he began.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I am the Dealy Lama,&quot; the
old man repeated, &quot;and this is the headquarters of the Frisian Liberation
Front.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;A joke's a joke,&quot; Chips
said, &quot;but how did you manage that frog-faced creature back in the Starry
Wisdom Church?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Tsathoggua? He is not managed
by us. We saved you from him, in fact Twice.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Tsathoggua?&quot; Chips
repeated. &quot;I thought the swine's name was Saint Toad.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;To be sure, that is one of his
names. When he first appeared, in Hyperborea, he was known as Tsathoggua, and
that is how he is recorded in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the <i>Necronomicon </i>and
other classics. The Atlantean high priests, Klarkash Ton and Lhuv Kerapht, wrote
the best descriptions of him, but their works have not survived, except in our
own archives.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You <i>do </i>put on a good
front,&quot; 00005 said sincerely. &quot;I suppose, fairly soon, you'll get
around to telling me that I have been brought here due to some karma or
other?&quot; He was actually wishing there were some place to sit down. No
doubt, it added to the Lama's dignity to sit while Chips had to stand, but.it
had been a hard night already and Ms feet hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes, I have many revelations
for you,&quot; the old man said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I was afraid of that. Isn't
there some place where I can bring my arse to anchor, as my uncle Sid would say,
before I listen to your wisdom? I'm sure it's going to be a long time in the
telling.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The old man ignored this. &quot;This
is the turning point in history,&quot; he said. &quot;All the forces of Evil,
dispersed and often in conflict before, have been brought together under one
sign, the eye in the pyramid. All the forces of Good have been gathered, also,
under the sign of the apple.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I see,&quot; 00005 nodded.
&quot;And you want to enlist me on the side of Good?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Not at all,&quot; the old man
cried, bouncing up and down in Ms seat with laughter. &quot;I want to invite you
to stay here with us while the damned fools fight it out aboveground.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">00005 frowned. &quot;That isn't a
sporting attitude,&quot; he said disapprovingly; but then he grinned. &quot;Oh,
I almost fell for it, didn't I? You <i>are </i>pulling my leg!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I am telling you the
truth,&quot; the old man said vehemently. &quot;How do you suppose I have lived
to this advanced age? By running off to join in every idiotic barroom brawl,
world war, or Armageddon that comes along? Let me remind you of the street where
we picked you up; it is entirely typical of the proceedings during the Kali
Yuga. Those imbeciles are using live ammunition, son. Do you want me to tell you
the secret of longevity, lad—my secret? I have lived so outrageously long
because,&quot; he spoke with deliberate emphasis, &quot;I don't give a fuck for
Good and Evil.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I should be ashamed to say so,
if I were you,&quot; Chips replied coolly. &quot;If the whole world felt like
you, we'd all be a sorry kettle of fish.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Very well,&quot; the old man
started to raise an arm. &quot;I'll send you back to Saint Toad.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Wait!&quot; Chips stirred
uneasily. &quot;Couldn't you send me to confront Evil in one of its, ah, more
human forms?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Aha,&quot; the old man sneered.
&quot;You want the lesser Evil, is it? Those false choices are passing away,
even as we speak. If you want to confront Evil, you will have to confront it on
its own terms, not in the form that suits your own mediocre concepts of a Last
Judgment. Stay here with me, lad. Evil is much more nasty than you
imagine.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Never,&quot; Chips said firmly.
&quot; 'Ours not to reason why, Ours but to do or die!' Any Englishman would
tell you the same.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No doubt,&quot; the old man
snickered. &quot;Your countrymen are as fat-headed as these Texans above us.
Glorifying that idiotic Light Brigade the way these bumpkins brag about their
defeat at the Alamo! As if stepping in front of a steamroller were the most
admirable thing a man could do with his time. Let me tell you a story,
son.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You may if you wish,&quot;
00005 said stiffly. &quot;But no cynical parable will change my sense of Right
and Duty.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Actually, you're glad of the
interlude; you're not all that eager to face the powers of Tsathoggua again. Let
that pass.&quot; The old man shifted to a more comfortable position and, still
oblivious of Chips' tired shifting from leg to leg, began:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">This is the story of Our Lady of
Discord, Eris, daughter of Chaos, mother of Fortuna. You have read some of it in
Bullfinch, no doubt, but his is the exoteric version. I am about to give you the
Inside Story.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Is the thought of a unicorn a real
thought? In a sense, that is the basic question of philosophy—</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
<i>thought you were going to tell me a story, not launch into some dreary German
metaphysics. 1 had enough of that at the University.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Quite so. The thought of a unicorn is
a real thought, then, to be brief. So is the thought of the Redeemer on the
Cross, the Cow who Jumped Over<b> </b>the Moon, the lost continent of Mu, the
Gross National Product, the Square Root of Minus One, and anything else capable
of mobilizing emotional energy. And so, in a sense, Eris and the other Olympians
were, and are, real. At the same time, in another sense, there is only one True
God and your redeemer in His only begotten son; and the lloigor, like
Tsathoggua, are real enough to reach out and draw you into their world, which is
on the other side of Nightmare. But I promised to keep the philosophy to a
minimum.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">You recall the story of the Golden
Apple, in the exoteric and expurgated version at least? The true version is the
same, up to a point. Zeus, a terrible old bore by the way, did throw a bash on
Olympus, and he did slight Our Lady by not inviting Her. She did make an apple,
but it was Acapulco Gold, not metallic gold. She wrote</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Korhhisti, on it, <i>to the
prettiest one, </i>and </span>rolled it into the banquet hall. Everybody—not
just the goddesses; that's a male chauvinist myth—started fighting over who
had the right to smoke it. Paris was never called in to pass judgment; that's
all some poet's fancy. The Trojan War was just another imperialistic rumble and
had no connection with these events at all.</p>
<p>What really happened was that everybody was squabbling over the apple and
working up a sweat and pushing one another around and pretty soon their
vibrations—Gods have very high vibration, exactly at the speed of light, in
fact—heated up the apple enough to unleash some heavy fumes. In a word, the
Olympians all got stoned.</p>
<p>And they saw a Vision, or a series of Visions.</p>
<p>In the first Vision, they saw Yahweh, a neighboring god with a world of his
own which overlapped theirs in some places. He was clearing the set to change
its valence and start a new show. His method struck them as rather barbarous. He
was, in fact, drowning everybody—except one family that he allowed to escape
in an Ark.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Chaos,&quot; said Hermes. &quot;That Yahweh is a <i>mean </i>mother',
even for a god.&quot;</p>
<p>And they looked at the Vision more closely, and because they could see into
the future and were all (like every intelligent entity) rabid Laurel and Hardy
fans and because they were zonked on the weed, they saw that Yahweh bore the
face of Oliver Hardy. All around him, below the mountain on which he lived (his
world was fiat), the waters rose and rose. They saw drowning men, drowning
women, innocent babes sinking beneath the waves. They were ready to vomit. And
then Another came and stood beside Yahweh, looking at the panorama of horrors
below, and he was Yahweh's Adversary, and, stoned as they were, he looked like
Stanley Laurel to them. And then Yahweh spoke, in the eternal words of Oliver
Hardy: &quot;Now look what <i>you </i>made me do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>And that was the first Vision.</p>
<p>They looked again, and they saw Lee Harvey Oswald perched in the window of
the Texas School Book Depository; and he, again, wore the face of Stanley
Laurel. And, because this world had been created by a great god named Earl
Warren, Oswald fired the only shots that day, and John Fitzgerald Kennedy was,
as the Salvation Army charmingly expresses it, &quot;promoted to glory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is Confusion,&quot; said Athena with her owl-eyes flashing, for
she was more familiar with the world created by the god Mark Lane.</p>
<p>Then they saw a hallway, and Oswald-Laurel was led out between two policemen.
Suddenly Jack Ruby, with the face of Oliver Hardy, stepped forward and fired a
pistol right into that frail little body. And then Ruby spoke the eternal words,
to the corpse at his feet: &quot;Now look what <i>you </i>made me do,&quot; he
said.</p>
<p>And that was the second Vision.</p>
<p>Next, they saw a city of 550,000 men, women and children, and in an instant
the city vanished; shadows remained where the men were gone, a firestorm raged,
burning pimps and infants and an old statue of a happy Buddha and mice and dogs
and old men and lovers; and a mushroom cloud arose above it all. This was in a
world created by the crudest of all gods, <i>Realpolitik.</i></p>
<p>&quot;This is Discord,&quot; said Apollo, disturbed, laying down his lute.</p>
<p>Harry Truman, a servant of Realpolitik, wearing the face of Oliver Hardy,
looked upon his work and saw that it was good. But beside him, Albert Einstein,
a servant of that most elusive and gnomic of gods, Truth, burst into tears, the
familiar tears of Stanley Laurel facing the consequences of his own karma. For a
brief instant, Truman was troubled, but then he remembered the eternal words:
&quot;Now look what <i>you </i>made me do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>And that was the third Vision.</p>
<p>Now they saw trains, many trains, all of them running on time, and the trains
criss-crossed Europe and ran 24 hours a day, and they all came to a few destina-</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">tions that were alike. There, the
human cargo was stamped, catalogued, processed, executed with gas, tabulated,
recorded, stamped again, cremated and disposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;This is Bureaucracy,&quot; said
Dionysus, and he smashed his wine jug in anger; beside him, his lynx glared
balefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And then they saw the man who had
ordered this, Adolf Hitler, wearing still the mask of Oliver Hardy, and he
turned to a certain rich man, Baron Rothschild, wearing the mask of Stanley
Laurel, and they knew this was the world created by the god Hegel and the angel
Thesis was meeting the demon Antithesis. Then Hitler spoke the eternal words:
&quot;Now look what <i>you </i>made me do,&quot; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And that was the fourth Vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">They did then look further and, lo,
high as they were they saw the founding of a great republic and proclamations
hailing new gods named Due Process and Equal Rights for All. And they saw many
in high places in the republic form a separate cult and worship Mammon and
Power. And the Republic became an Empire, and soon Due Process and Equal Rights
for All were not worshipped, and even Mammon and Power were given only
lip-service, for the true god of all was now the impotent</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">

They Get Us.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;This is Aftermath,&quot; said
Hera, and her bosom shook with tears for the fate of the children of that
nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And they saw many bombings, many
riots, many rooftop snipers, many Molotov cocktails. And they saw the capital
city in ruins, and the leader, wearing the face of Stanley Laurel, taken
prisoner amid the rubble of his palace. And they saw the chief of the
revolutionaries look about at the rubble and the streets full of corpses, and
they heard him sigh, and then he addressed the leader, and he spoke the eternal
words: &quot;Now look what <i>you </i>made me do,&quot; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And that was the fifth Vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And now the Olympians were coming
down and they looked at each other in uncertainty and dismay. Zeus himself spoke
first.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Man,&quot; he said, &quot;that
was Heavy Grass.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Far </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">fuckin
out,&quot; Hermes agreed solemnly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Tree fuckin mendous,&quot;
added Dionysus, petting his lynx.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;We were really fuckin <i>into </i>it,&quot;
Hera summed up, for all.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And they turned their eyes again on
the Golden Apple and read the word Our Lady Eris had written upon it, that most
multiordinal of all words, Korhhisti. And they knew that each god and goddess,
and each man and woman, was in the privacy of the heart, the prettiest one, the
fairest; the most innocent, the Best. And they repented themselves of not having
invited Our Lady Eris to their party, and they summoned her forth and asked her,
&quot;Why did you never tell us before that all categories are false and all
Good and Evil a delusion of limited perspective?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And Eris said, &quot;As men and women
are actors on a stage of our devising, so are we actors on the stage devised by
the Five Fates. You had to believe in Good and Evil and pass judgments on your
creatures, the men and women below. It was a curse the Fates put upon you! But
now you have come to the Great Doubt and you are free.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The Olympians thereupon lost interest
in the god-game and soon were forgotten by humanity. For She had shown them a
great Light, and a great Light destroys shadows; and we are all, gods and
mortals, nothing else but gliding shadows. Do you believe that?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No,&quot; said Fission Chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Very well,&quot; the Dealy Lama
said somberly. &quot;Begone, back to the world of maya!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And Fission Chips whirled head over
heels into a vortex of bleatings and squealings, as tune and space were given
another sharp tug and, nearly a month later, head <i>over heels, the Midget is
up and tottering across Route 91 as the rented Ford Brontosaurus shrieks to a
stop and Saul and Barney are out the doors (every cop instinct telling them that
a man who runs from an accident is hiding something) but John </i>Dillinger,
driving toward Vegas from the north, continues to hum &quot;Good-bye forever,
old sweethearts and gals, God . . . bless . . . <i>you . . &quot; and the same
tug in space-time grips Adam Weishaupt two centuries earlier, causing him to
abandon his planned soft sell and blurt out to an astonished Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe, &quot;Spielen Sie Strip Schnipp-Schnapp?&quot; and Chips, </i>hearing
Weishaupt's words, is back in the graveyard at Ingolstadt as four dark figures
move away in dusk.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Strip Schnipp-Schnapp?&quot;
</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Goethe asks, putting hand on
chin in a pose that was later to become famous, <i>&quot;Das ist dein hoch

says nervously, <i>&quot;Der Zweck heiligte die Mittel.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Ingolstadt always reminds me of the
set of a bleeding Frankenstein movie, and, after Saint Toad and that shoggoth
chap and the old Lama with his wog metaphysics, it was no help at all to have an
invisible voice ask me to join him in a bawdy card game. I've faced some weird
scenes in H.M. Service but this Fernando Poo caper was turning out to be
outright unwholesome, in fact <i>unheimlich </i>as these krauts would say. And,
hi the distance, I began to hear wog music, but with a Yank beat to it, and
suddenly I knew the worst: that blasted Lama or Saint Toad or somebody, had
lifted nearly a month out of my life. I had walked into Saint Toad's after
midnight on March 31 (call it April 1, then) and this would be April 30 or May
1. <i>Walpur-gisnacht. </i>When all the kraut ghosts are out. And I was probably
considered dead back in London. And if I called in and tried to explain what had
happened, old W. would be downright <i>psychiatric </i>about the matter, oh,
he'd be sure I was well around the bend. It was a rum go either way.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Then I remembered that the old Lama
in Dallas had </span>said he was sending me to the final battle between Good and
Evil. This was probably it, right here, right now, this night in Ingolstadt. A
bit breathtaking to think of that. I wondered when the Angels of the Lord would
appear: bloody soon, I hoped. It would be nice to have them around when Old Nick
unleashed the shoggoth and Saint Toad and that lot.</p>
<p>So I toddled out into the streets of Ingolstadt and started sniffing around
for the old sulphur and brimstone.</p>
<p>And half a mile below and twelve hours earlier, George Dorn and Stella Maris
were smoking some Alamout Black hash with Harry Coin.</p>
<p>&quot;You haven't got a bad punch for an intellectual,&quot; Coin said with
warm regard.</p>
<p>&quot;You're pretty good at rape yourself,&quot; George replied, &quot;for
the world's most incompetent assassin.&quot;</p>
<p>Coin started to draw back his lips in an angry snarl, but the hash was too
strong. &quot;Hagbard told you, Ace?&quot; he asked bashfully.</p>
<p>&quot;He told me most of it,&quot; George said. &quot;I know that everybody
on this ship once worked for the Illuminati directly or for one of their
governments. I know that Hagbard has been an outlaw for more than two
decades—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty-three years exactly,&quot; Stella said archly.</p>
<p>&quot;That figures,&quot; George nodded. &quot;Twenty-three years, then, and
never killed anybody until that incident with the spider ships four days
ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he <i>killed </i>us,&quot; Harry said dreamily, drawing on the
pipe. &quot;What he does is worse than capital punishment, while it's going on.
I can't say I'm the same man I was before. But it's pretty bad until you come
through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; George grinned. &quot;I've had a few samples
myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard's system,&quot; Stella said, &quot;is very simple. He just
gives you a good look at your own face in a mirror. He lets you see the puppet
strings. It's still up to you to break them. He's never forced anyone to do <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">anything
that goes against their heart. Of course,&quot; she frowned in concentration,
&quot;he does sort of maneuver you into places where you have to find out in a
hurry just what your heart <i>is </i>saying to you. Did he ever tell you about
the Indians?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Shoshone?&quot; George
asked. &quot;The cesspool gag?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Let's play a game,&quot; Com
interrupted, sinking lower in his chair as the hash hit him harder. &quot;One of
us in this room is a Martian, and we've got to guess from the conversation which
one it is.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Okay,&quot; Stella said easily.
&quot;Not the Shoshone,&quot; she told George, &quot;the Mohawk.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You're not the Martian,&quot;
Coin giggled. &quot;You stick to the subject, and that's a human trait.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George, trying to decide if the
octopus on the wall was somehow connected with the Martian riddle, said, &quot;I
want to hear about Hagbard and the Mohawk. Maybe that</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">will help us identify the
Martian. You think up good games,&quot; he added kindly, &quot;for a guy who was
sent on seven assassination missions and fucked up every one of them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm dumb but I'm lucky,&quot;
Coin said. &quot;There was always somebody else there blasting away at the same
time. Politicians are <i>awfully </i>unpopular these days, Ace.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">This was a myth, Hagbard had confided
to George. Until Harry Coin had completed his course in the Celine System, it
was better if he believed himself the world's most unsuccessful assassin rather
than face the truth: that he had goofed only on his first job (Dallas, November
22, 1963) and really had killed five men since then. Of course, even if Hagbard
wasn't a holy man any longer, he was still tricky: maybe Harry had, indeed,
missed every time. Perhaps Hagbard was keeping the image of Harry as mass
murderer in George's mind to see if George could relate to the man's present
instead of being hung up on his &quot;past.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">At least I've learned this much,
George thought. The word &quot;past&quot; is always in quotes for me, now.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Mohawk,&quot; Stella said,
leaning back lazily (George's male organ or penis or dick or whatever the hell
is the natural word, if there is a natural word, well, my cock, then, my
delicious ever-hungry cock rose a centimeter as her blouse tightened on her
breasts, Lord God, we'd been humping like wart hogs in rutting season for hours
and hours and hours and I was still horny and still in love with her and I
probably always would be, but then again maybe I'm the Martian). Well, in fact,
the old pussy hunter didn't rise more than a millimeter, not a centimeter, and
he was as slow, as an old man getting out of bed in January. I had just about
fucked until my brains came out my ears, even before Harry brought in the hash
and wanted to talk. Looking for the Martian. Looking for the governor of Dorn.
Looking for the Illuminati. Krishna chasing his tail around the curved space of
the Einsteinian universe until he disappears up his own ass, leaving behind a
behind: the back of the void: the Dorn theory of circutheosodomognosis.
&quot;Owned some land,&quot; she continued. That beautiful black face, like ebon
melody: yes, no painter could show but Bach could hint the delight of those
purple-tinted lips in that black face, saying, &quot;And the government wanted
to steal the land. To build a dam.&quot; The inside of her cunt had that purple
hue to it, also, and there was a tawny beige in her palm, like a Caucasian's
skin, there were so many delights in her body, and in mine, too, treasures that
couldn't be spent in a million years of the most tender and violent fucking.
&quot;Hagbard was the engineer hired to build the dam, but when he found out
that the Indians would be dispossessed and relocated on less fertile ground, he
refused the job.&quot; Eris, Eros spelled sideways. &quot;He broke his contract,
so the government sued him,&quot; she said. &quot;That's how he got to be a
close friend with the Mohawk.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Which was all pure crapperoo.
Obviously, Hagbard had gone to court as a lawyer for the Indians, but that one
touch of shame in him had kept him from admitting to Stella that he had once
been a lawyer, so he made up that bit about being the engineer on the dam to
explain how he got involved in the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;He helped them move when they
were dispossessed.&quot; I could see bronze men and women moving in twilight, a
hill in the background. &quot;This was a long time ago, back in the '50s, I
think. (Hagbard was a hell of a lot older than he looked.) One Indian was
carrying a raccoon he said was his grandfather. He was a very old man himself.
He said Grandfather could remember General Washington and how he changed after
he became President. (He would be there tonight, that being who had once been</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George Washington and Adam
Weishaupt: he of whom Hitler had said, &quot;He is already among us. He is
intrepid and terrible. I am afraid of him.&quot;) Hagbard says he kept thinking
of Patrick Henry, the one man who saw what had happened at the Constitutional
Convention. It was Henry who had looked at the Constitution and said right away,
'I smell a rat. It squints toward monarchy.' The Old Indian, whose name was
Uncle John Feather, said that Grandfather, when he was a man, could speak to all
animals. He said the Mohawk Nation was more than the living, it was the soul and
the soil joined together. When the land was taken, some of the soul died. He
said that was why he couldn't speak to all animals but only to those who had
once been part of his family.&quot; The soul is in the blood, moving the blood.
It is in the night especially. Nutley is a typical Catholic-dominated New Jersey
town, and the Dorns are Baptists, so I was hemmed in two ways, but even as a boy
I used to walk along the Passaic looking for Indian arrowheads, and the soul
would move when I found one. Who was the anthropologist who thought the Ojibway
believed all rocks were alive? A chief had straightened him out: &quot;Open your
eyes,&quot; he said, &quot;and you'll see <i>which </i>rocks are alive.&quot; We
haven't had our Frobenius yet, American anthropology is like virgins writing
about sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;<i>I</i> know <i>who </i>the <i>Martian
</i>is,&quot; Coin crooned in a singsong. &quot;But I'm not telling. Not
yet.&quot; That man who was either the most successful or the most unsuccessful</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">assassin of the 20th century and who
had raped me (which was supposed to destroy my manhood forever according to some
idiots) was smashed out of his skull and he looked so happy that I was happy <i>for
</i>him.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hagbard,&quot; Stella went on,
&quot;stood there like a tree. He was paralyzed. Finally, old Uncle John Feather
asked what was the matter.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Stella leaned forward, her face more
richly black against the golden octopus on the wall. &quot;Hagbard had foreseen
the ecological catastrophe. He had seen the rise of the Welfare State, Warrior
Liberalism (as he calls it) and the spread of Marxism out of Russia across the
world. He saw why it all had to happen, with or without the Illuminati helping
it along. He understood the Snafu Principle.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He had worked all that night, after
explaining to Uncle John Feather that he was troubled in his heart at the
tragedy of the Mohawk (not mentioning the more enormous tragedy coming at the
planet, the tragedy which the old man understood already in his own terms); hard
work, carrying pitiful cheap furniture from cabins onto trucks, tying whole
households' possessions with tough ropes; he was sweating and winded when they
finished shortly before dawn. The next day, he had burned his naturalization
papers and put the ashes in an envelope addressed to the President of the United
States, with a brief note: &quot;Everything relevant is ruled irrelevant.
Everything material is ruled immaterial. An ex-citizen.&quot; The ashes of his
Army Reserve discharge went to the Secretary of Defense with a briefer note: <i>&quot;Non
serviam. </i>An ex-slave.&quot; That year's income tax form went to the
Secretary of the Treasury, after he wiped his ass on it; the note said:
&quot;Try robbing a poor box. <i>Der Einziege.&quot; </i>His fury still
mounting, he grabbed his copy of <i>Das Kapital </i>off the bookshelf, smiling
bitterly at the memory of his sarcastic marginal notes, scrawled &quot;Without
private property there is no private life&quot; on the flyleaf, and mailed it to
Josef Stalin in the Kremlin. Then he buzzed his secretary, gave her three months
pay in lieu of notice of dismissal and walked out of his law office forever. He
had declared war on all governments of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">His afternoon was spent giving away
his savings, which at that time amounted to seventy thousand dollars. Some he
gave to drunks on the street, some to little boys or little girls in parks; when
the Stock Exchange closed, he was on Wall Street, handing out fat bundles of
bills to the wealthiest-looking men he could spot, telling them, &quot;Enjoy it.
Before you die, it won't be worth shit.&quot; That night he slept on a bench hi
Grand Central Terminal; in the morning, flat broke, he signed on as A.B.S.
aboard a merchant ship to Norway.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That summer he tramped across Europe
working as tourist guide, cook, tutor, any odd job that fell his way, but mostly
talking and listening. About politics. He heard that the Marshall Plan was a
sneaky way of robbing Europe under the pretense of helping it; that Stalin would
have more trouble with Tito than he had had with Trotsky; that the Viet Minh
would surrender soon and the French would retake Indo-China; that nobody in
Germany was a Nazi anymore; that everybody in Germany was still a Nazi; that
Dewey would unseat Truman easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">During his last walking tour of
Europe, in the 1930s, he had heard that Hitler only wanted Czechoslovakia and
would do anything to avoid war with England; that Stalin's troubles with Trotsky
would never end; that all Europe would go socialist after the next war; that
America would certainly enter the war when it came; that America would certainly
stay out of the war when it came.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">One idea had remained fairly
constant, however, and he heard it everywhere. That idea was that more
government, tougher government, more honest govern-ment was the answer to all
human problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard began making notes for the
treatise that! later became <i>Never Whistle While You're Pissing. </i>He| began
with a section that he later moved to the middle of the book:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It is now theoretically possible to
link the human nervous system into a radio network so that, micro-miniaturized
receivers being implanted in people's brains, the messages coming out of these
radios would be indistinguishable to the subjects from the voice of their own
thoughts. One central transmitter, located in the nation's capital, could
broadcast all day long what the authorities wanted the people to believe. The
average man on the receiving end of these broadcasts would not even know he was
a robot; he would think it was his own voice he was listening to. The average
woman could be treated similarly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It is ironic that people will find
such a concept both shocking and frightening. Like Orwell's <i>1984, </i>this is
not a fantasy of the future but a parable of the present. Every citizen in every
authoritarian society already has such a &quot;radio&quot; built into his or her
brain. This radio is the little voice that asks, each time a desire is formed,
&quot;Is it safe? Will my wife (my husband/my boss/my church/my community)
approve? Will people ridicule and mock me? Will the police come and arrest
me?&quot; This little voice the Freudians call &quot;The Superego,&quot; with
Freud himself vividly characterized as &quot;the ego's harsh master.&quot; With
a more functional approach, Peris, Hefferline and Goodman, in <i>Gestalt
Therapy, </i>describe this process as &quot;a set of conditioned verbal
habits.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">This set, which is fairly uniform
throughout any authoritarian society, determines the actions which will, and
will not, occur there. Let us consider humanity a biogram {the basic DNA
blueprint of the human organism and its potentials) united with a logogram (this
set of &quot;conditioned verbal habits&quot;). The biogram has not changed in
several hundred thousand years; the logogram is different in each society. When
the logogram reinforces the biogram, we have a libertarian society, such as
still can be found among some American</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Indian tribes. Like Confucianism
before it became authoritarian and rigidified, American Indian ethics is based
on speaking from the heart and acting from the heart—'that is, from the
biogram.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">No authoritarian society can tolerate
this. All authority is based on conditioning men and women to act from the
logogram, since the logogram is a set created by those in authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Every authoritarian logogram divides
society, as it divides the individual, into alienated halves. Those at the
bottom suffer what I shall call the <i>burden of nescience. </i>The natural
sensory activity of the biogram—what the person sees, hears, smells, tastes,
feels, and, above all, what the organism as a whole, or as a potential whole, <i>wants
—is </i>always <i>irrelevant and immaterial. </i>The authoritarian logogram,
not the field of sensed experience, determines what is relevant and material.
This is as true of a highly paid advertising copywriter as it is of an engine
lathe operator. The person acts, not on personal experience and the evaluations
of the nervous system, but on the orders from above. Thus, personal experience
and personal judgment being nonoperational, these functions become also less
&quot;real.&quot; They exist, if at all, only in that fantasy land which Freud
called the Unconscious. Since nobody has found a way to prove that the Freudian
Unconscious really exists, it can be doubted that personal experience and
personal judgment exist; it is an act of faith to assume they do. The organism
has become, as Marx said, &quot;a tool, a machine, a robot.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Those at the top of the authoritarian
pyramid, however, suffer an equal and opposite <i>burden of omniscience. </i>All
that is forbidden to the servile class—the web of perception, evaluation and
participation in the sensed universe—is demanded of the members of the master
class. They must attempt to do the seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling
and decision-making for the whole society.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But a man with a gun is told only
that which people assume will not provoke him to pull the trigger. Since all
authority and government are based on force, the master class, with its burden
of omniscience, faces the servile class, with its burden of nescience, precisely
as a highwayman faces his victim. <i>Communication is possible only between
equals. </i>The master class never abstracts enough information from the servile
class to know what is actually going on in the world where the actual
productivity of society occurs. Furthermore, the logogram of any authoritarian
society remains fairly inflexible as time passes, but everything else in the
universe constantly changes. The result can only be progressive disorientation
among the rulers. The end is debacle.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The schizophrenia of authoritarianism
exists both in the individual and in the whole society.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I call this the Snafu Principle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That autumn, Hagbard settled in Rome.
He worked as a tourist guide, amusing himself by combining authentic Roman
history with Cecil B. DeMille (none of the tourists ever caught him out); he
also spent long hours scrutinizing the published reports of Interpol. His <i>Wanderjahr
</i>was ending; he was preparing for action. Never subject to guilt or
masochism, he had one reason only for his dispersal of his savings: to prove to
himself that what he intended could be done starting from zero. When</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">winter arrived, his studies were
complete: Interpol's crime statistics had very kindly provided him with a list
of those commodities which, either because of tariffs intended to stifle
competition or because of &quot;morals&quot; laws, could become the foundation
of a successful career in smuggling.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">One year later, in the Hotel Claridge
on Forty-fourth Street in New York, Hagbard was placed under arrest by two U.S.
narcotics agents named Galley and Eichmann. &quot;Don't take it too hard,&quot;
Galley said. &quot;We're only following orders.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It's okay,&quot; Hagbard said,
&quot;don't feel guilty. But what are you going to do with my cats?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Galley knelt on the floor and
examined the kittens thoughtfully, scratching one under the chin, rubbing the
ear of the other. &quot;What's their names?&quot; he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The male is called
Vagina,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;The female I call Penis.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The male is called <i>what?&quot;
</i>Eichmann asked, blinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The male is Vagina, and the
female is Penis,&quot; Hagbard said innocently, &quot;but there's a metaphysic
behind it. First, you have to ask yourself, which appeared earlier on this
planet, life or death? Have you ever thought about that?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">'This guy is nuts,&quot; Galley told
Eichmann.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You've got to realize,&quot;
Hagbard went on, &quot;that life is a coming apart and death is a coming
together. Does that help?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(&quot;I never know whether Hagbard
is talking profundity or asininity,&quot; George said dreamily, toking away.)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Reincarnation works <i>backward
in time,&quot; </i>Hagbard went on, as the narcs opened drawers and peered under
chairs. &quot;You always get reborn into an earlier historical period. Mussolini
is a witch in the 14th century now, and catching hell from the Inquisitors for
his bum karma in this age. People who 'remember' the past are all deluded. The
only ones who really remember past incarnations remember the <i>future, </i>and
they become science-fiction writers.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(A little old lady from Chicago
walked into George's room with a collection can marked Mothers March Against
Phimosis. He gave her a dime and she thanked him and left. After the door
closed, George wondered if she had been a hallucination or just a woman who had
fallen through a space-time warp and landed on the <i>Leif Erikson.)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What the hell are these?&quot;
Eichmann asked. He had been searching Hagbard's closet and found some red, white
and blue bumper stickers. The top half of each letter was blue with white stars,
and the bottom half was red-and-white stripes; they looked patriotic as all
get-out. The slogan formed this way was</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">LEGALIZE ABORTION PREGNANCY IS A JEWISH
PLOT!</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard had been circulating these in
neighborhoods like the Yorkville section of Manhattan, the western suburbs of
Chicago, and other places where old-fashioned Father Coughlin-Joe McCarthy style
Irish Catholic fascism was still strong. This was a trial run on the
logogram-biogram double-bind tactic out of which the Dealy Lama later developed
Operation Mindfuck.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Patriotic stickers,&quot;
Hagbard explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Well, they <i>look </i>patriotic
. . .&quot; Eichmann conceded dubiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(&quot;Did a little woman from
Chicago just walk through this room?&quot; George asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No,&quot; Harry Coin said,
toking again. &quot;I didn't see any woman from Chicago. But <i>I</i> know <i>who
</i>the Martian <i>is.&quot;)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What the hell are these?&quot;
Galley asked. He had found some business-size cards saying RED in green letters
and GREEN in red letters.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(&quot;When you're out of it all the
way, on the mountain,&quot; George asked, &quot;that's neither the biogram nor
the logogram, right? What the hell is it, then?&quot;)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;An antigram,&quot; Hagbard
explained, still helpful.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The cards are an
antigram?&quot; Eichmann repeated, bewildered.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I may have to place you under
arrest and take you downtown,&quot; Hagbard warned. &quot;You've both been very
naughty boys. Breaking and entering. Pointing a gun at me—that's technically
assault with a deadly weapon. Seizing my narcotics—that's theft. All sorts of
invasion of privacy. Very, very naughty.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">can't
arrest <i>us,&quot; </i>Eichmann whined. <i>&quot;We're </i>supposed to arrest <i>you.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Which is red and which is
green?&quot; Hagbard asked.</span></p>
<p>&quot;Look again,&quot; They looked and RED was now really red and GREEN was
really green. (Actually, the tints changed according to the angle at which
Hagbard held the card, but he wasn't giving away his secrets to them.) &quot;I
can also change up and down,&quot; he added. &quot;Worse yet, I clog zippers.
Neither one of you can open your fly right now, for instance. My real gimmick,
though, is reversing revolvers. Try to shoot me and the bullets will come out
the back and you'll never use your good right hand again. Try it and see if I'm
bluffing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't you go a little easy on us, officer?&quot; Eichmann took out his
wallet. &quot;A cop's salary ain't the greatest in the world, eh?&quot; He
nudged Hagbard insinuatingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you trying to bribe me?&quot; Hagbard asked sternly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; Harry Coin whined. &quot;You got nothing to gain by
killing me. Take the money and put me off the sub at the first island you
pass.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Hagbard said thoughtfully, counting the money.</p>
<p>&quot;I can get more,&quot; Harry added. &quot;I can send it to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure.&quot; Hagbard put the money in his clam-shell ashtray and
struck a match. There was a brief, merry blaze, and Hagbard asked calmly,
&quot;Do you have any other inducements to offer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll tell you anything you want to know about the Illuminati!&quot;
Harry shrieked, really frightened now, realizing that he was in the hands of a
madman to whom money meant nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;I know more about the Illuminati than you do,&quot; Hagbard replied,
looking bored. &quot;Give me a philosophic reason, Harry. Is there any purpose
in allowing a specimen like you to go on preying on the weak and innocent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Honest, I'll go straight. I'll join your side. I'll work for you, kill
anybody you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's a possibility,&quot; Hagbard conceded. &quot;It's a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">slim
one, though. The world is full of killers and potential killers. Thanks to the
Illuminati and their governments, there's hardly an adult male alive who hasn't
had some military training. What makes you think I couldn't go out on the
streets of any large city and find ten better-qualified killers than you inside
an afternoon?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Harry said,
breathing hard. &quot;I don't have no college education, but I'm not a fool
either. Your men dragged me from Mad Dog Jail to this submarine. You want <i>something,
</i>Ace. Otherwise, I'd be dead already.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes, I want something.&quot;
Hagbard leaned back in his chair. &quot;Now you're getting warm, Harry. I want
something but I won't tell you what it is. You've got to produce it and show it
to me without any clues or hints. And if you can't do that, I really will have
you killed. I shit you not, fellow. This is my version of a trial for your past
crimes. I'm the judge and the jury and you've got to win an acquittal without
knowing the rules. How do you like that game?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It ain't fair.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It's more of a chance than you
gave any of the men you shot, isn't it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Harry Coin licked his lips. &quot;I
think you're bluffing,&quot; he ventured finally. &quot;You're some chicken-shit
liberal who doesn't believe in capital punishment. You're looking for an excuse
to <i>not </i>kill me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Look into my eyes, Harry. Do
you see any mercy in them?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Coin began to perspire and finally
looked down into his lap. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said hollowly. &quot;How much
tune do I have?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard opened his drawer and took
out his revolver. He cracked it open, showing the bullets, and quickly snapped
it closed again. He slipped the safety catch—a procedure he later found
unnecessary with George Dorn, who knew nothing about guns— and aimed at
Harry's belly. &quot;Three days and three minutes are both too long,&quot; he
said casually. &quot;If you're</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">ever
going to get it, you're going to get it now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Mama,&quot; Coin heard himself
exclaim.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You're going to shit your pants
in a moment,&quot; Hagbard said coldly. &quot;Better not. I find bad smells
offensive, and I might shoot you just for that. And mama isn't here, so don't
call her again.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Coin saw himself lunging across the
room, the gun roaring in mid-leap, but at least trying to get his hands on this
bastard's throat before dying.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Pointless,&quot; Hagbard
grinned icily. &quot;You'd never get out of the chair.&quot; His finger
tightened slightly, and Coin's gut churned; he knew enough about guns to know
how easy it was to have an accident, and he thought of the gun going off even
before the bastard Celine intended it to, maybe even as he was on the edge of
guessing the goddam riddle, the pointlessness of it was the final horror, and he
looked again into those eyes without guilt or pity or any weakness he could
exploit; then, for the first time in his life, Harry Coin knew peace, as he
relaxed into death.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Good enough,&quot; Hagbard said
from far away, snapping the safety back in place. &quot;You've got more on the
ball than either of us realized.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Harry slowly came back and looked at
that face and those eyes. &quot;God,&quot; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm going to give you the gun
in a minute,&quot; Hagbard went on. &quot;Then it's <i>my </i>turn to sweat. Of
course, if you kill me you'll never get off this sub alive, but maybe you'll
think that's worthwhile, just for revenge. On the other hand, maybe you'll be
curious about that instant of peace—and you'll wonder if there's an easier way
to get back there and if I can teach it to you. Maybe. One more thing, before I
toss you the gun. Everybody who joins me does it by free choice. When you said
you'd come over to my side just because you were afraid of dying, you had no
value to me at all. Here's the gun, Harry. Now, I want you to check it. There
are no gimmicks, no missing firing pin or anything like that. No other tricks,
either—nobody watching you through a peephole and ready to gun you</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">down the minute you aim at me, or
anything like that. I'm totally at your mercy. What are you going to do?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Harry examined the gun carefully, and
looked back at Hagbard. He had never studied kinesics and orgonomy as Hagbard
had, but he could read enough of the human face and body to know what was going
on in the other man. Hagbard had that same peace he himself had experienced for
a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You win, you bastard,&quot;
Harry said, tossing the gun back. &quot;I want to know how you do it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Part of you already
knows,&quot; Hagbard smiled gently, putting the gun back in the drawer.
&quot;You just did it, didn't you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What would he have done if I
did block?&quot; Harry asked Stella in present time.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Something. I don't know. A
sudden act of some sort that scared you more than the gun. He plays it by ear.
The Celine System is never twice the same.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Then I was right, he <i>wouldn't
</i>have killed me. It was all bluff.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes and no.&quot; Stella looked
past Harry and George, into the distance. &quot;He wasn't acting with you, he
was manifesting. The mercilessness was quite real. There was no sentimentality
involved in saving you. He did it because it's part of his Demonstration.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;His Demonstration?&quot; George
asked, thinking of geometry problems and the neat Q.E.D. at the bottom, back in
Nutley years and years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I've known Hagbard longer than
she has,&quot; Eich-mann said. &quot;In fact, Galley and I were among the first
people he enlisted. I've watched him over the years, and I still don't
understand him. But I understand the Demonstration.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You know,&quot; George said
absently, &quot;when you two first came in, I thought you were a
hallucination.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You never saw us at dinner,
because we work in the kitchen,&quot; Galley explained. &quot;We eat after
everybody else.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Only a small part of the crew
are former crim</span>inals,&quot; Stella told George, who was looking confused.
&quot;Rehabilitating a Harry Coin—pardon me, Harry— doesn't really excite
Hagbard much. Rehabilitating policemen and politicians, and teaching them useful
trades, is work that really turns Hagbard on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But not for sentimental reasons,&quot; Eichmann emphasized. &quot;It's
part of his Demonstration.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's his Memorial to the Mohawk Nation, too,&quot; Stella said.
&quot;That trial set him off. He tried a direct frontal assault that time,
attempting to cut through the logogram with a scalpel. It didn't work, of
course; it never does. Then he decided: 'Very well, I'll put them where words
can't help, and see what they do then.' That's his Demonstration.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard, actually—well, not <i>actually; </i>this is just what he told
me—had started with two handicaps, intending to prove that they weren't
handicaps. The first was that he would have a bank balance of exactly $00.00 at
the beginning, and the second was that he would never kill another human being
throughout the Demonstration. That which was to be proved (namely, that
government is a hallucination, or a self-fulfilling prophecy) could be shown
only if all his equipment, including money and people, came to him through
honest trade or voluntary association. Under these rules, he could not shoot
even in self-defense, for the biogram of government servants was to be
preserved, and only their logograms could be disconnected, deactivated and
defused. The Celine System was a consistent, although flexible, assault on the
specific conditioned reflex—that which compelled people to look outside
themselves, to a god or a government, for direction or strength. The servants of
government all carried weapons; Hagbard's insane scheme depended on rendering
the weapons harmless. He called this the Tar-Baby Principle (&quot;You Are
Attached To What You Attack&quot;).</p>
<p>Being a man of certain morbid self-insight, he realized that he himself
exemplified the Tar-Baby Principle and that his attacks on government kept him
perpetually attached to it. It was his malign and insidious notion that
government was even more attached to <i>him; </i>that his existence <i>qua </i>anarchist
<i>qua </i>smuggler <i>qua </i>outlaw aroused greater energetic streaming in
government people than their existence aroused in him: that, in short, he was
the Tar Baby on which they could not resist hurling themselves in anger and
fear: an electrochemical reaction in which he could bond them to himself just as
the Tar Baby captured anyone who swung a fist at it.</p>
<p>More (there was always more, with Hagbard), he had been impressed, on reading
Weishaupt's <i>Uber Strip Schnipp-Schnapp, Weltspielen and Funfwissenschaft, </i>by
the passage on the Order of Assassins, which read:</p>
<p>Surrounded by Moslem maniacs on one side and Christian maniacs on the other,
the wise Lord Hassan preserved his people and his cult by bringing the art of
assassination to esthetic perfection. With just a few daggers strategically
placed in exactly the right throats, he found Wisdom's alternative to war, and
preserved the peoples by killing their leaders. Truly, his was a most exemplary
life of grandmotherly kindness.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Grossmutterlich Gefalligkeit,&quot; </i>muttered Hagbard, who had
been reading this in the original German, &quot;now where have I heard that
before?&quot;</p>
<p>In a second, he remembered: the <i>Mu-Mon-Kan </i>or &quot;Gateless
Gate&quot; of Rinzai Zen contained a story about a monk who kept asking a Zen
Master, &quot;What is the Buddha?&quot; Each time he asked, he got hit upside
the head with the Master's staff. Finally discouraged, he left and sought
enlightenment with another Master, who asked him why he had left the previous
teacher. When the poor gawk explained, the second Master gave him the
ontological hotfoot: &quot;Go back to your previous Master at once,&quot; he
cried, &quot;and apologize for not showing enough appreciation of his
grandmotherly kindness!&quot;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard was not surprised that
Weishaupt evidently knew, in 1776 when <i>Uber Strip Schnipp-Schnapp </i>was
written, about a book which hadn't yet been translated into any European tongue;
he was astonished, however, that even the evil Ingolstadt <i>Zauberer </i>had
understood the rudiments of the Tar-Baby Principle. It never pays to
underestimate the Illuminati, he thought then —for the first time. He was to
think it many times in the next two and a half decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">On April 24, when he told Stella to
deliver some Kallisti Gold to George's stateroom, Hagbard had already asked
FUCKUP the odds that Illuminati ships would arrive in Peos within the time he
intended to be there. The answer was better than 100-to-l. He thought about what
that meant, then buzzed to have Harry Coin sent in.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Harry swaggered to a chair, trying to
look insolent, and said, &quot;So you're the leader of the Discordians,
eh?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes,&quot; Hagbard said evenly,
&quot;and on this ship, my word is law. <i>Wipe that silly grin off your face
and sit up straight.&quot; </i>He observed the involuntary stiffening of Harry's
body before the man caught himself and remembered to maintain his slouch.
Typical: Coin could resist the key conditioning phrases, but only with effort.
&quot;Listen,&quot; he said softly &quot;/ <i>will tell you only one more
time&quot;—</i>another Bavarian Fire Drill, that—&quot;This is my ship. You
will address me as Captain Celine. You will <i>come to attention </i>when I talk
to you. Otherwise . . .&quot; he let the phrase trail off.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Slowly, Coin shifted to a more
respectful kinesic posture—immediately modifying it by grinning more
insolently. Well, that was good; the streak of rebellion ran deep. The breathing
was not bad for a professional criminal: the only block seemed to be at the
bottom of the exhalation. The grin was a defense against tears, of course, as
with most chronic American smilers. Hagbard attempted a probe: Harry's father
was the kind who pretended to consider the case and to toy with forgiveness
before he would administer the thrashing.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Is that better?&quot; Harry
asked, accentuating his respectful posture and grinning more sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;A little,&quot; Hagbard said,
sounding mollified. &quot;But I don't know what I'm going to do with you, Harry.
That's a bad bunch you've been mixed up with, very <i>un-American.&quot; </i>He
paused to get a reaction to the word; it came at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Their money is as good as
anyone's,&quot; Harry said defiantly. His shoes crept backwards, as he spoke,
and his neck decreased an inch—the turtle reflex, Hagbard called it; and it
was a sure sign of the repressed guilt denied by the man's voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You were born pretty poor,
weren't you?&quot; Hagbard asked, in a neutral tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Poor? We was white
niggers.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Well, I guess there's some
excuse for you . . .&quot; Hagbard watched: the grin grew wider, the body
imperceptibly moved back toward slouching. &quot;But, to turn on <i>your own
country, </i>Harry. That's bad. That's the lowest thing a human being can do.
It's like turning against <i>your own mother.&quot; </i>The toes curled inward
again, tentatively. What did Harry's father say before wielding the belt?
Hagbard caught it: &quot;Harry,&quot; he repeated it gravely, &quot;you haven't
been acting like a <i>proper white man. </i>You've been acting like you got <i>nigger
blood.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The grin stretched to the breaking
point and became a grimace, the body stiffened to the most respectful possible
posture. &quot;Now, look here, sir,&quot; Harry began, &quot;you got no call to
talk to me that way—&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And you're not even <i>ashamed,&quot;
</i>Hagbard ran over him. &quot;You don't show any <i>remorse.&quot; </i>He
shook his head with profound discouragement. &quot;I can't let you wander around
loose, committing more crimes and treasons. I'm going to have to feed you to the
sharks.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Listen, Captain Celine, sir,
I've got a money belt under this shirt and it's full of more hundred-dollar
bills than you ever saw at one time . . .&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Are you trying to bribe
me?&quot; Hagbard asked sternly; the rest of the scene would be easy, he
reflected. Part of his mind drifted to the Illuminati ships he would meet at
Peos. There was no way to use the Celine System without communicating, and he
knew the crew would be &quot;protected&quot; against him by some Illuminati
variation on the ear wax of Ulysses' men passing the Sirens. The money would go
in the giant clam-shell ashtray, a real shocker for a man like Coin, but what
would he do about the Illuminati ships?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">When the time came to produce the
gun, he slipped the safety off viciously. If I'm going to join the ancient
brotherhood of killers, he thought morosely, maybe I should have the stomach to
start with a visible target. &quot;Three days and three minutes are both too
long,&quot; he said, trying to sound casual, &quot;if you're ever going to get
it, you're going to get it now.&quot; They would be at Peos in less than an
hour, he thought, as Coin involuntarily cried &quot;Mama.&quot; Like Dutch
Schultz, Hagbard reflected; like how many others? It would be interesting to
interview doctors and nurses and find out how many people passed out with that
primordial cry for the All-Protector on their lips . . . but Harry finally
surrendered, abdicated, left the robot running itself according to the biogram.
He was no longer sitting in an insolent slouch, a respectful attention, a guilty
cramp ... He was simply sitting. He was ready for death.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Good enough,&quot; Hagbard
said. &quot;You've got more on the ball than either of us realized.&quot; The
man would now transfer his submissive reflexes to Hagbard; and the next stage
would be longer and harder, before he learned to stop playing roles entirely and
just manifest as he had in the face of extinction.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The gun gambit was variation #2 of
the third basic tactic in the Celine System; it had five usual sequels. Hagbard
picked the most dangerous one—he usually did, since he didn't much like the
gun gambit at all, and could only stomach it if he gave most of the subjects a
chance at the other role. This time, however, he knew he had another motive:
somewhere, deep inside, a coward in him hoped Harry Coin was crazier than he had
estimated and would, in fact, shoot; that way</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard could avoid the decision
awaiting him in Peos.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You win, you bastard,&quot;
Coin's voice said; Hagbard came back and quickly rushed through a small verbal
game involving Hell images picked up from Harry's childhood. When he had Coin
sent back to his room, under light security, he slouched in his chair and rubbed
his eyes tiredly. He probed for Dorn and found the Dealy Lama was on that
channel, broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">—Leave the kid alone, he beamed.
It's my turn now. Go contemplate your navel, you old fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A shower of rose petals was the
nonverbal answer. The Lama faded out. George went on rapping to himself on the
themes planted by the ELF leader: Odd, the big red one. Eye think it was his I.
The eye of Apollo. His luminous I.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">—Aye, trust me not, Hagbard beamed.
Trust not a man who's rich in flax—his morals may be sadly lax. (Some of my
own doubts getting in here, he thought.) Her name is Stella Maris. Black star of
the seas. (I won't tell him who she and Mavis really are.) George, I want you in
the captain's control room.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George should start with variation <i>#1,
</i>the <i>Liebestod </i>or orgasm-death trip, Hagbard decided. Make him aware
of the extent to which he treats women as objects—and, of course, give him
some mystical hogwash later to gloss it over temporarily, so the doubt will be
pushed into the unconscious for a while. Yes: George was already on a
pornography trip, very similar to Atlanta Hope and Smiling Jim Treponema, except
that in his case it was egodystonic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That was a
good trick,&quot; George said a few moment's later in the captain's control
room, &quot;how you got me up on the bridge with that telepathy thing.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard, still
thinking about the decision in Peos, tried to look innocent when he replied,
&quot;I called you on the intercom.&quot; He realized that he was whistling and
pissing at once, worrying about Peos as well as about George, and brought
himself back sharply. &quot;Absurd&quot; was the word in George's mind—absurd
innocence. Well, Hagbard thought, I fucked that one up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You think I
can't tell a voice in my head from a voice in my ears?&quot; George demanded.
Hagbard roared with laughter, totally in the present again; but after George had
been sent to the chapel for his initiation, the problem returned. Either the
Demonstration failed, or the Demonstration failed. Double bind. Damned both
ways. It was infuriating, but all the books had warned him long ago: &quot;As ye
give, so shall ye get.&quot; He had used the Celine System on quite a few people
over nearly three decades, and now he was in the middle of a classic Celine Trap
himself. There was no correct answer, except to give up trying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">When the moment
came, though, he found that part of him had not given up trying. &quot;Ready for
destruction of enemy ships,&quot; said Howard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard shook his
head. George was remembering some crazy incident in which he had tried to commit
suicide while standing by the Passaic River, and Hagbard kept picking up parts
of that bum trip while trying to clear his own head. &quot;I wish we could
communicate with them,&quot; he said aloud, realizing that he was possibly
blowing the guru game by revealing his inner doubts to George. &quot;I wish I
could give them a chance to surrender ...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You don't want
them too close when they go,&quot; said Howard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Are your
people out of the way?&quot; Hagbard asked in agony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Of
course,&quot; the dolphin replied irritably. &quot;Quit this hesitating. This is
no time to be a humanitarian.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The sea is
crueler than the land,&quot; Hagbard protested, but then he added
&quot;sometimes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The sea is cleaner than the
land,&quot; Howard replied. Hagbard tried to focus—the dolphin was obviously
aware of his distress, and soon George would be (no: a quick probe showed George
had retreated from the scene into the past and was shouting, &quot;You silly
sons of bitches,&quot; at somebody named Carlo). &quot;These people have been
your enemies for thirty thousand years.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm not that old,&quot; Hagbard
said wearily. The Demonstration had failed. He was committed, and others with
him were now committed. Hagbard reached out a brown finger, let it rest on a
white button on the railing in front of him, then pressed it decisively.
&quot;That's all there is to it,&quot; he said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(&quot;Be a wise-ass then! When you
start flunking half your subjects,-perhaps you'll come back to reality.&quot; A
voice long, long ago ... at Harvard . . . And once, in the South, he had been
moved by a very simple, a ridiculously simple, Fundamentalist hymn:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Jesus walked this lonesome valley He
had to walk it all alone Nobody else could walk there for Him He had to walk it
by Himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I will walk this lonesome valley,
Hagbard thought bitterly, all by myself, all the way to Ingolstadt and the final
confrontation. But it's meaningless now, the Demonstration has failed; all I can
do is pick up the pieces and salvage what I can. Starting with Dorn right here
and right now.)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hate, like molten lead, drips from
the wounded sky . . . they call it air pollution . . . August Personage dials
slowly, with the cunt-starved eyes of a medieval saint. . . &quot;God
lies!&quot; Weishaupt cried in the middle of his first trip, &quot;God is
Hate!&quot; . . . Harry Coin is crumpled in his chair . . . George's head hangs
at an angle, like a doll with a broken spring . . . Stella doesn't move. . .
They are not dead but stoned . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Abe Reles blew the whistle on the
entire Murder Inc. organization in 1940 . . . He named Charley Workman as the
chief gun in the Dutch Schultz massacre ... He gave the details proving the
roles of Lepke (who was executed) and Luciano (who was imprisoned and, later,
exiled) ... He kept his mouth shut about certain other things, however . . . But
Drake was worried. He gave orders to Maldonado, who conveyed them to a capo, who
passed them on to some soldiers . . . Reles was guarded by five policemen but
nonetheless he went out his hotel window and spread like jam on the ground below
. . . There were mutterings in the press . . . The coroner's jury couldn't
believe that five cops were on the take from the Syndicate . . . Reles's. death
was declared to be suicide . . . But in 1943, as the Final Solution moved into
high gear, Lepke announced he wanted to talk before his execution . . . Tom
Dewey, alive by grace of the Dutchman's death, was governor, and he granted a
stay of execution . . . Lepke spent twenty-four hours with Justice Department
officials and it was announced later that he refused to reveal anything of
significance . . . One of the officials had been brought back from State to work
with Justice because of his background on Schultz and the Big Six Syndicate ...
He said little, but Lepke read a lot in his eyes . . . His name, of course, was
Winifred . . . Lepke understood: as Bela Lugosi once said, there are worse
things than dying . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In 1932 the infant son of aviator
Charles Lindbergh Jr. was kidnapped . . . Already at that time, a heist of that
dimension could not be permitted in the Northeast without the consent of a
full-fledged don of the Mafia . . . Even a capo could not authorize it alone . .
. The aviator's father, Congressman Charles Lindbergh Sr., had been an outspoken
critic of the Federal Reserve monopoly . . . Among other things, he had charged
on the floor of Congress, &quot;Under the Federal Reserve Act panics are
scientifically created; the present one is the first scientifically created one
worked out as we figure a mathematical problem ...&quot; The go-between in
delivering the ransom money was Jafsie Condon, Dutch Schultz's old high school
principal . . . &quot;It's got to be one of them coincidences,&quot; as Marty
Krompier said later....</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">John Dillinger arrived in Dallas on
the morning of November 22, 1963, and rented an Avis at the airport. He drove
out to Dealy Plaza and scouted the terrain. The Triple Underpass where Harry
Coin was supposed to stand when doing the job was under observation from a
railroadman's shack, he noted; it occurred to him that the man in that shack
would not have a long life expectancy. There would be a lot of other
eyewitnesses, he realized, and the JAMs couldn't protect them all, not even with
the help of the LDD. It was going to be bad all around ... In fact, the man in
the railroad shack, S. M. Holland, told a story that didn't jibe with the Earl
Warren version, and later died when his car went off the road under
circumstances that aroused speculation among those given to speculating; the
coroner's jury called it an accident. . . Dil-linger found his spot in the
thickly wooded part of the Grassy Knoll and waited until Harry Coin appeared on
the Underpass. He made himself relax and looked around to be sure that he was
invisible from everywhere but a helicopter (there were no helicopters: the
Illuminati's top double agent within the Secret Service had seen to that). A
movement in the School Book Depository caught Ms eye. Something not kosher up
there. He swung his binoculars . . . and caught another head, ducking</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
quickly, atop the Dal-</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Tex
building. An Italian, very young . . . That was bad. If one of Maldonado's
soldiers was here, either the Illuminati were aware they had a double agent in
their midst and had hired two assassins, or else the Syndicate was acting on its
own. John panned back to the School Book Depository: whoever that clown was, he
had a rifle, too, and he was being cagey: definitely not Secret Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">This was a piss-cutter.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">John's original plan was to plug
Harry Com before Coin could get a bead on the young Hegelian from Boston. Now,
he had three men to knock out at once. It couldn't be done. There was no human
way of hitting more than two of those targets—all three of them in different
areas and at different elevations—before the fuzz were swarming all over him.
The third would have time to do the job while that was happening. It was what
Hagbard called an existential <i>koan.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Shit, piss and industrial
waste,&quot; John muttered, quoting another Celinism.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Well, save what you can, as Harry
Pierpont always said when a bank job went sour in the middle. Save what you can
and haul ass out of that place.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">If Kennedy had to die, and obviously
it was in the cards or in the <i>I Ching </i>at least (which probably explained
why Hagbard, after consulting that computer of his, refused to get involved in
this caper), then &quot;save what you can&quot; could only be applied, in this
case, to mean: screw the Illuminati. He would give them a mystery they would
never solve.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The motorcade was already in front of
the School Book Depository, and the gazebo up there might start blasting at any
minute, if Harry Coin or the Mafiosos weren't quicker. Dillinger hoisted his
rifle, quickly sighted on John F. Kennedy's skull, and thought briefly, <i>Even
if it falls through and doesn't remain an enigma to bug the Illuminati, think of
those wild headlines when I'm caught: PRESIDENT SHOT BY JOHN DILLINGER, people
will think Orson Welles is publishing the papers now, </i>and then he tightened
his finger.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(&quot;Murder?&quot; George asked.
&quot;It's hard not to think of Good and Evil when a man's games get that
hairy.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;During the Kali Yuga,&quot;
Stella replied, &quot;almost all our games are played with live ammunition.
Haven't you noticed?&quot;)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The three shots blew brains into
Jackie Kennedy's lap and Dillinger, whirling in amazement, saw the man start to
run out of the Grassy Knoll down into the street. John set off in pursuit and
caught a glimpse of the face as the killer mingled in the crowd below.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Christ!&quot; John said. <i>&quot;Him?&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Stella toked again—she never seemed
to think she I was sufficiently stoned. &quot;Wait,&quot; she said.
&quot;There's a I passage in <i>Never Whistle While You're Pissing </i>that goes
into this a bit.&quot; She got up, walking quite slowly like all potheads, and
rummaged among the books on the wall shelf. &quot;You know the old saying,
'different strokes for different folks'?&quot; she asked over her shoulder.
&quot;Hagbard and FUCKUP have classified sixty-four thousand personality types,
depending on which strokes, or gambits, they use most often in relating to
others.&quot; She found the book and carefully walked back to her chair.
&quot;For instance,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Right now, you can intersect my
life line in a number of ways, from kissing my hand to slitting my throat.
Between those extremes, you can, let's say, carry on an intellectual
conversation with sexual flirtation underneath it, or an intellectual
conversation with sexual flirtation and also with kinesic signals indicating
that the flirtation is only a game and you don't really want me to respond, and
on an even deeper level you can be sending other signals indicating that
actually you do want me to respond after all but you're not ready to admit that
to yourself. In authoritarian society, as we know it, people are usually sending
either very simple dominance signals—'I'm going to master you, and you better
accept it before I get really nasty'—or submissive signals—'You're going to
master me, and I'm reconciled to it.'&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Lord in Heaven,&quot; Harry
Coin said softly. &quot;That was what my first session with him was all about. I
tried dominance signals to bluff him, and it didn't work. So I tried submissive
signals, which is the only other gimmick I ever knew, and that didn't work
either. So I just gave up.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Your brain gave up,&quot;
Stella corrected. &quot;The strategy center, for dealing with human relations in
authoritarian society, was exhausted. It had nothing left to try. Then the Robot
took over. The biogram. You acted from the heart.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;But what has redundance got to
do with this?&quot; George asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Here's the passage,&quot;
Stella said. She began to read aloud:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">People exist on a spectrum from the
most re</span>dundant to the most flexible. The latter, unless they are
thoroughly trained in psychodynamics, are always at a disadvantage to the former
in social interactions. The redundant do not change their script; the flexible
continually keep changing, trying to find a way of relating constructively.
Eventually, the flexible ones find the &quot;proper&quot; gambit, and
communication, of a sort, is possible. They are now on the set created by the
redundant person, and they act out his or her script.</p>
<p>The steady exponential growth of bureaucracy is not due to Parkinson's Law
alone. The State, by making itself ever more redundant, incorporates more people
into its set and forces them to follow its script.</p>
<p>&quot;That's heavy,&quot; George said, &quot;but I'll be damned if I can see
how it applies to Jesus <i>or </i>Emperor Norton.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly!&quot; Harry Coin chortled. &quot;And that ends the game.
You've just proven what I suspected all along. <i>You're </i>the Martian!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't raise your voices,&quot; Galley said drowsily from the floor.
&quot;I can see hundreds of blissful Buddhas floating through the air ...&quot;</p>
<p>A single blissful Buddha, meanwhile—together with an inverted Satanic
cross, a peace symbol, a pentagon and the Eye in the Triangle—were taking up
Danny Pricefixer's attention, back in New York. He had finally decided to play
his hunch about the <i>Confrontation </i>bombing and the five associated
disappearances. The decision came after he and the acting head of Homicide
received a thorough ass-chewing from the Police Commissioner himself.
&quot;Malik is gone. The Walsh woman is gone. This Dora kid was taken right out
of a jail in Texas. Two of my best men, Goodman and Mul-doon, are gone. The Feds
are nasty and I can tell they know something that makes this case even more
important than five possible murders alone would account for. I want you to
report some kind of progress before <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">the
day is over, or I'll replace you with Post-Toasties Junior G-Men.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">When they escaped into the hall,
Pricefixer asked the man from Homicide, Van Meter, &quot;What are you going to
do?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Go back and give my men the
same ass-chewing. They'll produce.&quot; Van Meter didn't really sound
convinced. &quot;What are <i>you </i>going to do?&quot; he added lamely.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm going to play a
hunch,&quot; Danny said, and he walked down to Bunco-Fraud, where he exchanged
some words with a detective named Sergeant Joe Friday who always insisted on
trying to act like his namesake in the famous television series.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I want a mystic,&quot; Danny
said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Palmist, crystal-gazer, witch,
astrologer . . . any preference?&quot; Friday asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The technique doesn't matter. I
want one you've never been able to pin anything on. One you investigated and
found a little scary ... as if she or he really did have something on the
ball.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I know the one you want,&quot;
Friday said emphatically, hitting the intercom button on his phone. &quot;R
&amp; I,&quot; he said and waited. &quot;Carella? Send up the package on Mama
Sutra.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The package, when it shot out of the
interoffice tube, proved to be all that Danny had hoped for. Mama Sutra had no
arrests. She had been investigated several times—usually at the demand of rich
husbands who thought she had too much influence over their wives, and once at
the demand of the board of directors of a public utility who thought the
president of the firm consulted too often with her—but none of her activities
involved any claims that could be construed to be in violation of the fraud
laws. Furthermore, she had dealt with the extremely wealthy for many years and
had never played any games remotely like an <i>okanna borra </i>or Gypsy Switch
on any of them. Her business card, included in the package, modestly offered
only &quot;spiritual insight,&quot; but she evidently delivered it in horse
doctor's</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt"> </span>doses: one detective,
after interviewing her, quit the force and entered a Trappist monastery in
Kentucky, a second became questionable and finally useless in the eyes of his
superiors because of an incessant series of memos he wrote urging that New York
be the first American city to experiment with the English system of unarmed
policemen, and a third announced that he had been a closet queen for two decades
and began sporting a Gay Liberation button, necessitating his immediate transfer
to the Vice Squad.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my woman,&quot; Pricefixer said; and an hour later, he sat in
her waiting room studying the blissful Buddha and other occult accessories,
feeling like a horse's ass. This was really going way out on a limb, he knew,
and his only excuse was that Saul Goodman frequently cracked hopeless cases by
making equally bizarre jumps. Danny was ready to jump: the disappearance of
Professor Marsh, in Arkham, was connected with the <i>Confrontation </i>mystery,
and both were connected with Fernando Poo and the gods of Atlantis.</p>
<p>The receptionist, an attractive young Chinese woman named Mao
something-or-other, put down her phone and said, &quot;You can go right
in.&quot;</p>
<p>Danny opened the door and walked into a completely austere room, white as the
North Pole. The white walls had no paintings, the white rug was solid white
without any design in it, and Mama Sutra's desk and the Danish chair facing it
were also white. He realized that the total lack of occult paraphernalia,
together with the lack of color, was certainly more impressive than heavy
curtains, shadows, smoldering candles and a crystal ball.</p>
<p>Mama Sutra looked like Maria Ouspenskaya, the old actress who was always
popping up on the late late show to tell Lon Chaney Jr. that he would always
walk the &quot;thorny path&quot; of lycanthropy until &quot;all tears empty into
the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; she asked in a brisk, businesslike manner.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a detective on the New York Police,&quot; Danny <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">said,
showing her his badge. &quot;I'm not here to hassle you or give you any trouble.
I need knowledge and advice, and I'll pay for it out of my own pocket.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">She smiled gently. &quot;The other
officers, who investigated me for fraud in the past, must have created quite a
legend at police headquarters. I promise no miracles, and my knowledge is
limited. Perhaps I can help you; perhaps not There will be no fee, in either
case. Being in a sensitive profession, I would like to keep on friendly terms
with the police.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Danny nodded. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he
said. &quot;Here's the story . . .&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Wait.&quot; Mama Sutra frowned.
&quot;I think I am picking up something already. Yes. <i>District Attorney Wade.
Clark. The ship is sinking. 2422. If I can't live as please, let me die when I
choose. </i>Does any of that mean anything to you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Only the first part,&quot;
Danny said, perplexed. &quot;I suspect that the matter I'm investigating goes
back at least as far as the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The man who
handled the original investigation of that killing, in Dallas, was District
Attorney Henry Wade. The rest of it doesn't help at all, though. Where did you
get it from?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;There are ... vibrations . . .
and I register them.&quot; Mama Sutra smiled again. &quot;That's the best
explanation I can offer. It just happens, and I've learned how to use it.
Somewhat. I hope someday before I die a psychologist will go far enough out in
his investigations to find something that will explain to <i>me </i>what I do.
The sinking ship is meaningless? How about the date, <i>June 15, 1904? </i>That
seems to be on the same wave.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Pricefixer shook his head. &quot;No
help, as they say in poker.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Wait,&quot; Mama Sutra said.
&quot;It means something to me. There was an Irish writer, James Joyce, who
studied the theosophy of Blavatski and the mysticism of the Golden Dawn Society.
He wrote a novel in which all the action takes place on June 16, 1904. The</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt">
</span>novel is called <i>Ulysses, </i>and is impregnated on every page with
coded mystical revelations. And, yes, now I remember, there is a shipwreck
mentioned in it. Joyce made all the background details historically accurate, so
he included what was actually in the Dublin papers that day—the book takes
place in Dublin, you see— and one of the stories concerned the sinking of the
ship, <i>General Slocum, </i>in New York Harbor the day before, June 15.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you say Golden Dawn?&quot; Pricefixer demanded excitedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Does that help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It just adds to the confusion, but at least it shows you're on the
right track. The case I'm working on seems to be connected with the
disappearance of a professor from a university in Massachusetts several years
ago, and he left behind some notes that mentioned the Golden Dawn Society and .
. . let's see ... some of its members. Aleister Crowley is one name I
remember.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;To Mega Theiron,&quot; </i>Mama Sutra said slowly, beginning to pale
slightly. &quot;Young man, what you are involved in is very serious. Much more
than an ordinary police officer could understand. But you are not an ordinary
police officer or you wouldn't have come to me in the first place. Let me tell
you flatly, then, that what you have stumbled upon is something that could very
easily involve both James Joyce's mysticism and the assassination of President
John Kennedy. But to understand it you will have to stretch your mind to the
breaking point. Let me suggest that you wait while I have my receptionist make
you a rather stiff drink.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't drink on duty, ma'am,&quot; Danny said sadly. Mama Sutra took a
deep breath. &quot;Very well. You'll have to take it cold and struggle with it
as best you can.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does it involve the lloigor?&quot; Danny asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. You already have a large part of the puzzle if you know that
much.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Ma'am,&quot; Danny said,
&quot;I think I'll have that drink. Bourbon, if you have it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">2422, he thought while Mama Sutra
spoke to the receptionist, that's even crazier than the rest of this. 2 plus 4
plus 2 plus 2. Adds up to 10. The base of the decimal system. What the hell does
that mean? Or 24 plus 22 adds up to 46. That's two times 23, the number missing
in between 24 and 22. Another enigma. And 2 times 4 times 2 times 2 is, let's
see, 32. Law of falling bodies. High school physics class. 32 feet per second
per second. And 32 is 23 backwards. Nuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Miss Mao entered with a tray.
&quot;Your drink, sir,&quot; she said softly. Danny took the glass and watched
her gracefully walk back toward the door. <i>Mao </i>is Chinese for cat, he
remembered from his years in Army Intelligence, and she certainly moved like a
cat. <i>Mao: </i>onomatopoeia they call that. Like kids calling a dog
&quot;woof-woof.&quot; Come to think of it, that's how we got the word
&quot;wolf.&quot; Funny, I never thought of that before. Oh, the pentagram
outside, and the pentagram in those old Lon Chaney Wolf Man movies. Malik's</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">mystery mutts. Enough of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He took a stiff wallop of the bourbon
and said, &quot;Go ahead. Start. I'll take some more of the medicine when my
mind starts crumbling.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'll give it to you raw,&quot;
Mama Sutra said quietly. &quot;The earth has already been invaded from outer
space. It is not some threat in the future, for writers to play with. It
happened, a long time ago. Fifty million years ago, to be exact.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Danny took another belt of his drink.
&quot;The lloigor,&quot; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That was their generic name for
themselves. There were several races of them. Shoggoths and Tcho-Tchos and
Dholes and Tikis and Wendigos, for instance. They were not entirely composed of
matter as we understand it, and they do not occupy space and time in the
concrete way that furniture does. They are not sound waves or radio waves or
anything like that either, but think of them that way for a while. It's better
than not having any mental picture of them at all. Did you take any physics in
high school?&quot; <i>',</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Nothing like relativity,&quot;
Danny said, realizing that he was believing all this.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sound and light?&quot; she
asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;A little.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Then you probably know two
elementary experiments. Project a white light through a prism and a spectrum
appears on the screen behind the prism. You've seen that?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And the experiment with a glass
tube that has a thin layer of colored powder on the bottom, when you send a
sound wave through it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yeah. And the wave leaves
little marks at each of its valleys and you can see them in the powder.&quot;
The track of the invisible wave in a visible medium.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Very well. Now you can picture,
perhaps, how the lloigor, although not made of matter as we understand it, can
manifest themselves in matter, leaving traces that show, let us say, a cross
section of what they really , are.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Danny nodded, totally absorbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;From our point of view,&quot;
Mama Sutra went on, &quot;they are intolerably hideous in these manifestations.
There is a reason for that. They were the source of the worst terrors
experienced by the first humans. Our DNA code still carries an aversion and
terror toward them, and this activates a part of our minds which the
psychologist Jung called the Collective Unconscious. That is where all myth and
art come from. Everything frightening, loathsome and terrible—in the folklore,
in the paintings and statues, in the legends and epics of every people on
earth—contains a partial image of a manifestation of the lloigor. 'As a
foulness shall ye know Them,' a great Arab poet wrote.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And they've been at war with us
through all history?&quot; Danny asked unhappily.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Not at all. Are the stockyards
at war with the cattle? It's nothing like war at all,&quot; Mama Sutra said sun-</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">ply. &quot;It's just that they <i>own
</i>us.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I see,&quot; Danny said.
&quot;Yes, of course. I see.&quot; He looked into his empty glass dismally.
&quot;Could I have another?&quot; he murmured.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">After Miss Mao had brought him
another bourbon, he took a huge swallow and slouched forward in his chair.
&quot;There's nothing we can do about it?&quot; he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;There is one group that has
been trying to liberate humanity,&quot; Mama Sutra said. &quot;But lloigor have
great powers to warp and distort minds. This group is the most maligned,
slandered and hated people on earth. All the evil they seek to prevent has been
attributed to them. They operate in secret because otherwise they would be
destroyed. Even now, the John Birch Society and various other
fanatics—including an evil genius named Hagbard Celine—struggle ceaselessly
to combat the group of whom I speak. They have many</span><span style="font-size:
13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">names, the Great White
Brotherhood, the Brethren of the Rosy Cross, the Golden Dawn . . . usually,
though they are known as the Illuminati.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes!&quot; Danny cried
excitedly. &quot;There was a whole bunch of memos about them at the scene of the
crime that started this case.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And the memos, I would wager,
portrayed them in an unfavorable light?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sure did,&quot; Danny agreed.
&quot;Made them seem the worst bastards in history. Pardon me, ma'am.&quot; I'm
getting drunk, he thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That is how they are usually
portrayed,&quot; Mama Sutra said sadly. &quot;Their enemies are many, and they
are few . . .&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Who are their enemies?&quot;
Danny leaned forward eagerly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Cult of the Yellow
Sign,&quot; Mama Sutra replied. &quot;This is a group serving one particular
lloigor called Hastur. They live in such terror of this being that they usually
call him He Who Is Not To Be Named. Hastur resides in a mysterious place called
Hali, which was formerly a lake but is now just desert. Hali was by a great city
in the lost civilization of Carcosa. You look as if those names mean something
to you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes. They were in the notes of
the professor who disappeared. The other case that I was convinced was connected
with this one.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;They have been
mentioned—unwisely, I think—by certain writers, such as Bierce and Chambers
and Lovecraft and Bloch and Derleth. Carcosa was located where the Gobi Desert
is at present. The major cities were Hali, Mnar and Sarnath. The Cult of the
Yellow Sign has managed to conceal all this rather thoroughly, although a few
archeologists have published some interesting speculations about the Gobi area.
Most of the evidence of a great civilization before Sumer and Egypt has been
either hidden or doctored so that it seems to point to Atlantis. Actually,
Atlantis never existed, but the Cult of the Yellow Sign carefully keeps the myth
alive so nobody will discover what went on, and still goes on, in the Gobian
wastelands. You see, the Cult of the Yellow Sign still goes there, on certain
occasions, to worship and make certain transactions with Hastur, and with Shub
Niggurath, a lloigor who is known in mystical literature as the Black Goat with
a Thousand Young, and with Nyarlathotep, who appears either as a solid black
man, not a Negro but black as an abyss, or else as a gigantic faceless flute
player. But I repeat: you cannot understand the lloigor by these manifestations
or cross sections into our space-time continuum. Do you believe in God?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes,&quot; Danny answered,
startled by the sudden personal question.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Take a little more of your
drink. I must tell you now that your God is another manifestation of some
lloigor. That is how religion began, and how the lloigor and their servants in
the Cult of the Yellow Sign continue it. Have you ever had what is called a
religious or mystical experience?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No,&quot; Danny said,
embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Good. Then your religion is
just a matter of believing what you have been told and not of a personal
emotional experience. All such experiences come from</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">the lloigor, to enslave us.
Revelations, visions, trances, miracles, all of it is a trap. Ordinary, normal
people instinctively avoid such aberrations. Unfortunately, due to their
gullibility and a concerted effort to brainwash them, they are willing to follow
the witches and wizards and shamans who traffic in these matters. You see, and I
urge you to take another drink right now, <i>every religious leader in human
history has been a member of the Cult of the Yellow Sign and all their efforts
are devoted to hoaxing, deluding and enslaving the rest of us.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Danny finished his glass and asked
meekly, &quot;May I have more?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mama Sutra buzzed for Miss Mao and
said, &quot;You're taking this part very well. People who <i>have </i>had
religious visions take it very poorly; they don't want to know what foul source
those experiences actually came from. The lloigor, of course, can be considered
gods— or demons—but it is more profitable, at this point in history, to just
consider them another life form cast up by the universe, unfortunately superior
to us and even more unfortunately inimical to us. You see, religion is always a
matter of sacrifice, and whenever there is a sacrifice there is a victim—and
also a person or entity profiting from the sacrifice. There is no religion in
the world—not one—that is not a front for the Cult of the Yellow Sign. The
Cult itself, like the lloigor, is of prehuman origin. It began among the snake
people of Valusia, the peninsula that is now Europe, and then spread eastward to
be adopted by the first humans in Carcosa. Always the purpose of the Cult has
been to serve the lloigor, at the expense of other human beings. Since the rise
of the Illuminati, the Cult has also</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">acted
to combat their work and discredit them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Danny was glad that Miss Mao arrived
then with his third stiff bourbon. &quot;And who are the Illuminati and what is
their goal?&quot; he asked, belting away a strong swallow.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Their founder,&quot; Mama Sutra
said, &quot;was the first man to think rationally about the lloigor. He realized</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">that they were not supernatural, but
just another aspect of nature; not all-powerful, but just more powerful than us;
and that when they came 'out of the heavens' they came from other worlds like
this one. His name has come down to us in certain secret teachings and
documents. It was Malik.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Jesus,&quot; Danny said,
&quot;that's the name of the guy whose disappearance started all this.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The name meant 'one who knows'
in the Carcosan tongue. Among the Persians and some Arabs today it still exists
but means 'one who leads.' His followers, the Illuminati, are those who have
seen the light of reason—which is quite distinct from the stupefying and
mind-destroying light in which the lloigor sometimes appear to overwhelm and
mystify their servants in the Cult of the Yellow Sign. What Ma-lik sought, what
the Illuminati still seek, is scientific knowledge that will surpass the powers
of the lloigor, end mankind's enslavement and allow us to become self-owners
instead of property.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;How large is the
Illuminati?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Very small. I don't know the
exact number.&quot; Mama Sutra sighed. &quot;I have never been accepted for
membership. Their standards are quite high. One must virtually be a walking
encyclopedia to qualify for an initial interview. You must remember that this is
the most dedicated, most persecuted, most secret group in the world. Everything
they do, if not wiped off the records by the Cult of the Yellow Sign, is always
misrepresented and pictured as malign, devious and totally evil. Indeed, any
effort to be rational, to think scientifically, to discover or publish a new
truth, even by those outside the Illuminati, is always pictured in those colors
by the Cult and all the religions which serve as its fronts. All churches,
Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Moslem, Hindu, Buddhist or whatever, have always
opposed and persecuted science. The Cult of the Yellow Sign even fills the mass
media with this propaganda. Their favorite stories are the one about the
scientist who isn't fully human until he has a religious insight and recognizes</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">'the higher powers'—the
lloigor, that is—and the other one about the scientist who seeks truth without
fear and causes a disaster. 'He meddled with things man should leave alone' is
always the punch line on that one. The same hatred of knowledge and
glorification of superstition and ignorance permeates all human societies. How
much more of this can you stand?&quot; Mama Sutra asked abruptly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I don't honestly know,&quot;
Danny said wearily. &quot;It seems if I do get to the bottom of this business,
it'll bring every power in this country down on my head. The least that'll
happen is that I'll get kicked out of my job. More likely, I'll disappear like
the man I'm looking for and the first two detectives on this case. But for my
own satisfaction, I'd like to know the rest of the truth, before I bid you good
day and look for a hole to hide in. You might also tell me how you can survive,
knowing as much as you do.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I have studied much. I have a
Shield. I cannot explain the Shield anymore than I can explain my ESP. I only
know that it works. As to answering your other questions, first tell me about
your investigation. Then I will be able to relate it to the Illuminati and the
Cult of the Yellow Sign.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Danny took another drink, closed his
eyes for a minute and launched into his story. He began with the Marsh
disappearance in Arkham four years earlier, his perusal of the missing
professor's notes, his reading in the books mentioned in those notes and his
conclusion that a drug cult was involved. Then he told of the <i>Confrontation </i>bombing,
his skimming of the Illuminati memos, the disappearance of Ma-lik, Miss Walsh,
Goodman and Muldoon, and the frantic curiosity of the FBI. &quot;That's
it,&quot; he concluded. &quot;That's about all I know.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mama Sutra nodded thoughtfully,
&quot;It is as I feared,&quot; she said finally. &quot;I think I can shed light
on the matter, but you will be well advised to leave the police force and seek
the protection of the Illuminati after you have heard. You are already, at this
very moment, in great peril.&quot; She lapsed into silence again, and then said,
&quot;You will not see the picture of what is happening now, until I give you
more of the background.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">For the next hour, Danny Pricefixer
sat transfixed as Mama Sutra told him of the longest war in history, the battle
for the freedom of the human mind waged by the Illuminati against the forces of
slavery, superstition and sorcery.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It began, she repeated, in ancient
Carcosa when the first humans were contacted by the serpent people of Valusia.
The latter brought with them certain fruits with strange powers. These fruits
would be called hallucinogens or psychedelics today, Mama Sutra said, but what
they did to the brain of the eater was not in any sense a hallucination. It
opened him to invasion by the lloigor. The chief fruit used</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">in these rites was a botanical
cousin of the modern apple, yellowish or golden in color, and the snake people
promised, &quot;Eat of this and you shall become all-powerful.&quot; In fact,
the eaters became enslaved by the lloigor, and especially by Hastur, who took up
residence in the Lake of Hali; distorted versions of what happened have come
down to us in various African legends about people who had commerce with snakes
and lost their souls, in the Homeric tale of the lotus eaters, in Genesis, and
in the Arabic lore utilized in the fiction of Robert W. Chambers, Ambrose Bierce
and others. Soon, the Cult of the Yellow Sign was formed among the eaters of the
golden apples, and its first high priest, Gruad, bargained with Hastur for
certain powers in return for .which the lloigor were fed on human sacrifices.
The people were told that the sacrifices were good for the crops—and this, in
fact, was partially true, for the lloigor ate only the energy of the victim, and
the body, buried in the fields, gave back its nitrogen to the soil. This was the
beginning of religion—and of government. Gruad controlled the Temple, and the
Temple soon controlled Hali, and, then, all of Carcosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">So things went for many thousands of
years, until the priests were rich, fat and decadent, while the citizens lived
in terror and slavery. The number of sacrifices increased ever, for Hastur grew
with each victim whose energy he absorbed and his appetite grew with him.
Finally, among the people, there arose one who had been refused admission to the
priesthood, Ma-lik, and he taught that humanity could become all-powerful, not
through eating the golden apples and sacrificing to the lloigor, but through a
process he called rational thought. He was, of course, fed to Hastur as soon as
the priests heard of this teaching, but he had followers, and they quickly
learned to keep their thoughts private and plan their activities in secret. This
was the age of midnight arrests, purge trials and accelerating sacrifices in
Carcosa, Mama Sutra said, and eventually the followers of Ma-lik—the few who
had escaped extermination—fled to the Thuranian subcontinent, which is now
Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There they met little people who had
come down from the north after the snake folk had exterminated each other in
some form of slow, insidious and stealthy civil war. (Apparently, the snakes
never met in a single battle during all this time: the poison in the wine cup,
the knife in the back and similar subtle activities had slowly escalated to the
deadly level of actual warfare. The serpent people had an aversion to <i>facing </i>an
enemy as they killed him.) The little people had had their own experiences with
the lloigor, long ago, but all they remembered were confused legends about Ores
(whom Mama Sutra identified with the Tcho-Tchos) and a great hero named Phroto
who battled a monster called Zaurn (evidently a shoggoth, Mama Sutra said.)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Many millenniums passed, and the
little people and the followers of Ma-lik intermarried, producing basically the
human race of today. A great law-giver named Kull tried to establish a rational
society on Ma-lik's principles, and fought a battle with some of the serpent
people who had surprisingly survived in hidden places; most of this got lost in
exaggeration and legend. After more thousands of years, a barbarian named Konan
or Conan arose, somehow, to the throne of </span>Aquilonia, mightiest kingdom on
the Thuranian subcontinent; Konan brooded much about the continuing horrors in
Carcosa, which he sensed as a threat to the rest of the world. Finally, he
disappeared, abdicating in favor of his son, Conn, and reputedly sailing <i>to
the west.</i></p>
<p>Konan, Mama Sutra said, was the same person who appeared in the Yucatan
peninsula at that time and became known as Kukulan. He was evidently seeking,
among the Mayan scientists, some knowledge or technology to use against the
lloigor. Whatever happened, he left them, and only the legend of Kukulan,
&quot;the feathered serpent,&quot; remained. When the Aztecs came down from the
north, Kukulan became Quetzalcoatl, and human sacrifice was instituted in his
name. The lloigor, in some fashion, had turned the work of Konan around and made
it serve their own ends.</p>
<p>Carcosa meanwhile perished. What happened is unknown, but some students of
ancient lore suspect that Konan actually circumnavigated the globe, collecting
knowledge as he went, and descended upon Carcosa with weapons that destroyed
both the Cult of the Yellow Sign and all traces of the civilization that served
it.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of history, Mama Sutra went on, the Cult of the Yellow
Sign never regained its former powers, but it has come very close in certain
times and certain places. The lloigor continued to exist, of course, but could
no longer manifest in our kind of space-time continuum unless the Cult performed
very complicated technical operations, which were sometimes disguised as
religious rituals and sometimes as wars, famines or other calamities.</p>
<p>Over the intervening ages, the Cult waged steady warfare against the one
power that threatened them: rationality. When they couldn't manifest a lloigor
to blast a mind, they learned to fake it; if real magic wasn't available, stage
magic served in its place. &quot;By 'real magic,' of course,&quot; Mama Sutra
explained, &quot;I mean the technology of the lloigor. As science-fiction writer
Arthur C. Clarke has commented, any sufficient<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">ly advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. The lloigor have
that kind of technology. That's how they got to earth from their star.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You mean their planet, don't
you?&quot; Danny asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No, they lived originally on a
star. I told you they were not made of matter as we understand it. Incidentally,
their origin on a star explains why the pentagram or star shape always attracts
their attention and is one of the best ways of summoning them. They invented
that design. A star doesn't look five-pointed to a human being, but that's what
it looks like to <i>them.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Finally, in the 18th century, the Age
of Reason appeared to be at hand. Tentatively, as an experiment, one branch of
the Illuminati surfaced in Bavaria. They were led by an ex-Jesuit named Adam
Weishaupt who had inside knowledge of how the Cult of the Yellow Sign operated
and performed its hoaxes and &quot;miracles.&quot; The real brain behind this
movement, however, was Weishaupt's wife, Eve; but they knew that, even in the
Age of Reason, humanity was not ready yet for a liberation movement led by a
woman, so Adam fronted for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The experiment was unsuccessful. The
Cult of the Yellow Sign planted fake documents in the home of an Illuminatus
named Zwack, whispered some hints to Bavarian government and then watched with
glee as the movement was disbanded and hounded out of Germany.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A simultaneous experiment began in
America, started by two Illuminati named Jefferson and Franklin. Both preached
reason, like Weishaupt, but carefully did not make his mistake of stating
explicitly how this contradicted religion and superstition. (This latter matter
they discussed only in their private letters.) Since Jefferson and Franklin were
national heroes, and since the rationalistic government they helped to create
seemed well established, the Cult of the Yellow Sign dared not denounce them
openly. One trial balloon was attempted: the Reverend Jebediah Morse, a high
Yellow Sign adept, openly accused Jefferson of being</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">an Illuminatus and charged him and
his party with most of the crimes that had discredited Weishaupt in Bavaria. The
American public was not deceived—but all subsequent Yellow Sign propaganda in
America has rested on the original anti-Illuminati claims of Reverend Morse.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Due to Jefferson, one Illuminati
symbol was adopted by the new government: the Eye on the Pyramid, representing
knowledge of geometry and, hence, of the order of nature. This was to be used in
later generations, if necessary, to indicate the truth about the founding of the
U.S. government, since it was well understood that the Cult of the Yellow Sign
would try to distort the facts as soon as possible. Another Illuminati work, of
more immediate importance, was the Bill of Rights (the part of the Constitution
still under most vigorous attack by the Yellow Sign fanatics) and certain key
expressions in early documents, such as the reference to &quot;Nature and
Nature's God&quot; in the Declaration of Independence—as far as Jefferson
dared to go in leavening traditional superstition with a natural-science
admixture. And, of course, the first half-dozen Presidents were all high-ranking
Masons and Rosicrucians who understood at least the fundamentals of Illuminati
philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mama Sutra sighed briefly, and went
on. All this, she said, is only the tip of the iceberg. Government actually
plays a minor role in controlling people; far more important are the words and
images that make up the semantic environment. The Cult of the Yellow Sign not
only suppresses words and images that threaten their power, but infiltrates
every branch of communications with their own ideology. Science and reason are
forever mocked or portrayed as menacing. Wishful thinking, fantasy, religion,
mysticism, occultism and magic are forever preached as the real solutions to all
problems. Best-selling books teach people to <i>pray, </i>not <i>-work, </i>for
success. Movies win awards by showing a child's ignorant faith justified over
the skepticism of adults. There is an astrology column in virtu-</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">ally every newspaper. More and more,
the ideology of the Cult of the Yellow Sign is set forth openly, as the ideas of
the Illuminati and the Founding Fathers are forgotten or distorted. One only has
to think of any antidemocratic, antirational or antihumane idea out of the Dark
Ages,' Mama Sutra said, and one can immediately think of some popular religious
columnist or some movie star who is blatantly expounding it and calling it
&quot;Americanism.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The Cult of the Yellow Sign, the old
woman continued, is determined to destroy the United States, because it came
closer than any other nation to the Illuminati ideals of free minds and free
people and because it still retains a few tattered relics of Illuminism in its
laws and customs.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">This is where Mr. Hagbard Celine
enters the picture, Mama Sutra said grimly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Celine, she went on, was a brilliant
but twisted personality, the son of an Italian pimp and a Norwegian prostitute.
Raised in the underworld, he early developed a contempt and hatred for ordinary,
decent society. The Mafia, recognizing his talents and predilections, took him
in and financed his way through Harvard Law School. After graduation, he became
an important mouthpiece for Syndicate hoodlums in trouble with the law. On the
side, however, he also took some cases for American Indians, since this was a
way of frustrating the government. In one particularly bitter battle, he
attempted to stop the construction of a much-needed dam in upstate New York; his
unbalanced behavior in the courtroom (which helped lose the case) indicated his
deep attraction for the occult, since he had obviously been taken in by the
superstitions of the Indians he served. Mafia dons conferred with leaders of the
Cult of the Yellow Sign, and soon, Hagbard, who had been wandering around Europe
aimlessly, was recruited to start a new front for the Cult, to fight the United
States both politically and religiously. This front, Mama Sutra said, was called
the Legion of Dynamic Discord, and, while it pretended to </span>be against all
governments, it was actually devoted only to harming the U.S. He was given a
submarine (which he later claimed to have designed himself) and became an
important cog in the Mafia heroin-smuggling business. More important, his
crew—renegades and misfits from all nations—were indoctrinated in a
deliberately nonsensical variety of mysticism.</p>
<p>An important center of Celine's heroin network, Mama Sutra added, was a fake
church in Santa Isobel on the island of Fernando Poo.</p>
<p>Obviously, Mama Sutra concluded, Joseph Malik, the editor of <i>Confrontation,
</i>was investigating the IIluminati, deceived by the lies spread against them
by Celine and the Yellow Sign adepts. As for Professor Marsh, his explorations
in Fernando Poo may have revealed something about Celine's heroin ring.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you think they're both dead,&quot; Danny said somberly. &quot;And,
probably, Goodman and Muldoon and Pat Walsh, the researcher, also.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not necessarily. Celine, as I have told you, is both brilliant and
quite insane. He has perfected his own form of brainwashing and it amuses him to
recruit rather than destroy any possible opponent. It is quite possible that all
of these people are working for him right now, against the Illuminati and the
United States, which they will believe to be the major enemies of
humanity.&quot; Mama Sutra paused thoughtfully. &quot;However, that is far from
sure. Events in the last few days have changed Celine for the worse. He is more
insane, and more dangerous, than ever. The assassinations of April 25 all across
the nation appear to be his work, engineered through the Mafia. He is striking
out blindly against anyone he imagines may be an Illuminatus. Needless to say,
most of the victims were not actually in the Illuminati, which is, as I have
mentioned, a very small organization. Since he is in this violent and paranoid
frame of mind, I fear for the lives of anyone associated with him.&quot;</p>
<p>Danny was slumped forward in his chair, drunk, dejected and depressed.
&quot;Now that I know,&quot; he asked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">rhetorically,
&quot;what can I do about it? My God, what can I do about it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I finally got around to reading <i>Telemachus
Sneezed </i>on the flight to Munich, a touch of appropriate syn-chronicity,
since Atlanta Hope (like the Illuminati's pet paperhanger) had an umbilical
connection backward toward Clark Kent's old enemy Lothar and his festive
burgher's unsure God. In fact, Atlanta wrote as if she had her own Diet of Worms
for breakfast every morning. What made it even more fan-fuckin'-tastic was that
she was on the same flight with me, sitting, in fact, a few seats ahead of me
and to port, or starboard, or whatever is the correct word for right when you're
in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mary Lou was with me; she was a hard
woman to get out of your system once you'd made it with her. John had advanced
me only enough money for my own passage, so I'd hustled some Alamout Black on
Wells Street to raise the extra fare for her, and then I had to explain that it
wasn't just a pleasure trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What's all the mystery?&quot;
she had asked, &quot;Are you CIA or a Commie or something for Christ's
sake?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;If I told you,&quot; I said,
&quot;you wouldn't believe it. Just enjoy the music and the acid and whatever
else is coming down, and when it happens you'll see it. You'd never believe it
before you see it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Simon Motherfucking Moon,&quot;
she told me gravely, &quot;after the yoga and sex you've taught me these last
three days, I'm ready to believe anything.&quot;</span></p>
<p>&quot;Ghosts? The <i>grand zombi?&quot;</i></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, there you go again, putting
me on,&quot; she protested.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;See?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">So it was more or less left at that
and we smoked two joints and hopped a cab out to O'Hare, passing all the signs
where they were tearing down lower-middle-class neighborhoods to turn them into
upper-middle-class high-rise neighborhoods and each sign said,</span></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">THIS </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">IS
ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT FOR CHICAGO—RICHARD J.</span></b></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">DALEY, MAYOR. Of course, in the
lower-class neighborhoods, they weren't tearing anything down, just waiting for
the people to go on another rampage and burn it down. The signs there were all
done with spray cans and had more variety: OFF THE PIG, BLACK p. STONE</span></p>
<p>RUNS IT, POWER TO THE PEOPLE, FRED LIVES, ALMIGHTY LATIN KINGS RUN IT, and
one that would have pleased Hagbard, OFF THE LANDLORDS. Then we got into the
traffic on the Eisenhower Expressway (Miss Doris Day standing before Ike's
picture in my old schoolroom flashed through memory like the ghost of an old
hard-on, the flesh of her mammary) and we put on our gas masks and sat while the
cab crawled along fast enough to possibly catch a senile snail with arthritis.</p>
<p>Mary Lou bought Edison Yerby's seventieth or eightieth novel in the airport,
which suited me fine since I like to read on airplanes myself. Looking around, I
spotted <i>Telemachus Sneezed </i>and decided, what the hell, let's see how the
other half thinks. So there we were at fifty thousand feet a few yards from the
author herself and I was plunged deeply into the <i>donner-und-blitzen </i>metaphysics
of God's Lightning. Unlike the lamentable Austrian monorchoid, Atlanta wrote
like she had balls, and she expressed her philosophy in a frame of fiction
rather than autobiography. Pretty soon, I was in her prose up to my ass and
sinking rapidly. Fiction always does that to me: I buy it completely and my
critical faculties come into action only after I'm finished.</p>
<p>Briefly, then, <i>Telemachus Sneezed </i>deals with a time in the near future
when we dirty, filthy, freaky, lazy, dope-smoking, frantic-fucking anarchists
have brought Law and Order to a nervous collapse in America'. The heroine, Taffy
Rhinestone, is, like Atlanta was once herself, a member of Women's Liberation
and a believer in socialism, anarchism, free abortions and the charisma of Che.
Then comes the rude awakening: food riots, industrial stagnation, a reign of
lawless looting and plunder, everything George Wallace ever <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">warned
us against—<i>but </i>the Supreme Court, who are all anarchists with names
ending in <i>-stein </i>or <i>-farb </i>or <i>-berger </i>(there is no <i>overt </i>anti-Semitism
in the book), keeps repealing laws and taking away the rights of policemen.
Finally, in the fifth chapter—the climax of Book One—the heroine, poor
toughy Taffy, gets raped <i>fifteen </i>times by an oversexed black brute right
out of <i>The Birth of a Nation, </i>while a group of cops stand by cursing,
wringing their hands and frothing at the mouth because the Supreme Court rulings
won't allow them to take any action.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In Book Two, which takes place a few
years later, things have degenerated even further and factory pollution has been
replaced by a thick layer of marijuana smoke hanging over the country. The
Supreme Court is gone, butchered by LSD crazed Mau-Maus who mistook them for a
meeting of the Washington chapter of the Policemen's Benevolent Association. The
President and a shadowy government-in-exile are skulking about Montreal, living
a gloomy emigre existence; the Blind Tigers, a rather thinly disguised
caricature of the Black Panthers, are terrorizing white women everywhere from
Bangor to Walla Walla; the crazy anarchists are forcing abortions</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">on women whether they want them
or not; and television shows nothing but Maoist propaganda and Danish stag
films. Women, of course, are the worst sufferers in this blightmare, and,
despite all her karate lessons, Taffy has been raped so many times, not only by
standard vage-pen but orally and anally as well, that she's practically a
walking sperm bank. Then comes the big surprise, the monstro-rape to end all
rapes, committed by a pure Aryan with hollow cheeks, a long lean body, and a
face that never changes expression. &quot;Everything is fire,&quot; he tells
her, as he pulls his prick out afterwards, &quot;and don't you ever forget
it.&quot; Then he disappears.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Well, it turns out that Taffy has
gone all icky-sticky-gooey over this character, and she determines to find him
again and make an honest man of him. Meanwhile, however, a subplot is brewing,
involving Taffy's</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">evil brother, Diamond Jim Rhinestone,
an unscrupulous dope pusher who is mixing heroin in his grass to make everybody
an addict and enslave them to him. Diamond Jim is allied with the sinister Blind
Tigers and a secret society, the Enlightened Ones, who cannot achieve world
government as long as a patriotic and paranoid streak of nationalism remains in
America.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But the forces of evil are being
stymied. A secret underground group has been formed, using the cross as their
symbol, and their slogan is appearing scrawled on walls everywhere:</span></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">SAVE YOUR FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES,
BOYS, THE STATE WILL RISE AGAIN!</span></b></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Unless this group is found and
destroyed, Diamond Jim will not be able to addict everyone to horse, the Blind
Tigers won't be able to rape the few remaining white women they haven't gotten
to yet, and the Enlightened Ones will not succeed in creating one world
government and one monotonous soybean diet for the whole planet. But a clue is
discovered: the leader of the Underground is a pure Aryan with hollow cheeks, a
long lean body, and a face that never changes expression. Furthermore, he is in
the habit of discussing Heracleitus for like seven hours on end (this is a neat
trick, because only about a hundred sentences of the Dark Philosopher
survive—but our hero, it turns out, gives lengthy comments on them).</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">At this point there is a major
digression, while a herd of minor characters get on a Braniff jet for
Ingol-stadt. It soon develops that the pilot is tripping on acid, the copilot is
bombed on Tangier hash and the stewardesses are all speed freaks and dykes, only
interested in balling each other. Atlanta then takes you through the lives of
each of the passengers and shows that the catastrophe that is about to befall
them is richly deserved: all, in one way or another, had helped, to create the
Dope Grope or Fucks Fix culture by denying the &quot;self-evident truth&quot; of
some hermetic saying </span>by Heracleitus. When the plane does a Steve Brodie
into the North Atlantic, everybody on board, including the acid-tripping Captain
Clark, are getting just what they merit for having denied that reality is really
fire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Taffy has hired a private detective named Mickey
&quot;Cocktails&quot; Molotov to search for her lost Aryan rapist with hollow
cheeks. Before I could get into that, however, I was wondering about the
synchronistic implications of the previous section, and called over one of the
stewardesses.</p>
<p>&quot;Could you tell me the pilot's name?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Namen?&quot; </i>she replied. <i>&quot;Ja, Gretchen.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;No, not your name,&quot; I said, &quot;the pilot's name. <i>Namen
wiser, </i>um, <i>Winginmacher?&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Winginmacher?&quot; </i>she repeated, dubiously, <i>&quot;Bin
Augenblick.&quot; </i>She went away, while I looked up <i>Augenblick </i>in a
pocket German-English dictionary, and another stewardess, with the identical
uniform, the identical smile and the identical blue eyes, came over, asking, <i>&quot;Was
wollen sie haben?&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>I </i>gave up on <i>Winginmacher, </i>obviously a bad guess. <i>&quot;Gibt
mir, bitte,&quot; I </i>said, <i>&quot;die Namen unser Fliegen-macher.&quot; I </i>spread
my arms, imitating the plane. <i>&quot;Luft Fliegenmacher,&quot; </i>I repeated,
adding helpfully, &quot;How about <i>Luft Piloten?&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;It's <i>Pilot, </i>not <i>Piloten,&quot; </i>she said with lots of
teeth. &quot;His name is Captain Clark. Heathcliffe Clark.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Danke— </i>Thanks,&quot; I said glumly, and returned to <i>Telemachus
Sneezed, </i>imagining friend Heathcliffe up front there weathering heights of
ttjwre-soaring and plunging into the ocean because, as Mallory said, it's there.
An Englishman piloting a kraut airline, no less, just to remind me that I'm
surrounded by the paradoxical paranoidal paranormal parameters of synchronicity.
Their wandering ministerial Eye. Lord, I buried myself again in Atlanta Hope's
egregious epic.</p>
<p>Cocktails Molotov, the private dick, starts looking for the Great American
Rapist, with only one clue: an architectural blueprint that fell out of his
pocket while he was tupping Taffy. Cocktails's method of investiga<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">tion
is classically simple: he beats up everybody he meets until they confess or
reveal something that gives him a lead. Along the way he meets an effete snob
type who makes a kind of William O. Douglas speech putting down all this
brutality. Molotov explains, for seventeen pages, one of the longest monologues
I ever read in a novel, that life is a battle between Good and Evil and the
whole modern world is corrupt because people see things in shades of
red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet instead of in clear black and white.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Meanwhile, of course, everybody is
still mostly involved in fucking, smoking grass and neglecting to invest their
capital in growth industries, so America is slipping backward toward what
Atlanta calls &quot;crapulous precapitalist chaos.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">At this point, another character
enters the book, Howard Cork, a one-legged madman who commands a submarine
called the <i>Life Eternal </i>and is battling <i>everybody—</i>the
anarchists, the Communists, the Diamond Jim Rhinestone heroin cabal, the Blind
Tigers, the Enlightened Ones, the U.S. government-in-exile, the still-nameless
patriotic Underground and the Chicago Cubs—since he is convinced</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">they are <i>all </i>fronting for
a white whale of superhuman intelligence who is trying to take over the world on
behalf of the cetaceans. (&quot;No normal whale could do this,&quot; he says
after every TV newscast reveals further decay and chaos in America, &quot;but a
whale of superhuman intelligence . . . !&quot;) This megalomaniac tub of
blubber—the whale, not Howard Cork—is responsible for the release of the
famous late-1960s record <i>Songs of the Blue Whales, </i>which has hypnotic
powers to lead people into wild frenzies, dope-taking, rape and loss of faith in
Christianity. In fact, the whale is behind most of the cultural developments of
recent decades, influencing minds through hypnotic telepathy. &quot;First, he
introduced W. C. Fields,&quot; Howard Cork rages to the dubious first mate,
&quot;Buck&quot; Star, &quot;then, when America's moral fiber was sufficiently
weakened, Liz and Dick and Andy</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Warhol and rock music. Now, the Songs
of the Blue Whales!&quot; Star becomes convinced that Captain Cork went uncorked
and wigged when he lost his leg during a simple ingrown toenail operation
bungled by a hip young chiropodist stoned on mescaline. This suspicion is
increased by the moody mariner's insistence on wearing an old cork leg instead
of a modern prosthetic model, proclaiming, &quot;I was born all Cork and I'm not
going to die only three-fourths Cork!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Then comes a turnabout scene, and it
is revealed that Cork is actually not bananas at all but really a smooth apple.
In a meeting with a pure Aryan with hollow cheeks, a long lean body, and a face
that never changes expression, it develops that the Captain is an agent of the
Underground which is called God's Lightning because of Heracleitus's idea that
God first manifested himself as a lightning bolt which created the world.
Instead of hunting the big white whale, as the crew thinks, the <i>Life Eternal </i>is
actually running munitions for the government-in-exile and God's Lightning. When
the hollow-cheeked leader leaves, he says to Cork, &quot;Remember: the <i>way up
</i>is the <i>way down.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Meanwhile, the Gateless Gate swung
creakingly open and I started picking up some of the &quot;real&quot; world.
That is, I began to recognize myself, again, as the ringmaster. All of this
information gets fed into me, entropy and negentropy all synergized up in a
wodge of wonderland, and I compute it as well as my memory banks give it unto me
to understand these doings.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But, as Harry Coin, I enter Miss
Portinari's suite somewhat diffidently. I am conscious of the ghosts of dead
pirates, only partly induced by this room's surrealist variety of Hagbard's
nautical taste in murals. In fact, Harry, in his own language, had an asshole
tight enough to shit bricks. It was easy, now, to accept that long-haired
hippie, George, and even his black girlfriend as equals, but it just didn't seem
right to be asked to accept a <i>teenage girl </i>as a superior. A couple days
ago I would have been thinking how to get into her panties. Now I was thinking
how to get her into my head. That Hagbard and his dope sure have screwed up my
sense of values worse than anything since I left Biloxi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And, for some
reason, I could hear the Reverend Hill pounding the Bible and hollering up a
storm back there in Biloxi, long ago, &quot;No remission without blood! No
remission without blood, brothers and sisters! Saint Paul says it and don't you
forget it! No remission without the blood of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
Amen.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And Hagbard reads
FUCKUP'S final analysis of the strategy and tactics in the Battle of Atlantis.
All the evidence is consistent with Assumption A, and inconsistent with
Assumption B, the mathematical part of FUCKUP has decided. Hagbard grinds his
teeth in a savage grimace: Assumption A is that the Illuminati spider ships were
under remote control, and Assumption B is that there were human beings aboard
them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">—Trust not a man
who's rich in flax—his morals may be sadly lax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Ready for
destruction of enemy ships,&quot; Howard's voice came back to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Are your
people out of the way?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Of course.
Quit this hesitating. This is no time to be a humanitarian.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(Assumption A is
that the Illuminati spider ships were under remote control.)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The sea is cruder
than the land. Sometimes.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(None of the
evidence is consistent with Assumption B.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard reached out
a brown finger, let it rest on a white button on the railing in front of him,
then pressed it decisively. <i>That's all there is to it, </i>he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But that wasn't all
there was to it. He had decided, coolly and in his wrong mind, that if he was a
murderer already the final gambit might as well be one that would salvage part
of the Demonstration. He had sent: George to Drake (Bob, you're dead now, but
did you ever understand, even for a moment, what I tried to tell you? What Jung
tried to tell you even earlier?) and then twenty-four real men and women were
dead, and now the bloodshed was escalating, and he wasn't sure that any part of
the Demonstration could be saved.</span></p>
<p><i>&quot;No</i> <i>remission -without blood! No remission without blood,
brothers and sisters </i>. . . <i>No remission without the blood of our Saviour
and Lord Jesus Christ!&quot;</i></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">got
into the Illuminati in 1951, when Joe McCarthy was riding high and everybody was
looking for conspiracies everywhere. In my own naive way (I was a sophomore at
New York University at the time) I was seeking to find myself, and I answered
one of those Rosicrucian ads in the back of a girlie magazine. Of course, the
Rosicrucians aren't a front in the simple way that the Birchers and other
paranoids think; only a couple of plants at AMORC headquarters are Illuminati
agents. But they select possible candidates at random, and we get slightly
different mailings than those sent to the average new member. If we show the
proper spirit, our mailings get more interesting and a personal contact is made.
Well, pretty soon I swore the whole oath, including that silly part about never
visiting Naples, which is just an expression of an old grudge of Weishaupt's,
and I was admitted as Illuminatus Minerval with the name Ringo Erigena. Since I
was majoring in law, I was instructed to seek a career in the FBI.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I met Eisenhower only once, at a very
large and sumptuous ball. He called another agent and myself aside. &quot;Keep
your eye on Mamie,&quot; he said. &quot;If she has five martinis, or starts
quoting John Wayne, get her upstairs <i>quick.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Kennedy I never even talked to, but
Winifred (whose name in the order is Scotus Pythagoras) used to bitch about him
a lot. &quot;This New Frontier stuff is dangerous,&quot; Winfred would say
testily. &quot;The man thinks he's living in a western movie. One big showdown,
and the bad guys bite the dust. We'd best not let him last too long.&quot;</span></p>
<p>You can imagine how upset I was when the Dallas caper began to throw light on
the whole overall pattern. Of course, I didn't know what to do: Winifred was my
only superior in the government who was also a superior in the Illuminati, but I
had a lot of hunches and guesses about some others, and I wouldn't want to bet
that John Edgar wasn't one of them, for instance. When the feeler came from the
CIA I went on what these kids today call a paranoid trip. It could have been
coincidence or synchronicity, but it could have been the Order, scanning me, and
ensuring that my involvement would get deeper.</p>
<p>(&quot;Most people in espionage don't know who they're working for,&quot;
Winifred told me once, in that voice of silk and satin and stilettos,
&quot;especially the ones who only do 'small jobs.' Suppose we find a French
Canadian separatist in Montreal who's in a position to provide certain
information at certain times. We certainly don't ask him to work for American
Intelligence. That's no concern of his, and even inimical to his real interests.
So he's approached by another very convincing French Canadian who has 'evidence'
to prove he's an agent of the most secret of all Quebec Libre underground
movements. Or, if the Russians find a woman in Nairobi who has access to certain
offices and happens to be anti-Communist and pro-English: no sense in trying to
recruit her for the MVD, right? The contact she meets has a full set of
credentials and just the right Oxford tone to convince her he's with M.5 in
London. And so it goes,&quot; he ended dreamily, &quot;so it goes . . .&quot;)</p>
<p>My CIA contact really was CIA; I'm almost absolutely willing to give odds
around 60-40 on that. At least, he knew the proper passwords to show that he was
acting under presidential orders, whatever that proves.</p>
<p>It was Hoover himself who ordered me to infiltrate God's Lightning. Well, he
didn't pick me alone; I was part of a group, and a rousing pep talk he gave us.
I can still remember him saying, &quot;Don't let their Americ<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">an
flags fool you. Look at those lightning bolts, right out of Nazi Germany, and,
remember, the next thing to a godless Commie is a godless Nazi. They're both
against Free Enterprise.&quot; Of course, as soon as I was admitted to the
Arlington chapter of God's Lightning, I found out that Free Enterprise stood
second only to Heracleitus in their pantheon. J. Edgar did get some queer
hornets in his headgear at times—like his fear that John Dillinger was really
still alive some place, laughing at him. That was the dread that turned him
against Melvin Purvis, the agent who gunned Dillinger down in Chicago, and he
rode Purvis right out of the Bureau. Those of you with long memories will recall
that poor Purvis ended up working for a breakfast cereal company, acting as
titular head of the Post-Toasties Junior G-Men.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It was in God's Lightning that I read
<i>Telemachus Sneezed, </i>which I still think is a rip-roaring good yarn. That
scene where Taffy Rhinestone sees the new King on television and it's her old
rapist friend with the gaunt cheeks and he says, &quot;My name is John
Guilt&quot;— man, that's <i>writing. </i>His hundred-and-three-page-long
speech afterwards, explaining the importance of guilt and showing why all the
anti-Heracleiteans and Freudians and relativists are destroying civilization by
destroying guilt, certainly is persuasive—especially to somebody like me with
three-going-on-four personalities each of which was betraying the others. I
still quote his last line, &quot;Without guilt there can be no
civilization.&quot; Her nonfiction book, <i>Militarism: The Unknown Ideal for
the New Heracleitean </i>is, I think, a distinct letdown, but the God's
Lightning bumper stickers asking &quot;What Is John Guilt?&quot; sure give
people the creeps until they learn the answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I met Atlanta Hope herself at the
time of the New York Draft Riots. That was, you will remember, when God's
Lightning, disgusted with reports that the FBI was swamped in two years' backlog
in draft resistance and draft evasion cases, decided to organize vigilante
groups to hunt down the hippie-yippie-commie-pacifist </span>scum themselves. As
soon as they entered the East Village—which harbored, as they suspected,
hundreds of thousands of bearded, long-haired and otherwise semi-visible
fugitives from the Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Taiwan, Costa Rica, Chile
and Tierra del Fuego conflicts—they began to encounter both suspects and
resistance. After the third hour, the Mayor ordered the police to cordon the
area. The police, of course, were on the side of God's Lightning and did all
they could to aid their mayhem against the Great Unwashed while preventing
reciprocal mayhem. After the third day, the Governor called out the National
Guard. The Guard, who were mostly draft-dodgers at heart themselves, tried to
even the score, and even help the Dregs and Drugs a bit. After the third week,
the President declared that part of Manhattan a disaster area and sent in the
Red Cross to help the survivors.</p>
<p>I was in the thick and din of it (you have no idea how bizarre civil war gets
when one side uses trash cans as a large part of their arsenal) and even met Joe
Malik, prematurely, under a Silver Wraith Rolls Royce where he had crawled to
take notes near the front line and I had crept to nurse wounds received while
being pushed through the window of the Peace Eye Bookstore—I have scars I
could show you still—and a voice over my shoulder says that I should put in
the fact that August Personage was trapped in a phone booth only a few feet
away, suffering hideous paranoid delusions that in spite of all this chaos the
police would trace his last obscene call and find him still in the .booth afraid
to come out and face the trash can covers and bullets and other miscellaneous
metals in the air—and I even remember that the Rolls had license plate RPD-1,
which suggests that a certain person of importance was also in that odd vicinity
on some doubtless even odder errand. I met Atlanta herself a day later and a
block north, on the scene where Taylor Mead was making his famous Last Stand.
Atlanta grabbed my right arm (the wounded one: it made me wince) and howled
some- thing like, &quot;Welcome, brother in the True Faith! War is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">the
Health of the State! Conflict is the creator of all things!&quot; Seeing she was
on a heavy Heracleitus wavelength, I quoted, with great passion, &quot;Men
should fight for the Laws as they would for the walls of the city!&quot; That
won her and I was Atlanta's Personal Lieutenant for the rest of the battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Atlanta remembered me from the Riots
and I was summoned to organize the first tactical strikes against Nader's
Raiders. If I do say so myself, I did a commendable job; it earned me a raise
from the Bureau, a tight but genuinely pleased smile from my CIA drop, a
promotion to Illuminatus Prelator from Winifred—and another audience with
Atlanta Hope which led to my initiation into the </span>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">,
the supersecret conspiracy for which she was really working. (The </span>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
is so arcane that even now I can't reveal the full name hinted in those
initials.) My secret name was Prince of Wands E; I got the Prince of Wands by
picking a Tarot card at random, and she gave me the E herself—from which I
deduced that there were four other Princes of Wands, together with five Kings of
Swords, and so forth, meaning that the </span>A<i><span style="font-size:
13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:. </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">was
something special in even esoteric realms, since it was a worldwide conspiracy
with no more than three hundred ninety members (five tunes the number of cards
in the Tarot deck). The name fairly suited me—I wouldn't want to be Hanged Man
D or Fool A—and I was happy that the Prince is known for his multiple
personalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">If I had been three and a half agents
before (my role in God's Lightning a fairly straightforward one, at least from
GL's point of view, since I was only asked to smash, not to spy) there was no
doubt that I was four agents now, belonging to the FBI, the CIA, the Illuminati
and the </span>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.
</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">and betraying each of them to
at least one and sometimes two or three of the others. (Yes, I had been
converted to the </span>A<i><span style="font-size:
13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:. </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">during
their initiation; if I could describe that most amazing ritual you would not
wonder why.) Then came the Vice President's brainstorm about economizing on
agents, and I began to get transferred on loan to the CIA fre</span>quently,
whereupon the Bureau discreetly asked me to report anything interesting that I
observed. This, however, I perceive as a further complexification of my four-way
psychic stretch and not as the inevitable, irrefragable and synergetic fifth
step.</p>
<p>And I was right. For it was only in the last year that I entered the terminal
stage, or <i>Grumment </i>as the Order calls it, due to those curious events
which led me from Robert Putney Drake to Hagbard Celine.</p>
<p>I was sent to the Council on Foreign Relations banquet carrying the
credentials of a Pinkerton detective; my supposed role as private dick was to
keep an eye on the jewels of the ladies and other valuables. My real job was to
place a small bug on the table where Robert Putney Drake would be sitting; I was
on loan to IRS that week, and they didn't know that Justice had standing orders
never to prosecute him for anything, so they were trying to prove he had
concealed income. Naturally, I also had an ear peeled for anything that might be
of import for the Illuminati, the A <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1026"

once that the Illuminati had reason to believe him part of an advance-guard
fifth column sent by invaders from Alpha Centauri—but Grand Masters of the
Illuminati are notorious put-on artists, and I didn't buy that yarn any more
than I bought the tale that had originally brought me into the Illuminati, the
one about them being a conspiracy to establish a world government run by British
Israelites.) Conspiracy was its own reward to me, now; I didn't care what I was

of the Great Work, for in the twisting labyrinths of my selves I was beginning
to find the rough sketch for a soul.</p>
<p>There was a hawk-faced wop at Drake's table, very elegant in a spanking new
tuxedo, but the cop in me <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">made him as
illegit. Sometimes you can make a subject precisely, as bunco-con, safe-blower,
armed robber or whatnot, but I could only place him vaguely somewhere on that
side of the game; in fact, I associated him with images of piracy on the high
seas or the kind of gambits the Borgias played. Somehow the conversation got
around to a new book by somebody named Mortimer Adler who had already written a
hundred or so great books if I understood the drift. One banker type at the
table was terribly keen on this Adler and especially on his latest great book.
&quot;He says that we and the Communists share the same Great Tradition&quot; (I
could hear the caps by the way he pronounced the term) &quot;and we must join
together against the one force that really does threaten
civilization—anarchism!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There were several objections, in
which Drake didn't take part (he just sat back, puffing his cigar and looking
agreeable to everyone, but I could see boredom under the surface) and the banker
tried to explain the Great Tradition, which was a bit over my head, and, judging
by the expressions around the table, a bit over everybody else's head, too, when
the hawk-faced dago spoke up suddenly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I can put the Great Tradition
in one word,&quot; he said calmly. &quot;Privilege.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Old Drake suddenly stopped looking
agreeable-but-bored—he seemed both interested and amused. &quot;One seldom
encounters such a refreshing freedom from euphemism,&quot; he said, leaning
forward. &quot;But perhaps I am reading too much into your remark, sir?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hawk-face sipped at his champagne and
patted his mouth with a napkin before answering. &quot;I think not,&quot; he
said at last. &quot;Privilege is defined in most dictionaries as a right or
immunity giving special favors or benefits to those who hold it. Another meaning
in Webster is 'not subject to the usual rules or penalties.' The invaluable
thesaurus gives such synonyms as power, authority, birthright, franchise,
patent, grant, favor and, I'm sad to say, pretension. Surely, we all know what
privilege is in <i>this </i>club, don't we, gentlemen? Do I have to</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt">
</span>remind you of the Latin roots, <i>privi, </i>private, and <i>lege, </i>law,
and point out in detail how we have created our Private Law over here, just as
the Politburo have created their own private law in their own sphere of
influence?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that's not the Great Tradition,&quot; the banker type said (later,
I learned that he was actually a college professor; Drake was the only banker at
that table). &quot;What Mr. Adler means by the Great Tradition—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What Mortimer means by the Great Tradition,&quot; hawk-face interrupted
rudely, &quot;is a set of myths and fables invented to legitimize or sugar-coat
the institution of privilege. Correct me if I'm wrong,&quot; he added more
politely but with a sardonic grin.</p>
<p>&quot;He means,&quot; the true believer said, &quot;the undeniable axioms,
the time-tested truths, the shared wisdom of the ages, the . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The myths and fables,&quot; hawk-face contributed gently.</p>
<p>&quot;The sacred, time-tested wisdom of the ages,&quot; the other went on,
becoming redundant. &quot;The basic bedrock of civil society, of civilization.
And we do share that with the Communists. And it is just that common humanistic
tradition that the young anarchists, on both sides of the Iron Curtain, are
blaspheming, denying and trying to destroy. It has nothing to do with privilege
at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon me,&quot; the dark man said. &quot;Are you a college
professor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly. I'm head of the Political Science Department at
Harvard!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; the dark man shrugged. &quot;I'm sorry for talking so bluntly
before you. I thought I was entirely surrounded by men of business and
finance.&quot;</p>
<p>The professor was just starting to look as if he spotted the implied insult
in that formal apology when Drake interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so. No need to shock our paid idealists and turn them into vulgar
realists overnight. At the same time, is it absolutely necessary to state what
we all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">know in such a manner as to imply
a rather hostile and outside viewpoint? Who are you and what is your trade,
sir?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hagbard Celine. Import-export.
Gold and Appel Transfers here in New York. A few other small establishments in
other ports.&quot; As he spoke my image of piracy and Borgia stealth came back
strongly. &quot;And we're not children here,&quot; he added, &quot;so why should
we avoid frank language?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The professor, taken aback a foot or
so by this turn in the conversation, sat perplexed as Drake replied:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;So. Civilization is
privilege—or Private Law, as you say so literally. And we all know where
Private Law comes from, except the poor professor here—out of the barrel of a
gun,' in the words of a gentleman whose bluntness you would appreciate. Is it
your conclusion, then, that Adler is, for all his naivete, correct, and we have
more in common with the Communist rulers than we have setting us at odds?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Let me <i>illuminate </i>you
further,&quot; Celine said—and the way he pronounced the verb made me jump.
Drake's blue eyes flashed a bit, too, but that didn't surprise me: anybody as
rich as IRS thought he was, would <i>have </i>to be On the Inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Privilege implies exclusion
from privilege, just as advantage implies disadvantage,&quot; Celine went on.
&quot;In the same mathematically reciprocal way, profit implies loss. If you and
I exchange equal goods, that is trade: neither of us profits and neither of us
loses. But if we exchange unequal goods, one of us profits and the other loses.
Mathematically. Certainly. Now, such mathematically unequal exchanges will
always occur because some traders will be shrewder than others. But in total
freedom—in anarchy—such unequal exchanges will be sporadic and irregular. A
phenomenon of unpredictable periodicity, mathematically speaking. Now look about
you, professor—raise your nose from your great books and survey the actual
world as it is—and you will not observe such unpredictable functions. You will
observe, instead, a mathematically smooth func</span>tion, a steady profit
accruing to one group and an equally steady loss accumulating for all others.
Why is this, professor? Because the system is not free or random, any
mathematician would tell you <i>a priori. </i>Well, then, where is the
determining function, the factor that controls the other variables? You have
named it yourself, or Mr. Adler has: the Great Tradition. Privilege, I prefer to
call it. When A meets B in the marketplace, they do not bargain as equals. A
bargains from a position of privilege; hence, he always profits and B always
loses. There is no more Free Market here than there is on the other side of the
Iron Curtain. The privileges, or Private Laws—the rules of the game, as
promulgated by the Politburo and the General Congress of the Communist Party on
that side and by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve Board on this
side—are slightly different; that's all. And it is this that is threatened by
anarchists, and by the repressed anarchist in each of us,&quot; he concluded,
strongly emphasizing the last clause, staring at Drake, not at the professor.</p>
<p>The professor had a lot more to say in a hurry then, about the laws of
society being the laws of nature and the laws of nature being the laws of God,
but I decided it was time to circulate a bit more so I didn't hear the rest of
the conversation. The IRS has a complete tape of it, I'm sure, since I had
placed the bug long before the meal.</p>
<p>The next time I saw Robert Putney Drake was a turning point. I was being sent
to New York again, on a mission for Naval Intelligence this time, and Winifred
gave me a message that had to be delivered to Drake personally; the Order
wouldn't trust any mechanical communication device. Strangely, my CIA drop also
gave me a message for Drake, and it was the same message. That didn't jar me
any, since it merely confirmed some of what I had begun to suspect by then.</p>
<p>I went to this office on Wall Street, near the corner of Broad (just about
where I'd be toiling at Corporate Law, if my family had had its way) and I told
his secretary, &quot;Knigge of Pyramid Productions to see Mr.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake.&quot; That was the password
that week; Knigge had been a Bavarian baron and second-in-command to Weishaupt
in the original AISB. I sat and cooled my heels awhile, studying the decor,
which was heavily Elizabethan and made me wonder if Drake had some private
notion about being a reincarnation of his famous ancestor.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Finally, Drake's door opened and who
stood there but Atlanta Hope, looking kind of wild-eyed and distraught. Drake
had his arm on her shoulder and he said piously, &quot;May your work hasten the
day when America returns to purity.&quot; She stumbled past me in a kind of daze
and I was ushered into his office. He motioned me to an overstuffed chair and
stared at my face until something clicked. &quot;Another Knigge in the
woodpile,&quot; he laughed suddenly. &quot;The last time I saw you, you were a
Pinkerton detective.&quot; You had to admire a memory like that; it had been a
year since the CFR banquet and I hadn't done anything to attract his attention
that night.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm FBI as well as being in the
Order,&quot; I said, leaving out a few things.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You're more than that,&quot; he
said flatly, sitting behind a desk as big as some kids' playgrounds. &quot;But I
have enough on my mind this week without prying into how many sides you're
playing. What' s the message?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It comes from the Order and the
CIA both,&quot; I said, to be clear and relatively above-board. &quot;This it
is: <i>The Taiwan heroin shipments will not arrive on time. The Laotian opium
fields are temporarily in the hands of the Pathet Lao. Don't believe the
Pentagon releases about our troops having the Laotian situation under control. </i>No
answer required.&quot; I started to rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Wait, damn it,&quot; Drake
said, frowning. &quot;This is more important than you realize.&quot; His face
went blank and I could tell his mind was racing like an engine with governor
off; it was impressive. &quot;What's your rank in the Order?&quot; he asked
finally.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Illuminatus Prelator,&quot; I
confessed, humbly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Not nearly high enough. But you
have more practical espionage experience than a great- many higher members.
You'll have to do.&quot; The old barracuda relaxed, having come to a decision.
&quot;How much do you know about the Cult of the Black Mother?&quot; he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The most militant and most
secret Black Power group in the country,&quot; I said carefully. &quot;They
avoid publicity instead of seeking it, because their strategy is based on an
eventual coup d'etat, not on revolution. Until a minute ago, I thought no white
man in the country even knew of their existence, except those of us in the FBI.
The Bureau has never reported on them to other government agencies, because
we're ashamed to admit we've never been able to keep an informer inside for
long. They all die of natural causes, that's what bugs us.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Nobody in the Order has ever
told you the truth?&quot; Drake demanded.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No,&quot; I said, curious.
&quot;I thought what I just told you was the truth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Winifred is more closed-mouth
than he needs to be,&quot; Drake said. &quot;The Cult of the Black Mother is
entirely controlled by the Order. They monitor ghetto affairs for us. Right now,
they predict a revival of 1960s-style uprisings for late summer in Harlem, on
the West Side of Chicago, and in Detroit. They need to up the addiction rate at
least eighteen percent, hopefully twenty or twenty-five percent, in all those
areas, or the property damage will be even more enormous than we are prepared to
absorb.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;They can't do it, if they have
to cut their present stock even more than it's already cut. There just has to be
more junk in the ghettoes or all hell will break loose by August.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I began to realize that he had used
the word &quot;monitor&quot; in its strict cybernetic meaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;There's only one
alternative,&quot; Drake went on. &quot;The black market. There's a very cunning
and well-organized group that's been trying to crack the CIA-Syndicate heroin
monopoly for quite a while now. The Cult, of the Black Mother will have to deal
with them directly. I don't want the Order involved at all—that would make it
messy, and besides we'll have to crush this group later, when we're able to
pierce their cover.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The upshot of it was that I found
myself on One Hundred Tenth Street in Harlem, feeling very white and
un-bulletproof, entering a restaurant called The Signifying Monkey. Walking
through a lot of hostile stares, I went direct to the coffee-colored woman at
the cash register and said, &quot;I've got a tombstone disposition.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">She gave me a piercing look and
muttered, &quot;Upstairs, after the men's room, the door marked Private. Knock
five times.&quot; She grinned maliciously, &quot;And if you're not kosher, kiss
your white ass good-bye, brother.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I went up the stairs, found the door,
knocked five times, and one eye in an ebony face looked out at me stonily.
&quot;White,&quot; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Man,&quot; I replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Native,&quot; he came back.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Born,&quot; I finished. A bolt
slipped on a chain and the door opened the rest of the way. I never did find out
whose idea of a joke that password was—they had lifted it from the Ku Klux
Klan, of course. The room I was in was heavy with marijuana smoke, but I could
see that it was decently furnished and dominated by an enormous statue of Kali,
the Black Mother; I had visions of weird <i>Gunga Din </i>rites and shouts of
&quot;Kill for the love of Kali!&quot; There were four other men in the room, hi
addition to the one who let me in, and two reefers were circulating, one deosil
and one widder-shins.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Who you from?&quot; a voice
asked in the murk.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;AISB,&quot; I answered
carefully, &quot;And I'm to speak to Hassan i Sabbah X.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You're speaking to him,&quot;
said the tallest and blackest character in the bunch, passing me a reefer. I
took a quick, deep draw and, Christ, it was good. I'd been half addicted ever
since the March on the Pentagon in 1967, where I walked right behind Norman</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mailer part of the way, and later
fell in with some hippies who were sitting on the steps smoking it. I say I was
half addicted since then, because two of me believe, as a loyal government
employee, that the old government publications claiming marijuana is addicting
must be true or the government wouldn't have printed them. Fortunately, the
other two of me know that it isn't addicting, so I don't go</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">through very bad withdrawal when
it's scarce.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I started to outline the situation to
Hassan i Sabbah X but the other joint came around, widdershins, and I took a
drag on that. &quot;A man could get stoned doing this,&quot; I said facetiously.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yeah,&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">a
satisfied black voice agreed in the gloom.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Well, by the time I explained the
problem to Hassan, I was so bombed that I immediately let him recruit me for the
next step, on his rationalization that a white man could handle it easier than a
black man. Actually, I was curious to contact this group of heroin pirates.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hassan wrote the address carefully.
&quot;Now, here's the passwords,&quot; he said. &quot;You say, 'Do what thou
wilt shall be the whole of the Law.' Don't say 'Do what you will'—they can't
stand anybody fucking around with the words, it has something to do with magic.
She replies, 'Love is the law, love under will.' Then you finish it with 'Every
man and every woman is a star.' Got it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">You can bet your ass I got it. I was
almost goggleeyed. It was the passwords of the </span>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:..</span></i></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;One more thing,&quot; Hassan
added, &quot;be sure to ask for Miss Mao, <i>not </i>Mama Sutra. Mama isn't
cleared for this.&quot;</span></p>

He didn't notice the preoccupied-looking red-headed young man who took the seat

or it might be something else entirely that Hagbard and FUCKUP had concocted in
the</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">ship's laboratory. Miss Portinari went on chanting:</span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Obediently, he continued to stare
into the aquamarine pool between them; she wore a yellow robe and sat placidly
in the lotus position.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(&quot;I've gotta know,&quot; he had
told her. &quot;I can't go around with two sets of memories and never be sure
which are real and which Hagbard just put in my head like a man puts a baby into
a woman. Did I kill all those people or didn't I?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You must be in the proper frame
of mind before you can accept the answer,&quot; she had replied remotely.)</span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Was she changing the chant or was it
the drug? He tried to keep calm and continue staring into the pool, as she had
ordered, but the porcelain design around it was changing. Instead of two
dolphins chasing each other's tails like the astrological sign of Pisces (the
age that was ending, according to Hagbard), it was now one long serpentlike
creature trying to swallow <i>its own </i>tail.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That's me, he thought. A lot of
people have told me I'm as thin and long as a snake.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And it's everybody else, too (he
realized suddenly). I'm seeing what George told me: the Self pursuing the Self
and trying to govern it, the Self trying to swallow the Self.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But as he stared, fascinated, the
pool turned red, blood red, the color of guilt, and he felt it reach out and try
to pull him down into it, into red oblivion, a void made flush.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It's alive,&quot; he screamed.
&quot;Jesus Motherfucking Christ!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Miss Portinari casually stirred the
pool, remote and calm, and its spiral inward slowly turned back to aquamarine.
Harry felt himself blushing, <i>it was only a hallucination, </i>and muttered,
&quot;Pardon my language, ma'am.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Don't apologize,&quot; she said
sharply. &quot;The most important truths always appear first as blasphemies or
obscenities. That's why every great innovator is persecuted. And the sacraments
look obscene, too, to an outsider. The eucharist is just sublimated cannibalism,
to the unawakened. When the Pope kisses the feet of the laity, he looks like an
old toe-queen to some people. The rites of Pan look like a suburban orgy. Think
about what you said. Since it has five words and fits the Law of Fives, it is
especially significant.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">This is a weird bunch, but they know
important things, Harry reminded himself. He looked deep into the blue spiral
and silently repeated to himself, &quot;It's alive, Jesus Motherfucking Christ,
it's alive . . .&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Jesus, looking strangely hawk-faced
and Hagbardian, rose from the pool. &quot;This is my <i>bodhi,&quot; </i>he
said, pointing. Harry looked and saw Buddha sitting beneath the bodhi-tree.
&quot;Tat TVam Asi,&quot; he said, and the falling leaves of the tree turned
into millions of TV sets all broadcasting the same Laurel and Hardy movie.
&quot;Now look what you made me do,&quot; Hardy was saying ... In a previous
incarnation, Harry saw himself as a centurion, Semper Cuni Linctus, driving the
nails into the cross. &quot;Look,&quot; he said to Jesus, &quot;nothing
personal. I'm only following orders.&quot; &quot;So am I,&quot; Jesus said,
&quot;My Father's orders. Aren't we all?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Look into the pool,&quot; Miss
Portinari repeated. &quot;Just look into the pool.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It was like each Chinese box had
another Chinese box inside it; but the best of all belonged to Miss Mao Tsu-hsi.
We were reclining in her trim but elegant pad on West Eighty-seventh Street,
passing a joint back and forth and comparing multiple identities. We were naked
on a bearskin rug, a dream come true, for she was my ideal woman. &quot;I got
into the </span>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.
</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">first, Tobias,&quot; she was
saying. &quot;They recruited me at a Ba'Hai meeting—they have cruisers out,
looking for likely prospects, in every mystical group from Subud to Scientology,
you know. Then Naval Intelligence contacted me and I reported to them on what
the </span>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.
</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">was up to. I'm not flexible
as you, though, and my loyalties tend to stay fairly constant—chiefly I was
reporting to </span>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">what
I gleaned from Naval Intelligence. I did believe in the </span>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.
</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">basically. Until I met <i>Him&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That reminds me,&quot; I said,
jealous of the worshipful way she said <i>Him </i>as if talking about a god.
&quot;If he's coming soon, shouldn't we get up and put some clothes on?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;If you want to be
bourgeois,&quot; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">While we were dressing, I remembered
something. &quot;By the way,&quot; I asked casually, &quot;who are you spying on
Mama Sutra for—the </span>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">,
Naval Intelligence, or <i>Him?&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;All three of them.&quot; She
was starting to pull her panties on, and I said suddenly, &quot;Wait.&quot; I
knelt and kissed her pussy one last time, &quot;For the nicest Chinese box I've
opened in this whole case,&quot; I said gallantly. That was my Illuminati
training; as an FBI man, I was ashamed of such a perverted act.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">We finished dressing and she was
pouring some wine (a light German vintage from, of all places, Bavaria) when the
knock came.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Miss Mao sidled over to the door in
her slinky Chinese dress and said softly, &quot;Hail Eris.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;All hail Discordia,&quot; came
a voice from outside. She slipped the lock and a little fat man walked in. My
first reaction was astonishment; he didn't look anything like the
superintellectual superhero she had described.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hagbard couldn't come,&quot; he
said briefly. &quot;I'll handle the sale, and initiate <i>you&quot; </i>with a
glance at me,</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt"> </span>&quot;into the Legion
of Dynamic Discord, if you're really ready, as Miss Mao says, to battle every
government on earth and the Illuminati to boot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm ready,&quot; I said passionately. &quot;I'm tired being a puppet on
four sets of strings.&quot; (Actually, I know I just wanted a fifth set.)</p>
<p>&quot;Good,&quot; he said. &quot;Put her there,&quot; and he held out his
hand. As we shook, he said, <i>&quot;Episkopos </i>Jim Cart-wright of the Mad
Dog Cabal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tobias Knight,&quot; I said, &quot;of the FBI, the CIA, the A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>
and the Illuminati.&quot;</p>
<p>He blinked briefly. &quot;I've met double agents and triple agents, but
you're the first quadruple agent in my experience. I guess this was inevitable,
by the Law of Fives. Welcome to the fifth ring of the world's oldest continuous
Five Ring Circus. Prepare for Death and Rebirth.&quot;</p>
