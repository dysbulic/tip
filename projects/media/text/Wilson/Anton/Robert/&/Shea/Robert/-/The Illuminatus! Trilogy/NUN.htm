<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">THE CHARACTERS</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PURPLE SAGE. An imaginary Chaoist philospher invented by Lord Omar
Khayyam Ravenhurst (another imaginary Chaoist philosopher).</p>
<p>LORD OMAR KHAYAM RAVENHURST. An imaginary Chaoist philosopher invented by Mr.
Kerry Thornley of Atlanta, Georgia. Mr. Thornley was a friend of Lee Harvey
Oswald's, was accused of complicity in the John Kennedy assassination by
District Attorney Jim Garrison, and is the author of <i>llluminati Lady, </i>an
endless epic poem which you really ought to read.</p>
<p>GEORGE DORN. His maternal grandfather, old Charlie Bishop, was once a patient
of the famous Doctor William Carlos Williams. The Bishops came to New Jersey in
1723, having left Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692 under something of a cloud.
Folks in the Nutley-Clifton-Passaic-Paterson area always have a good word for
the Bishops, though. But the Dorns were all troublemakers, and George's paternal
grandfather, Big Bill Dora, was so indiscreet as to get killed by cops during
the Paterson silk-mill strike of 1922.</p>
<p>HERACLEITUS. He was apt to say odd things. Once he even wrote that
&quot;Religious ceremonies are unholy.&quot; A strange duck.</p>
<p>THE SQUIRREL. A set of receptor organs transmitting information through a
central nervous system to a small</p>
<p>brain programmed for only a few rudimentary decisions—but, in this, he was
not far inferior to most of our characters.</p>
<p>REBECCA GOODMAN. Her maiden name was Murphy, and she was named after Rebecca
of Sunnybrook Farm. You thought she was Jewish, didn't you?</p>
<p>THE DEAD EGYPTIAN MOUTH-BREEDERS. There were five of them, of course.</p>
<p>DANNY PRICEFIXER. Shot in the line of duty two years after the events of this
story. Loved the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>
<p>ADAM WEISHAUPT. &quot;He's a deep one,&quot; they used to say on the faculty
of the University of Ingolstadt, &quot;you never know what he's really
thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>CARMEL. One of his girls once cajoled a Hollywood character actor into
calling him on the phone and pretending to be a researcher for the Kinsey
Institute, seeking an interview. Carmel couldn't see any money in it and was
trying to end the conversation when the actor asked stuffily, &quot;Well, all we
want to know, actually, is do you have intercourse with your mother regularly,
or does everybody in Las Vegas call you 'Carmel the Motherfucker' for some other
reason?&quot; For once Carmel was speechless. The girl spread the story, and
everybody in town was laughing about it for weeks.</p>
<p>PETER JACKSON. His great-grandfather was a slave. His son became the first
President of the Luna Federation after the rebellion of the moon colonists in
2025. Much further back, a more remote ancestor was a king of Atlantis; and way
in the future, a descendant was a slave on a planet in the Alpha Centauri
system. (Peter was one of the crew when Hagbard finally blasted off for the
stars in 1999). that's the way the cookie crumbles; and Peter had an intuitive
sense of this paradoxical fatality, which caused him to tell Eldridge Cleaver
once, &quot;People who say 'You're either part of the solution or part of the
problem* are themselves part of the problem.&quot; (Cleaver replied, wittily,
&quot;Fuck you.&quot;)</p>
<p>THE LAB CHIEF WHO WAS DISINTERESTED IN ANTHRAX LEPROSY DELTA. He later
cracked up and wrote letters to the newspapers attacking the entire
chemobiological warfare program of the United States government. Spent the last
seventeen years of his life receiving treatment in St. Elizabeth's Hospital in
Washington, D.C., occupying the same quarters that once housed the ingenious
poet Ezra Pound. His rantings were taken seriously in certain places, especially
among some leftward-leaning fellow scientists, but the Vice-President described
them to the press as &quot;the despondent demagogy of a paranoid pedant.&quot; A
sample of the man's delusions, from a letter to the three top television
networks (never quoted on newscasts because it was too controversial): &quot;The
boast of the 19th century was its conquest of these accursed plagues that attack
men, women, and helpless infants indifferently. What shall be said of the 20th
century, which has recreated them, at great expense and through the efforts of
thousands of brilliant but perverted scientific minds, and then stored them <i>live
</i>in installations throughout the country, where it is virtually certain,
statistically, that an accident will unleash them upon an unsuspecting public,
sooner or later?&quot; (Loonies often harbor morbid fears of that sort.) The
poor man never responded favorably to any of the efforts of his psychiatrists,
even though they gave him ECT (electro-convulsive therapy) so often that his
brain was practically fried to the crispness of a Howard Johnson omelette by the
time he finally died.</p>
<p>ANTHRAX LEPROSY DELTA. A life form that could exist only by destroying other
life-forms; in this respect, it was like many of us. The first of the products
of Charlie Mocenigo's fertile genius, it could boast only of being ten times as
deadly as ordinary anthrax. Insofar as it had consciousness, in a vague and
flickering way, it was like that inhabiting a subway train at 5 P.M., concerned
only with getting where it was going and then eating. The other strains were
much the same, up to Anthrax Leprosy Pi.</p>
<p>LEE HARVEY OSWALD. Hero of a series of novels by Harold Weissburg, including <i>Whitewash,
Whitewash II, Photographic Whitewash, </i>and <i>Oswald in New Orleans. </i>Villain
of another novel, entitled <i>Report of the Presidential Commission on the
Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, </i>by Earl Warren, John McCone, et
al. Also featured in other works of fiction by Mark Lane, Penn Jones, Josiah
Thompson, and various other writers.</p>
<p>JACK RUBY. The Oliver Hardy to Oswald's Stanley Laurel.</p>
<p>THOMAS JEFFERSON. A revolutionary hemp-grower who once wrote, &quot;[The
clergy] believe that any portion of power confided to me, will be exerted in
opposition to their schemes. And they believe rightly: <i>for I have sworn upon
the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind
of man. </i>But this is all they have to fear from me: and enough too in their
opinion.&quot; Few of the pious tourists who read the italicized portion of this
statement carved on the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., are aware of its
context.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">THE SCHIZOPHRENIC IN CHERRY KNOLLS
HOSPITAL.</span><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt"> </span></b>His number was
124C41. Nobody, anywhere, remembered what his name had been.</p>
<p>MARY LOU SERVIX. She finally married Jim Riley, the dope dealer from Dayton
—but that's another, rather longish, story, and not truly relevant.</p>
<p>MAYOR RICHARD DALEY. Author of such immortal aphorisms as &quot;After all, I
am a liberal myself (October 22, 1968); &quot;The policeman isn't there to
create disorder, the policeman is there to preserve disorder&quot; (September
23, 1968); &quot;I have conferred with the Superintendent of Police this morning
and I gave him instructions that an order be issued by him immediately and under
his signature to shoot to kill any arsonist or anyone with a Molotov cocktail in
his hand&quot; (April 17, 1968); &quot;There wasn't any shoot-to-kill order.
That was a fabrication&quot; (April 18, 1968); &quot;You could say Senator Tower
is doing a lousy job, but I don't use that kind of words&quot; (May 1, 1962);
&quot;I have lived in Chicago all my life and I still say we have no ghetto in
Chicago&quot; (July 8, 1963); &quot;We will have a planned development and will
take people out of the ghettos and slums and give them an opportunity to raise
their families in decent surroundings&quot; (April 17, 1969); &quot;I didn't
create the slums, did I?&quot; (September 3, 1968); &quot;Together we must rise
to ever higher and higher platitudes&quot; (March 13, 1967).</p>
<p>THE RUSSIAN PREMIER. A comsymp.</p>
<p>CHARLES MOCENIGO'S FATHER. A professional. He worked</p>
<p>for Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchal-ter,
Federico Maldonado, and many other colorful American businessmen. Known in the
trade as Jimmy the Shrew, because of his sharp, conniving expression. Saved his
money, put his boy through MIT, killed people for a living. Found the original
Frank Sullivan performing in Havana, 1934.</p>
<p>GENERAL LAWRENCE STEWART TALBOT. Actually, there was something between him
and that girl from Red Lion, Penn.</p>
<p>MALACLYPSE THE YOUNGER, K.S.C. Author of the <i>Principia Discordia. </i>Disappeared
mysteriously in late 1970. His last recorded words were, typically, &quot;Comes
the dawn, the sun shall rise in the west.&quot; Then he walked into the Pacific
Ocean.</p>
<p>JOHN HERBERT DILLINGER. When Simon Moon read his biography in search of 23s,
he missed a good one: John committed 26 robberies during his publicized career,
but only 23 were for money. The other 3 (police stations) seem to have been
strictly Art For Art's Sake.</p>
<p>SIMON'S FATHER. Tim Moon. He told Simon the lives of Joe Hill, Big Bill
Haywood, Sacco and Vanzetti, and Frank Little at the age when most boys are
being told about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Simon remembers: Joe Hill the
night before his execution, wiring Wobbly headquarters in Chicago, &quot;Don't
weep for me, boys: organize.&quot; Bartolomeo Vanzetti: &quot;Your laws, your
courts, your false god will be a dim remembering of a cursed time when man was
wolf to the man.&quot; Tim and his cronies singing in the living room,
&quot;Which side are you on, man / Which <i>side </i>are you <i>on?&quot;</i>
until Molly complained, &quot;You'll wake the neighbors.&quot; Tim explaining
Big Bill: &quot;Oh, yes, and he had a glass eye. Funny I should forget that. The
real eye was knocked out by a cop during a strike.&quot; But you'll understand
Tim best if you see Simon, age six, entering grammar school for the first time
and addressing the first boy he meets: &quot;I'm Simon Moon; what's your name,
Fellow Worker?&quot;</p>
<p>PADRE PEDERASTIA. His real name was Father James Flanagan.</p>
<p>TOBIAS KNIGHT. The only quintuple agent in the history of espionage.</p>
<p>JAMES JOYCE. After death, he met Yeats on the fifth plane and said,
&quot;Sir, I am now willing to learn from you, since you appear to have been
right about Death after all.&quot; Yeats replied, &quot;Not at all. You're
dreaming this.&quot; The remark so vexed Joyce that he immediately sought
reincarnation (the fifth plane was full of mystics like Yeats and George Russell
and Madame Blavatski, and Joyce knew his rational Aristotelian sensibility would
be constantly abused by further conversation with them), entered the womb of
Elizabeth Mullins of Ver-non, New Jersey, October 11, 1942, and was aborted
December 10, 1942. Entered the womb of Rachel Stein of Ingolstadt, January 18,
1943, and was gassed with her, one month before birth was due, at Ausch-witz,
September 1, 1943. Thereafter, he retired to a monastery on the sixth plane and
wrote his funniest, most bitter book. Parts of it, which he has been
transmitting ever since, have been picked up by mediums on the six continents,
all of whom assumed they were flipping out and refused to transcribe it.</p>
<p>CHARLES WORKMAN. An entrepreneur.</p>
<p>MENDY WEISS. Another entrepreneur.</p>
<p>JIMMY THE SHREW. A third entrepreneur, more successful than the above. See
entry under CHARLES MOCENIGO'S <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">FATHER</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt">.</span></p>
<p>ALBERT &quot;THE TEACHER&quot; STEIN. Not only did he lose his gamble with
immortality when it was proven that he <i>didn't </i>kill Dutch Schultz, but
almost every book on the case misspells his name as Stern, a tradition which the
present work has mostly refused to shatter.</p>
<p>HENRY FORD. By importing the <i>Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion </i>and
beginning the mass production of automobiles, he managed to pollute both the
mind and the air of the United States, but he meant well, or at least he meant
something.</p>
<p>GEORGE DORN'S OLDER BROTHER. His successful scientific career made George
envious (and helped determine George's choices of a liberal-arts curriculum at
Columbia). He had an adventure with talking dolphins before George did (which
set up a psychic resonance that made George's recruitment interesting to
Hagbard); this story is recounted in <i>Tales Of the Cthulhu Mythos, </i>edited
by August Derleth (Arkham House, 1969).</p>

mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">MARKOFF CHANEY. He slipped away from Saul and Barney
shortly after they returned to Las Vegas, and none of our characters ever saw
him again. However, one day in 1984 Hagbard Celine, using an alias and engaged
in nefarious business, happened to be in the U.S. Government Printing Office on
Capitol Street in Washington and noticed a bundle of pamphlets that had been
stamped with both blue TOP SECRET: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY and red FOR
IMMEDIATE RELEASE TO ALL MEDIA. Many loyal government servants would have
headaches before it was ever clarified who had been responsible for which of
those stamps—if, indeed, that ever could be clarified. Hagbard recalled much
that Saul had told him about the Las Vegas caper and looked around thoughtfully.
In one corner he saw a large coffee urn. He lit one of his long black cigars and
strolled out into the street. The sun was bright, the air was clear, and it was
Spring, which may explain why Hagbard began whistling as he walked with a brisk
and determined pace toward the Senate Office Building. The tune was &quot;My
Heart's in the Highlands.&quot;</span>
