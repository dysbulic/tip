<p>—Lord Omar Khayaam Ravenhurst,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lights flashed; the computer buzzed. Hagbard attached the electrodes.</p>
<p>On January 30, 1939, a silly little man in Berlin gave a silly little speech;
among other things, he said: &quot;And another thing I wish to say on this day
which perhaps is memorable not only for us Germans: in my life I have many times
been a prophet and most of the times I have been laughed at. During the period
of my struggle for power, it was in the first case the Jews that laughed at my
prophecies that some day I would take over the leadership of the State and
thereby of the whole folk and that I would among other things solve also the
Jewish problem. I believe that in the meantime the hyenalike laughter of the
Jews of Germany has been smothered in their throats. Today I want to be a
prophet once more: if the international-finance Jews inside and outside Europe
should succeed once more in plunging nations into another world war the
consequence will be the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe.&quot; And so
on. He was always saying things like that. By 1939 quite a few heads here and
there realized that the silly little man was also a murderous little monster,
but only a very small number even of these noticed that for the first time in
his anti-Semitic diatribes he had used the word <i>Vernichtung—</i>annihilation—and
even they couldn't believe he meant what that implied. In fact, outside of a
small circle of friends, nobody guessed what the little man, Adolf Hitler, had
planned.</p>
<p>Outside that small—very small—circle of friends, others came in intimate
contact with <i>der Fuhrer </i>and never</p>
<p>guessed what was in his mind. Hermann Rauschning, the Governor of Danzig, for
instance, was a devout Nazi until he began to get some hints of where Hitler's
fancies were tending; after fleeing to France, Rauschning wrote a book warning
against his former leader. It was called <i>The Voice of Destruction </i>and was
very eloquent, but the most interesting passages in it were not understood by
Rauschning or by most of his readers. &quot;Whoever sees in National Socialism
nothing but a political movement doesn't know much about it,&quot; Hitler told
Rauschning, and this is in the book, but Rauschning and his readers continued to
see National Socialism as a particularly vile and dangerous <i>political
movement </i>and nothing more. &quot;Creation is not yet completed,&quot; Hitler
said again; and Rauschning again recorded, without understanding. &quot;The
planet will undergo an upheaval which you uninitiated people can't
understand,&quot; <i>der Fuhrer </i>warned on another occasion; and, still
another time, he remarked that Nazism was, not only more than a political
movement, but &quot;more than a new religion&quot;; and Rauschning wrote it all
and understood none of it. He even recorded the testimony of Hitler's physician
that the silly and murderous little man often awoke screaming from nightmares
that were truly extraordinary in their intensity and would shout, &quot;It's
HIM, it's HIM, HE'S come for me!&quot; Good old Hermann Rauschning, a German of
the old school and not equipped to participate in the New Germany of National
Socialism, took all this as evidence of mental unbalance in Hitler....</p>
<p><i>All of them coming back, all of them. Hitler and Streicher and Goebbels
and the powers behind them what look like something you can't even imagine,
guvnor...</i>.</p>
<p><i>You think they was human, </i>the patient went on as the psychiatrist
listened in astonishment, <i>but wait till you see them the second time. And
they're coming—By the end of the month, they're coming....</i></p>
<p>Karl Haushofer was never tried at Nuremberg; ask most people to name the men
chiefly responsible for the <i>Vernichtung </i>(annihilation) decision, and his
name will not be mentioned; even most histories of Nazi Germany relegate him to
footnotes. But strange stories are told about his many visits to Tibet, Japan,
and other parts of the Orient; his gift for prophecy and clairvoyance; the
legend that he belonged to a bizarre sect of dissident and most peculiar
Buddhists, who had entrusted him with a mission in the Western world so serious
that he vowed to commit suicide if he did not succeed. If the last yarn is true,
Haushofer must have failed in his mission, for in March 1946 he killed his wife
Martha and then performed the Japanese suicide-rite of <i>sepukku </i>upon
himself. His son, Albrecht, had already been executed for his role in the
&quot;officer's plot&quot; to assassinate Hitler. (Of his father, Albrecht had
written in a poem: &quot;My father broke the seal/He did not feel the breath of
the Evil One/He set It free to roam the world!&quot;)</p>
<p>It was Karl Haushofer, clairvoyant, mystic, medium, Orientalist, and fanatic
believer in the lost continent of Thule, who introduced Hitler to the
Illuminated Lodge in Munich, in 1923. Shortly thereafter, Hitler made his first
bid to seize power.</p>
<p>No rational interpretation of the events of August 1968 in Chicago,
satisfactory to all participants and observers, has yet been produced. This
suggests the need for value-free models, inspired by the structural analysis in
von Neumann and Morgenstern's <i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, </i>which
will allow us to express what actually occurred functionally, without tainting
our analysis with bias or moral judgments. The model we will employ is that of
two teams, an uphill motorcar race and a downhill bicycle race, accidentally
intersecting on the same hill. The Picasso statue in the Civic Center will be
regarded as &quot;start&quot; for the downhill motorcar race and
&quot;finish&quot; for the uphill bicycle race. Pontius Pilate, disguised as
Sirhan Sirhan, fires the opening shot, thereby disqualifying Robert F. Kennedy,
for whom Marilyn Monroe committed suicide, as recorded in the most trustworthy
tabloids and scandal sheets.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THIS IS THE VOICE OF YOUR FRIENDLY
NEIGHBORHOOD SPIDER MAN SPEAKING. YOU MUST REALIZE THAT YOU ARE NOT JOSEPH
WENDELL MALIK.</span></b></p>
<p>Hell's Angels on motorcycles do not fit the structure of the race at all, so
they endlessly orbit around the heroic statue of General Logan in Grant Park
(&quot;finish&quot; for the uphill crucifixion racers) and can be considered as
isolated from the &quot;action,&quot; which is, of course, America.</p>
<p>When Jesus falls the first time, this can be considered as a puncture and
Simon operates an air pump on his tires, but the threat to throw LSD in the
water supply constitutes a &quot;foul&quot; and this team thereby is driven back
three squares</p>
<p>by Mace, clubs, and the machine guns of the Capone mob unleashed from another
time track in the same multiverse. Willard Gibbs, far more than Einstein,
created the modern cosmos, and his concept of contingent or statistical reality,
when cross-fertilized with the Second Law of Thermodynamics by Shannon and
Wiener, led to the definition of information as the negative reciprocal of
probability, making the clubbings of Jesus by Chicago cops just another of those
things that happens in this kind of quantum jump.</p>
<p>A centurion named Semper Cuni Linctus passes Simon in Grant Park looking for
the uphill bike race. &quot;When we crucify a man,&quot; he mutters, &quot;he
should confounded well <i>stay </i>crucified.&quot; The three Marys clutch
handkerchiefs to their faces as the teargas and Zyklon B pours upward on the
hill, to the spot where the crosses and the statue of General Logan stand. . . .
&quot;Nor dashed a thousand kirn,&quot; croons Saint Toad looking through the
door at Fission Chips. . . . Arthur Flegenheimer and Robert Putney Drake ascend
the chimney. . . . &quot;You don't have to believe in Santa Claus,&quot; H. P.
Lovecraft explains. . . . &quot;Ambrose,&quot; the Dutchman says to him
imploringly.</p>
<p>&quot;But it can't be,&quot; Joe Malik says, half weeping. &quot;It can't be
that crazy. Buildings wouldn't stand. Planes wouldn't fly. Dams would collapse.
Engineering colleges would be lunatic asylums.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They aren't already?&quot; Simon asks. &quot;Have you read the latest
data on the ecological catastrophe? You have to face it, Joe. God is a crazy
woman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are no straight lines in curved space,&quot; Stella adds.</p>
<p>&quot;But my mind is dying,&quot; Joe protests, shuddering.</p>
<p>Simon holds up an ear of corn and tells him urgently, &quot;Osiris is a black
god!&quot;</p>
<p>(Sir Charles James Napier, bearded, long-haired and sixty-odd years old,
General of Her Majesty's Armies in India, met a most engaging scoundrel in
January 1843 and immediately wrote to his cronies in England about this
remarkable person, whom he described as brave, clever, fabulously wealthy, and
totally unscrupulous. Since this curious fellow was also regarded as God by his
followers, who numbered over three million, he charged twenty rupees for
permission to kiss his hand, asked—and. got—the sexual favors of the wives
or daughters of any True Believers who took his fancy, and proved his divinity
by brazenly</p>
<p>and openly committing sins which any mortal would shrivel with shame to have
acknowledged. He also proved, at the Battle of Miani, where he aided the British
against the rebellious Baluchi tribesmen, that he could fight like ten tigers.
All in all, General Napier concluded, a most unusual human being—Hasan ali
Shah Mahallat, forty-sixth Imam, or living God, of the Ishmaelian sect of Islam,
direct descendant of Hassan i Sabbah, and first Aga Khan.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Joe:</p>
<p>I'm back in Czechago again, fabulous demesne of Crookbacked Richard,
pigbaschard of the world, etc., where the pollution comes up like thunder out of
Gary across the lake, etc., and the Padre and I are still working on the heads
of the local Heads, etc., so I've finally got tune to write you that long letter
I promised.</p>
<p>The Law of Fives is all the farther that Weishaupt ever got, and Hagbard and
John aren't much interested in any further speculations along those lines. The
23/17 phenomenon is entirely my discovery, except that William S. Burroughs has
noted the 23 without coming to any conclusions about it.</p>
<p>I'm writing this on a bench in Grant Park, near the place I got maced three
years ago. Nice symbolism.</p>
<p>A woman just came along from the Mothers March Against Polio. I gave her a
quarter. What a drag, just when I was trying to get my thoughts in order. When
you come out here, I'll be able to tell you more; this will obviously have to be
somewhat sketchy.</p>
<p>Burroughs, anyway, encountered the 23 in Tan-giers, when a ferryboat captain
named Clark remarked that he'd been sailing 23 years without an accident. That
day, his ship sunk, with all hands and feet aboard. Burroughs was thinking about
it in the evening when the radio newscast told him that an Eastern Airlines
plane, New York to Miami, had crashed. The pilot was another Captain Clark and
the plane was Flight 23.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want to know the extent of their control,&quot; Simon told Joe
(speaking this time, not writing a letter; they were driving to San Francisco
after leaving Dillinger), &quot;take a dollar bill out of your wallet and look
at it. Go ahead—do it now. I want to make a point.&quot; Joe took out his
wallet and looked for a single. (A year later, in the city Simon called Czechago
in honor of the synchronous invasions in August 1968, the KCUF convention is
taking its first luncheon break after Smiling Jim's sock-it-to-'em opening
speech. Simon brushes against an usher, shouts, &quot;Hey, you damned faggot,
keep your hands off my ass,&quot; and in the ensuing tumult Joe has no trouble
slipping the AUM in the punch.)</p>
<p>&quot;Do I have to get a library card just to look at one book?&quot; Carmel
asks the librarian in the Main Branch of the Las Vegas Library, after Maldonado
had failed to produce any lead to a communist agent.</p>
<p><i>&quot;One of the most puzzling acts of Washington's Presidency,&quot;
Professor Percival Petsdeloup tells an American history class at Columbia, back
in '68, &quot;was his refusal to aid Tom Paine when Paine was condemned to death
in Paris&quot; </i>. . . <i>Why puzzling? George Dorn thinks in the back of the
class, Washington was an Establishment fink. , . . </i>&quot;First of all, look
at that face on the front,&quot; Simon says. &quot;It isn't Washington at all,
it's Weishaupt. Compare it with any of the early, authentic pictures of
Washington and you'll see what I mean. And look at that cryptic half-smile on
his face.&quot; <i>(The same smile Weishaupt wore when he finished the letter
explaining to Paine why he couldn't help him; sealed it with the Great Seal of
the United States whose meaning only he knew; and settling back in his chair,
murmured to himself, &quot;Jacques De Molay, thou art again avenged!&quot;)</i></p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, I'm creating a disturbance? It was that faggot there,
with his big mitts on my ass.&quot;</p>
<p><i>(&quot;Well, I don't know which particular book, honey. Something that
tells how the communists work. You know, how a patriotic citizen can spot a
commie spy ring if there's one in his neighborhood. That kind of thing,&quot;
Carmel explained.)</i></p>
<p>A swarm of men in blue shirts and white plastic helmets rushes down the steps
at Forty-third Street and UN Plaza, past the inscription reading, &quot;They
shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks,
neither shall they study war any more.&quot; Waving heavy wooden crosses and
shouting angry battle cries, the helmeted men surge into the crowd like a wave
hitting a sand castle. George sees them coming, and his heart skips a beat.</p>
<p><i>&quot;And when you turn the bill over, the first thing you see is the
Illuminati pyramid. You'll notice it says seventeen seventy-six on it, but our
government was founded in seventeen eighty-eight. Supposedly, the seventeen
seventy-six is there because that's when the Declaration of Independence was
signed. The real reason is that seventeen seventy-six is the year Weishaupt
revived the Illuminati. And why do you suppose the pyramid has seventy-two
segments in thirteen layers?&quot; Simon asks in nineteen sixty-nine. . </i>. .
&quot;Misunderstanding, my eye! When a guy gropes my butt that way I understand
exactly what he wants,&quot; Simon shouts in nineteen seventy. . . . <i>George
nudges Peter Jackson. &quot;God's Lightning,&quot; he says. The plastic hats
gleam in the sunlight, more of them jostling down the stairs, a banner, red
letters on a white background unfurling above: </i>&quot;AMERICA: LOVE IT OR
WE'LL STOMP YOU. . . . <i>&quot;Christ on rollerskates,&quot; Peter says,
&quot;now watch the cops do a vanishing act.&quot; . . . </i>Dillinger settles
down cross-legged in a five-sided chamber under the UN meditation room. He curls
into the lotus posture with an ease that would appear unusual in an American in
his late sixties were there anyone to witness it.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Seventy-two is the cabalistic number for the Holy Unspeakable Name
of God, used in all black magic, and thirteen is the number in a coven,&quot;
Simon explains. &quot;That's why.&quot; The Volkswagen purrs toward San
Francisco.</i></p>
<p>Carmel comes down the steps of the Las Vegas Public Library, a copy of J.
Edgar Hoover's <i>Masters of Deceit </i>under his arm, an anticipatory smirk on
his face, <i>and Simon is finally ejected from the Sheraton-Chicago shouting,
&quot;Faggots! I think you're all a bunch of faggots!&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;And here's one of their jokes,&quot; Simon adds. &quot;Over the
eagle's head, do you dig that Star of David? They put that one in—one single
six-pointed Jewish star, made up of all the five-pointed stars—just so some
right-wing cranks could find it and proclaim it as proof that the Elders of Zion
control the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Overlooking the crowd in UN Plaza, Zev Hirsch, New York State Commander of
God's Lightning, watches his thick-shouldered troops, swinging their wooden
crosses like tomahawks, drive back the lily-livered peaceniks. There is</p>
<p>an obstacle. A blue line of policemen has formed between the men of God's
Lightning and their prey. Over the cops' shoulders, the peaceniks are screeching
dirty words at their plastic-hatted enemies. Zev's eyes scan the crowd. He
catches the eye of a red-faced cop with gold braid on his cap. Zev gives the
Police Captain a questioning look. The Captain winks. A minute later the Captain
makes a small gesture with his left hand. Immediately, the line of police
vanishes, as if melted in the bright spring sun that beats down on the plaza.
The battalion of God's Lightning falls upon their anguished, outraged, and
astonished victims. Zev Hirsch laughs. This is a lot more fun than the old days
in the Jewish Defense League. All the servants are drunk. And the rain
continues.</p>
<p><i>At an outdoor cafe in Jerusalem two white-haired old men wearing black are
drinking coffee together. They try to mask their emotions from the people around
them, but their eyes are wild with excitement. They are staring at an inside
page of a Yiddish newspaper, reading two ads in Yiddish, a large, quarter-page
announcement of the greatest rock festival of all time to be held near
Ingolstadt, Bavaria—bands of all nations, people of all nations, to be known
as Woodstock Europa. On the same page is the paper's personals column, and the
watery eyes of the two old men are re-reading for the fifth time the statement,
in Yiddish, &quot;In thanks to St. Jude for favors granted.—A. W.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>One old man points at the page with a trembling finger. &quot;It is
coming,&quot; he says in German.</i></p>
<p><i>The other one nods, a beatific smile on his withered face. &quot;Jawohl.
It is coming very soon. Der Tag. Soon we must to Bavaria go. Ewige Blumenkraft!&quot;</i></p>
<p>Carlo put the gun on the table between us. &quot;This is it, George,&quot; he
said. &quot;Are you a revolutionary, or are you just on an ego trip playing at
being a revolutionary? Can you take the gun?&quot;</p>
<p><i>I wiped my eyes. The Passaic was flowing below me, a steady stream of
garbage from the Paterson falls down to Newark and the Atlantic Ocean. Like the
garbage that was my contemptible, cowardly soul. . . . </i>The God's Lightning
troopers fan out, clubbing each person wearing an I WON'T DIE FOR FERNANDO POO
button. Blood dances in the air, fragile red bubbles, before the tomblike slab
of the UN building. . . . <i>Dillinger's breathing slows down. He stares at the
ruby eye atop the 13-step pyramid hidden in the UN building, and he thinks of
pentagons.</i></p>
<p>&quot;I'm a God's Lightning,&quot; Carlo said. &quot;This is no joke, baby,
I'm going to do the whole bit.&quot; His intense eyes burned into mine as the
switchblade came out of his pocket. &quot;Motherfuckin' commie,&quot; he
screamed suddenly, leaping up so quickly that the chair fell over behind him.
&quot;You're not getting off with a beating this time. I'm gonna cut your balls
off and take them home as a souvenir.&quot; He slashed forward with the knife,
deflecting his swing at the last minute. &quot;Made you jump, you long-haired
faggotty freak. I wonder if you have any balls to cut off. Well, I'll find
out.&quot; He inched forward, the knife weaving snakelike patterns in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Look,&quot; I said desperately, &quot;I know you're only
playacting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't know <i>nothing, </i>baby. Maybe I'm FBI or CIA. Maybe this
is just an excuse to get you to go for the gun so I can kill you and claim
self-defense. Life isn't all demonstrations and play-acting, George. There comes
a time when it gets serious.&quot; He lunged again with the knife, and I
stumbled clumsily backward. &quot;Are you going to take the gun or am I going to
cut your balls off and tell the Group you're no fucking good and we couldn't use
you?&quot;</p>
<p>He was totally mad and I was totally sane. Is that a more flattering way of
telling it, instead of the truth, that he was brave and I was yellow?</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; I said, &quot;I know you won't really stab me and you
know I won't really shoot you-—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shit on <i>you know </i>and / <i>know,&quot; </i>Carlo hit me in the
chest with his free hand, hard. &quot;I'm a God's Lightning, really a God's
Lightning. I'm gonna do the whole scene. This is a test, but the test is for
real.&quot; He hit me again, jarring my balance, then slapped my face, twice,
rapidly, back and forth like a windshield wiper. &quot;I always said you
longhaired commie freaks don't have no guts. You can't even fight back. You
can't even feel angry, can you? You just feel sorry for yourself, right?&quot;</p>
<p>It was too damned true. A nerve twinged deep down inside at the unfairness of
it, of his ability to see into me more than I usually dared see into myself; and
at last I grabbed the gun from the table, screaming, &quot;You sadistic <i>Stalinist
</i>son-of-a-bitch!&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;And look at the eagle,&quot; Simon says. &quot;Look real close. That
ain't really no olive branch in his left claw, baby.</i></p>
<p><i>That's our old friend Maria Juana. You never really looked at a dollar
bill before, did you?</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;And the real symbolism of the pyramid is alchemical, of course. The
traditional code represents the three kinds of sex by a cube, a pyramid, and a
sphere. The cube is that travesty we call 'normal sex, in which the two nervous
systems never actually merge at the orgasm, like the two parallel sides of the
cube. The pyramid is the two coming together and joining, the magical-telepathic
orgasm. The sphere is the Tantric ritual, endlessly prolonged, with no orgasm at
all. The alchemists used that code for over two thousand years. The Rosicrucians
among the founding fathers used the pyramid as a symbol of their kind of sex
magic. Aleister Crowley used that symbol the same way, more recently. The eye on
the pyramid is the two minds meeting. Neurological interlock. The opening of the
Eye of Shiva. </i>Ewige Schlangekraft—<i>the eternal serpent power. The
joining of the Rose and Cross, vagina and penis, into Rose-Cross. The astral
leap. Mind escaping from physiology.&quot;</i></p>
<p>The AUM was supposed to work almost instantly, according to what the
scientists at ELF had told Hagbard, so Joe approached the first man who had
sampled the punch and started a conversation. &quot;Nice talk Smiling Jim grve,&quot;
he said earnestly. (7 <i>rammed the gun into Carlo's gut and saw him go white
about the lips. &quot;No, don't worry,&quot; I said, smiling. &quot;I'm not
using it on you. But when I come back there'll be a dead pig on the streets
somewhere in Morningside Heights.&quot; He started to speak, and I jabbed
downward with the gun, grinning as he gasped for air. &quot;Comrade,&quot; I
added.) </i>&quot;Yeah, Smiling Jim was born with a silver tongue,&quot; the
other man said.</p>
<p>&quot;A silver tongue,&quot; Joe agreed solemnly, then added, holding out his
hand, &quot;by the way, I'm Jim Mallison from the New York delegation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Knew by your accent,&quot; the other said shrewdly. &quot;I'm Clem
Cotex from down Little Rock.&quot; They shook. &quot;Pleasure to meet you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too bad about that kid that got thrown out,&quot; Joe said, lowering
his voice. &quot;It looked to me like that usher really was—you know—<i>touching
</i>him.&quot;</p>
<p>Cotex looked surprised for a moment, but then shook his head in doubt.
&quot;Can't tell nowadays, especially in big</p>
<p>cities. Do you really think an <i>Andy Frain </i>usher could be
a—fairy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like you said, nowadays in big cities . . .&quot; Joe shrugged.
&quot;I'm just saying that it looked like it to me. Of course, maybe the usher
isn't one. Maybe he's just a cheap thief who was trying to pick the kid's
pocket. A lot of that goes on these days, too.&quot; Cotex involuntarily reached
back to check his own wallet, and Joe went on blandly. &quot;But I wouldn't rule
out the other, not by a long shot. What sort of man would want to be an usher at
a KCUF meeting, if you stop and think about it? You must have observed how many
homosexuals there are in our organization.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Cotex's eyes bulged.</p>
<p>&quot;You haven't noticed it?&quot; Joe smiled loftily. &quot;There are very
few of us who are really Christians. Most of the membership are just a <i>little
bit lavender, </i>know what I mean? I think it's one of our biggest problems,
and we ought to bring it out into the open and discuss it frankly. Clear the
air, right? For instance, take the way Smiling Jim always puts his arm around
your shoulder when he talks to you—&quot;</p>
<p>Cotex interrupted, &quot;Hey, mister, you're pretty darn bright. Just now hit
me like a flash—some of the <i>men </i>here, when Smiling Jim showed those
beaver shots to prove how bad some magazines are getting, they really shuddered.
They didn't just disapprove—it really honest-to-Pete revolted them. What kind
of <i>man </i>actually finds a naked lady disgusting?&quot;</p>
<p>Go, baby, go, Joe thought. The AUM is working. He quickly derailed the
conversation. &quot;Another thing that bothers me. Why don't we ever challenge
the spherical earth theory?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look,&quot; Joe said. &quot;If all the scientists and eggheads and
commies and liberals are pushing it in our schools all the time, there must be
something a little fishy about it. Did you ever stop to think that there's no
way—just no way at all—to reconcile a spherical earth with the story of the
Flood, or Joshua's miracle, or Jesus standing on the pinnacle of the Temple and
seeing all the kingdoms of the earth? And I ask you, man to man, in all your
travels have you ever <i>seen </i>the curvature anywhere? Every place <i>I've </i>been
is flat. Are we going to trust the Bible and the evidence of our own senses, or
are we going to listen to a bunch of agnostics and atheists in laboratory
smocks?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the earth's shadow on the moon during an eclipse . . .&quot;</p>
<p>Joe took a dime out of his pocket and held it up. 'This casts a circular
shadow, but it's flat, not spherical.&quot;</p>
<p>Cotex stared into space for a long moment, while Joe waited with suppressed
excitement. &quot;You know something?&quot; Gotex said finally, &quot;all the
Bible miracles and our own travels and the shadow on the moon would make sense
if the earth was shaped like a <i>carrot </i>and all the continents were on the
flat end—&quot;</p>
<p>Praise be to Simon's god, Bugs Bunny, Joe thought elatedly. It's
happening—he's not only gullible—he's creative.</p>
<p><i>I followed the cop—the pig, I corrected myself—out of the cafeteria. I
was so keyed up that it was a Trip. The blue of his uniform, the neon signs,
even the green of the lampposts, all were coming in superbright. That was
adrenalin. My mouth was dry—dehydration. All the classic flight-fight
symptoms. The activation syndrome, Skinner calls it. I let the cop—the
pig—get half a block ahead and reached in my pocket for the revolver.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Come on, George!&quot; Malik shouted. George didn't want to move. His
heart was thumping, his arms and legs trembling so hard he knew they'd be
useless to him in a fight. But he just didn't want to move. He'd had enough of
running from these motherfuckers.</p>
<p>But he couldn't help himself. As the men in blue shirts and white helmets
came on, the crowd surged away from them, and George had to move back with the
crowd or be knocked down and trampled.</p>
<p>&quot;Come <i>on, </i>George.&quot; It was Pete Jackson at his side now, with
a good, hard grip on his arm, tugging him.</p>
<p>&quot;Goddam it, why do we have to run away from them?&quot; George said,
stumbling backward.</p>
<p>Peter was smiling faintly. &quot;Don't you read your Mao, George? Enemy
attacks, we retreat. Let the Morituri fanatics stand and get creamed.&quot;</p>
<p>/ <i>couldn't do it. My hand held the gun, but I couldn't take it out and
hold it in front of me any more than I could take out my penis and wave it
around. I was sure, even though the street was empty except for me and the pig,
that a dozen people would jump out of doorways yelling, &quot;Look, he took it
out of his pants.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Just like right now, when Hagbard said, &quot;Button up your asshole. We're
in for a fight,&quot; I stood frozen like I stood frozen on the embankment above
the Passaic.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Are you on an ego trip playing at being a revolutionary?&quot; Carlo
asked.</i></p>
<p>And Mavis: &quot;All the militant radicals in your crowd ever do is take out
the Molotov cocktail diagram that they carefully clipped from <i>The New York
Review of Books, </i>hang it on the bathroom door, and jack-off in connection
with it.&quot;</p>
<p>Howard sang:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foe is attacking, their ships coming near, Now is the time to fight
without fear! Now is the time to look death in the eye Before we submit, we'll
fight till we die!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>This time I got the gun out of my pocket—standing there, looking down at
the Passaic—and raised it to my forehead. If I didn't have the courage for
homicide, Jesus knows I have despair enough for a hundred suicides. And I only
have to do it once. Just once, and then oblivion. I cock the firing pin. (More
play-acting, George? Or will you really do it?) I'll do it, damn you, damn all
of you. I pull the trigger and fall, with the explosion, into blackness.</i></p>
<p>(AUM was a product of the scientists at ELF—the Erisian Liberation
Front—and shared by them with the JAMs. An extract of hemp, boosted with RNA,
the &quot;learning&quot; molecule, it also had small traces of the famous
&quot;Frisco Speedball&quot;—heroin, cocaine, and LSD. The effect seemed to be
that the heroin stilled anxiety, the RNA stimulated creativity, the hemp and
acid opened the mind to joy, and the cocaine was there to fit the Law of Fives.
The delicate balance created no hallucinations, no sense of
&quot;high&quot;—just a sudden spurt in what Hagbard Celine liked to call
&quot;constructive gullibility.&quot;)</p>
<p><i>It was one of those sudden shifts of movement that occur in a mob scene.
Instead of pushing George and Peter back, the crowd between them and the white
helmets were parting. A slender man fell heavily against George, anguish in his
eyes. There was a terrible thump, and the man fell to the ground.</i></p>
<p><i>George saw the dark brown wooden cross before he saw the man who wielded
it. There was blood and hair at the end of the crossarm. The God's Lightning man
was dark, broad and muscular, with a blue shadow on his cheeks. He looked
Italian or Spanish—he looked, in fact, a lot like Carlo. His eyes were wide
and his mouth was open and he was breathing heavily. The expression was neither
rage nor sadistic joy—just the unthinking panting alertness of a man doing a
difficult and fatiguing job. He bent over the fallen slender man and raised the
cross.</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;All right!&quot; snapped Peter Jackson. He pushed George aside.
There was a silly-looking yellow plastic water pistol in his hand. He squirted
the oblivious God's Lightning man in the back of the neck. The man screamed,
arched backward, the cross flying end over end into the air. He fell on his back
and lay screaming and writhing.</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Come on now, motherfucker!&quot; Pete snarled as he dragged George
into the crowd, broken-field running toward Forty-second Street.</i></p>
<p>&quot;An hour and a half to go,&quot; Hagbard says, finally beginning to show
suppressed tension. George checks his watch—it's exactly 10:30 P.M.,
Ingolstadt time. The Plastic Canoe is wailing KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE.</p>
<p>( <i>Under the noon sun, two days earlier, Carmel speeds in his jeep away
from Las Vegas.)</i></p>
<p>&quot;Who am I going to meet at the Norton Cabal?&quot;&quot; Joe asks.
&quot;Judge Crater? Amelia Earhart? Nothing would surprise me now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A few real together people,&quot; Simon replies. &quot;But no one like
that. But you'll have to die, really die, man, before you're illuminated.&quot;
He smiles gently. &quot;Aside from death and resurrection, you won't find
anything you'd call 'supernatural' with this bunch. Not even a whiff of old
Chicago-style Satanism.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God,&quot; Joe says, &quot;was that only a week ago?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep,&quot; Simon grins, gunning his VW around a Chevrolet with Oregon
license plates, &quot;It's still nineteen sixty-nine, even if you seem to have
lived several years since we met at the anarchist caucus.&quot; His eyes are
amused as he half turns to glance at Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose that means you know what's been happening in my dreams. I'm
getting the flashforwards already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Always happens after a good dirty Black Mass with pot mixed in the
incense,&quot; Simon says. &quot;What sort of thing you getting? Is it happening
when you're awake yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, only in my dreams.&quot; Joe pauses, thinking. &quot;I only know
it's the real article because the dreams are so vivid. One set has to do with
some kind of pro-censorship rally at the Sheraton-Chicago hotel, I think about a
year from now. There's another set that seems farther in the future—five or
six years—where I'm impersonating a doctor for some reason. And a third group
of images comes to me, now and then, that seems to be the set of a Frankenstein
movie, except that the extras are all hippies and there seems to be a rock
festival going on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does it bother you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A little. I'm used to waking up in the morning with the future ahead of
me, not behind me <i>and </i>ahead of me <i>both.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;You'll get used to it. You're just beginning to contact what old
Weishaupt called <i>'die Morgensheutegesternwelf —</i>the
tomorrow-today-yesterday world. It gave Goethe the idea for <i>Faust, </i>just
like Weishaupt's <i>'Ewige Blumenkraft' </i>slogan inspired Goethe's <i>'Ewige
Weibliche.' </i>I'll tell you what,&quot; Simon suggested, &quot;You might try
wearing three wristwatches, like Bucky Fuller does—one showing the time where
you're at, one showing the tune where you're going, and one showing the time at
some arbitrary place like Greenwich Mean Time or your home town. It'll help you
get used to relativity. Meanwhile, never whistle while you're pissing. And you
might repeat to yourself, when you get disoriented, Fuller's sentence, 'I seem
to be a verb.'&quot;</p>
<p>They drove in silence for a while, and Joe pondered on being a verb. Hell, he
thought, I have enough trouble understanding what Fuller means when he says <i>God
</i>is a verb. Simon let him mull it over, and began humming again: &quot;Rameses
the Second is dead, my love/He's walking the fields where the BLESSED liiiiive.
. . .&quot; Joe realized he was starting to doze . . . <i>and all the faces at
the luncheon table looked at him in astonishment. &quot;No, seriously,&quot; he
said. &quot;Anthropologists are too timid to say it out in the open, in public,
but corner one of them in private and ask him.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>Every detail was clear: it was the same room in the Sheraton-Chicago
Hotel, and the faces were the same. (I've been here before and said this
before.)</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;The rain dances of the Indians work. The rain always comes. So why
isn't it possible that their gods are real and ours isn't? Have you ever prayed
to Jesus for something and really gotten it?&quot; There is a long silence and
finally an old tight-faced woman smiles youthfully and declares, &quot;Young
man, I'm going to try it. How do 1 meet an Indian in Chicago?&quot;</i></p>
<p>Like tomahawks the crosses of God's Lightning rose and fell on the slender
man's defenseless skull. They'd found their injured comrade lying on the street
twisting and moaning beside his erstwhile victim. A couple of them hauled the
wounded God's Lightning man away, while the rest took their revenge on the
unconscious peace demonstrator.</p>
<p>(&quot;You, Luke,&quot; says Yeshua ben Yosef, &quot;don't write that

<p>Space-time, then, may be slanted or kiltered when you're lost out here:
Fernando Poo looks through his glass at a new island, not guessing that it will
be named after himself, not imagining that someday Simon Moon will write
&quot;In Fourteen Hundred and Seventy Two, Fernando Poo discovered Fernando Poo,&quot;
and Hagbard says, &quot;Truth is a tiger,&quot; while Timothy Leary does a Crown
Point Pavanne out of San Luis Obispo Jail and four billion years earlier one
squink says to another, &quot;I've solved the ecology problem on this new
planet.&quot; The other squink, partner to the first (they own Swift Kick Inc.,
the shoddiest contractors in the Milky Way) says &quot;How?&quot; The first
squink laughs coarsely. &quot;Every organism produced will be programmed with a
Death Trip. It'll give them a rather gloomy outlook, I admit, especially the
more conscious ones, but it will sure minimize costs for us.&quot; Swift Kick
Inc. cut the edges every other way they could think, and Earth emerged as the
Horrible Example invoked in all classes on planetary design throughout the
galaxy.</p>

<p>When Burroughs told me that, I flipped, because I was 23 that year and lived
on Clark Street. Besides, I immediately saw the application to the Law of Fives:
2 + 3 = 5 and Clark has 5 letters.</p>
<p>I was mulling this over when I happened to notice the shipwreck in Pound's
Canto 23. That's the only shipwreck mentioned in the whole 800-page poem, in
spite of all the nautical voyages described. Canto 23 also contains the line,
&quot;with the sun in a golden cup,&quot; which Yeats says inspired his own
lines, &quot;the golden apples of the sun, the silver apples of the moon.&quot;</p>
<p>Golden apples, of course, brought me back to Eris, and I realized I was onto
something hot.</p>
<p>Then I tried adding the Illuminati Five to 23, and I got 28. The average
menstrual period of Woman. The lunar cycle. Back to the silver apples of the
moon— and I'm Moon. Of course, Pound and Yeats both have five letters in their
names.</p>
<p>If this be schizophrenia, I said with a P. Henry twist (one better than an O.

<p>Through a bullhorn, a police captain began to shout,</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">CLEAR
THE PLAZA CLEAR THE PLAZA.</span></b></p>
<p>The first reports of the annihilation camps were passed on to the OSS by a
Swiss businessman evaluated as being one of the most trustworthy informants on
affairs in Nazi Europe. The State Department decided that the stories were not
confirmed. That was early in 1943. By autumn of that year, more urgent reports
from the same source transmitted still through the OSS forced a major policy
conference. It was again decided that the reports were not true. As winter
began, the English government asked for another conference to discuss similar
reports from their own intelligence networks and from the government of Rumania.
The delegates met in Bermuda for a warm, sunny weekend, and decided that the
reports were not true; they returned to their work refreshed and tanned. The
death trains continued to roll. Early in 1944, Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Secretary
of the Treasury, was reached by dissenters in the State Department, examined the
evidence, and forced a meeting with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Shaken
by the assertions in Morgenthau's documents, Roosevelt pledged that he would act
at once. He never did. It was said later that the State Department convinced
him, once again, of their own analysis: the reports simply were not true. When
Mr. Hitler said <i>Ver-nichtung </i>he had not really meant <i>Vemichtung. </i>An
author, Ben Hecht, then placed an ad in the <i>New York Times, </i>presenting
the evidence to the public; a group of prominent rabbis attacked him for
alarming Jews unnecessarily and undermining confidence in America's Chief
Executive during wartime. Finally, late that year, American and Russian troops
began liberating the camps, and General Eisen-</p>
<p>bower insisted that news photographers take detailed movies which were
released to the whole world. In the interval between the first suppressed report
by the Swiss businessman and the liberation of the first camp, six million
people had died.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what we call a Bavarian Fire Drill,&quot; Simon explained to
Joe. (It was another time; he was driving another Volkswagen. In fact, it was
the night of April 23 and they were going to meet Tobias Knight at the UN
building.) &quot;It was one official named Winifred who'd been transferred from
the Justice Department to a key State Department desk where every bit of
evidence passed for evaluation. But the same principles apply everywhere. For
instance—we're half an hour early for the meeting anyhow—I'll give you an
illustration right now.&quot; They were approaching the corner of Forty-third
Street and Third Avenue and Simon had observed that the streetlight was changing
to red. As he stopped the car, he opened the door and said to Joe, &quot;Follow
me.&quot;</p>
<p>Puzzled, Joe got out as Simon ran to the car behind them, beat on the hood
with his hand and shouted &quot;Bavarian Fire Drill! Out!&quot; He made vigorous
but ambiguous motions with his hands and ran to the car next back. Joe saw the
first subject look dubiously at his companion and then open the door and get
out, obediently trailing behind Simon's urgent and somber figure.</p>
<p>&quot;Bavarian Fire Drill! Out!&quot; Simon was already shouting at the third
car back.</p>
<p>As Joe trotted along, occasionally adding his own voice to persuade the more
dubious drivers, every car gradually emptied and people formed a neat line
heading back toward Lexington Avenue. Simon then ducked between two cars and
began jogging toward the front of the -line at Third Avenue again, shouting to
everybody, &quot;Complete circle! Stay in line!&quot; Obediently, everyone
followed in a great circle back to their own cars, reentering from the side
opposite to that from which they had left. Simon and Joe climbed back into the
VW, the light changed, and they sped ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;You see?&quot; Simon asked. &quot;Use words they've been conditioned to
since childhood—'fire drill,' 'stay in line,' like that—and never look back
to see if they're obeying. They'll follow. Well, that's the way the Illuminati
guaranteed that the Final Solution wouldn't be interrupted. Winifred, one guy
who had been around long enough to have an impressive title, and his scrawl
'Evaluation: dubious' on the bottom of each memo . . . and six million died.
Hilarious, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>And Joe remembered from the little book by Hagbard Celine, <i>Never Whistle
While You're Pissing </i>(privately printed, and distributed only to members of
the JAMs and the Legion of Dynamic Discord): &quot;The individual act of
obedience is the cornerstone not only of the strength of authoritarian society
but also of its weakness.&quot;</p>
<p>(On November 23, 1970, the body of Stanislaus Oedipuski, forty-six, of West
living Park Road, was found floating in the Chicago river. Death, according to
the police laboratory, did not result from drowning but from beating about the
head and shoulders with a square-ended object. The first inquiries by homicide
detectives revealed that Oedipuski had been a member of God's Lightning and the
theory was formed that a conflict between the dead man and his former colleagues
might have resulted in his being snuffed with their Wooden crosses. Further
investigation revealed that Oedipuski had been a construction worker and until
very recently well liked on his job, behaving in a normal, down-to-earth manner,
bitching about the government, cursing the lazy bums on Welfare, hating niggers,
shouting obscene remarks at good-looking dolls who passed construction sites
and—when the odds were safely above the 8-to-l level—joining other
middle-aged workers in attacking and beating young men with long hair, peace
buttons, or other un-American stigmata. Then, about a month before, all that had
changed. He began bitching about the bosses as well as the government—almost
sounding like a communist at times; when somebody else cussed the crumb-bums on
Welfare, Stan remarked thoughtfully, &quot;Well, you know, our union keeps them
from getting jobs, fellows, so what else can they do but go on Welfare?
Steal?&quot; He even said once, when some of the guys were good-humoredly giving
the finger and making other gallant noises and signals toward a passing
eighteen-year-old girl, &quot;Hey, you know, that might really be embarrassing
and scaring her . . . !&quot; Worse yet, his own hair begun to grow surprisingly
long in the back, and his wife told friends that he didn't look at TV much
anymore but instead sat in a chair most evenings reading <i>books. </i>The
police found that was indeed true, and his small library—gathered in less</p>
<p>than a month—was remarkable indeed, featuring works on astronomy,
sociology, Oriental mysticism, Darwin's <i>Origin of the Species, </i>detective
novels by Raymond Chandler, <i>Alice in Wonderland, </i>and a college-level text
on number theory with the section on primes heavily marked with notes in the
margin; the gallant, and now pathetic, tracks of a mind that was beginning to
grow after four decades of stagnation, and then had been abruptly stomped. Most
mysterious of all was the card found in the dead man's pocket, which although
waterlogged, could still be read. One side said</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THERE IS NO ENEMY ANYWHERE</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the other side, even more mysteriously, was inscribed:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1028"
 type="#_x0000_t75" alt="illum-part2-7.jpg" style='width:197.25pt;height:37.5pt'>
 <v:imagedata src="1.htm7.jpg"

<img src="1.htm7.jpg" alt="illum-part2-7.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028" width="263" height="50"></span></p>
<p>The police might have tried to decipher this, but then they discovered that
Oedipuski had resigned from God's Lightning—giving his fellow members a
lecture on tolerance in the process—the night before his death. That closed
the case, definitely. Homicide did not investigate murders clearly connected
with God's Lightning, since the Red Squad had its own personal accommodation
with that burgeoning organization. &quot;Poor motherfucker,&quot; a detective
said, looking at Oedipuski's photographs; and closed the file forever. Nobody
ever reopened it, or traced the change in the dead man back to his attendance at
the meeting, one month before, of KCUF at the Sheraton-Chicago, where the punch
was spiked with AUM.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the act of conception, of course, the father contributes 23 chromosomes
and the mother contributes another 23. In the / <i>Ching, </i>hexagram 23 has
connotations of &quot;sinking&quot; or &quot;breaking apart,&quot; shades of the
unfortunate Captain Clarks. . . .</p>
<p>Another woman just came by, collecting for the Mothers March against Muscular
Dystrophy. I gave her a quarter. Where was I? Oh, yes: James Joyce had five
letters in both his front name and his hind name, so he was worth looking into. <i>A
Portrait of the Artist </i>has five chapters, all well and good, but <i>Ulysses </i>has
18 chapters, a stumper, until I remembered that 5 + 18 = 23. How about <i>Finnegans
Wake? </i>Alas, that has 17 chapters, and I was bogged down for a while.</p>
<p>Trying another angle, I wondered if Frank Sullivan, the poor cluck who got
shot instead of John at the Biograph Theatre that night, could have lingered
until after midnight, dying on July 23 instead of July</p>
<p>22 as usually stated. I looked it up in Toland's book, <i>The Dillinger Days.
</i>Poor Frank, sad to say, died before midnight, but Toland included an
interesting detail, which I told you that night at the Seminary bar:</p>
<p>23 people died of heat prostration that day in Chicago. He added something
else: 17 people had died of heat prostration the day before. Why did he mention
that? I'm sure he doesn't know—but there it was again, 23 and 17. Maybe
something important is going to happen in the year 2317? I couldn't check that,
of course (you can't navigate precisely in the <i>Morgensheutegesternwelt), </i>so
I went back to 1723, and struck golden apples. That was the year Adam Smith and
Adam Weishaupt were both born (and Smith published <i>The Wealth of Nations </i>the
same year Weishaupt revived the Illluminati: 1776.)</p>
<p>Well, 2 + 3 = 5, fitting the Law of Fives, but 1+7 = 8, fitting nothing.
Where did that leave me? Eight, I reflected, is the number of letters in
Kallisti, back to the golden apple again, and 8 is also 2<sup>3</sup>, hot damn.
Naturally, it came as no surprise when the 8 defendants in the Chicago
Conspiracy Trial, which grew out of our little Convention Week Carnival, were
tried on the 23rd floor of the Federal Building, amid a flurry of
synchronicity—a Hoffman among the defendants, a Hoffman as judge; the
Uluminati pyramid, or Great Seal of the U.S. right inside the door of the
building, and a Scale getting worse abuse than the other defendants; five-letter
names and proliferating—Abbie, Davis, Foran, Scale, Jerry Rubin (twice), and
the clincher, Clark (Ramsey, not Captain) who was torpedoed and sunk by the
judge before he could testify.</p>
<p>I got interested in Dutch Shultz because he died on October 23. A cluster of
synchronicity, that man: he ordered the shooting of Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot;
Coll (remember Mad Dog, Texas); Coll was shot on 23rd Street, when he was 23
years old; and Charlie Workman, who allegedly shot Schultz, served 23 years in
prison for it (although rumor has it that Mendy Weiss—two five-letter names,
again—did the real shooting.) Does 17 come in? You bet Shultz was first
sentenced to prison at the age of 17.</p>
<p>Around this time I bought Robert Heinlein's <i>The Puppet Masters, </i>thinking
the plot might parallel some Illuminati operations. Imagine how I felt when
Chapter Two began, &quot;23 hours and 17 minutes ago, a flying saucer landed in
Iowa . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, in New York, Peter Jackson is trying to get the next issue of <i>Confrontation
</i>out on time—although the office is still a shambles, the editor and star
researcher have disappeared, the best reporter has gone ape and claims to be at
the bottom of the Atlantic with a wax tycoon, and the police are hounding Peter
to find out why the first two detectives assigned to the case can't be located.
Sitting in his apartment (now the magazine's office) in his shut and shorts,
Peter dials his phone with one hand, adding another crushed cigarette to the
pile in the ashtray with the other. Throwing a manuscript onto a basket marked
&quot;Ready for Printer,&quot; he crosses off &quot;lead article—The Youngest
Student Ever Admitted to Columbia Tells Why He Dropped Out by L. L. Durrutti&quot;
from a list on the pad before him. His pencil moves down to the bottom,
&quot;Book Review,&quot; as he listens to the phone ring. Finally, he hears the
click of a lifted receiver and a rich, flutey voice says, &quot;Epicene
Wildeblood here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Got your book review ready, Eppy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have it tomorrow, dear boy. Can't be any faster, <i>honestly!&quot;</i></p>
<p>'Tomorrow will do,&quot; Peter says writing <i>call again—</i>A.M. next to
&quot;Book Review.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a dreadfully long monster of a book,&quot; Wildeblood says
pettishly, &quot;and I certainly won't have time to read it, but I'm giving it a
thorough <i>skimming. </i>The authors are utterly incompetent—no sense of
style or structure at all. It starts out as a detective story, switches to
science-fiction, then goes off into the supernatural, and is full of the most
detailed information of dozens of <i>ghastly </i>boring subjects. And the time
sequence is all out of order in a very pretentious imitation of Faulkner and
Joyce. Worst yet, it has the most raunchy sex scenes, thrown in just to make it
sell,</p>
<p>I'm sure, and the authors—whom I've <i>never </i>heard of— have the
supreme bad taste to introduce real political figures into this mishmash and
pretend to be exposing a real conspiracy. You can be <i>sure </i>I won't waste
time reading such rubbish, but I'll have a perfectly devastating review ready
for you by tomorrow noon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we don't expect you to read every book you review,&quot; Peter
says mollifyingly, &quot;just so long as you can be entertaining about
them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Foot Fetishist Liberation Front will be participating in the rally
at the UN building,&quot; Joe Malik said, as George and Peter and he were
affixing their black armbands.</p>
<p>&quot;Christ,&quot; Jackson said disgustedly.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't afford to take that attitude,&quot; Joe said severely.
&quot;The only hope for the Left at this time is coalition politics. We can't
exclude anybody who wants to join us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've got nothing against faggots personally,&quot; Peter begins
(&quot;Gays,&quot; Joe says patiently). &quot;I've got nothing against Gays
personally,&quot; Peter goes on, &quot;but they are a bringdown at rallies. They
just give God's Lightning more evidence to say we're all a bunch of fruits. But,
OK, realism is realism, there are a lot of them, and they swell our ranks, and
all that, but, Jesus, Joe. These <i>toe freaks </i>are a splinter within a
splinter. They're microscopic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't call them toe freaks,&quot; Joe says. &quot;They don't like
that.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A woman from the Mothers March Against Psoriasis just came by with another
collection box. I gave her a quarter, too. The marching mothers are going to
strip Moon of his bread if this keeps up.</p>
<p>Where was I? I meant to add, in relation to the Dutch Shultz shooting that
Marty Krompier, who ran the policy racket in Harlem, was also shot on October
23, 1935. The police asked him if there was a connection with phlegmatic
Flegenheimer's demise and he said, &quot;It's got to be one of them
coincidences.&quot; I wonder how he emphasized that—&quot;one of them <i>coincidences&quot;
</i>or &quot;one of <i>them </i>coincidences&quot;? How much did he know?</p>
<p>That brings me to the 40 enigma. As pointed out, 1 + 7 = 8, the number of
letters in Kallisti. 8 x 5 = 40.</p>
<p>More interestingly, without invoking the mystic 5, we still arrive at 40 by
adding 17 + 23. What, then, is the significance of 40? I've run through various
associations—Jesus had his 40 days in the desert, Ali Baba had his 40 thieves,
Buddhists have their 40 meditations, the solar system is almost exactly 40
astronomical units in radius (Pluto yo-yos a bit)—but I have no definite
theory yet . . .</p>
<p>The color television set in the Three Lions Pub in the Tudor Hotel at
Forty-second Street and Second Avenue shows the white-helmeted men carrying
wooden crosses fall back as the blue-helmeted men carrying billy clubs move
forward. The CBS camera pans over the plaza. There are five bodies on the ground
scattered like flotsam tossed on a beach by a receding wave. Four of them are
moving, making slow efforts to get up. The fifth is not moving at all.</p>
<p>George said, &quot;I think that's the guy we saw getting clubbed. My God, I
hope he isn't dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe Malik said, &quot;If he is dead, it may get people to demand that
something be done about God's Lightning.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter Jackson laughed mirthlessly. &quot;You still think some honky peacenik
getting killed is going to make people indignant. Don't you understand, nobody
in this country <i>cares </i>what happens to a peace freak. You're in the same
boat with the niggers now, you silly sons-of-bitches.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Carlos looked up in astonishment as I burst into the room, still wet from
the Passaic, and threw the gun at his feet, screaming, &quot;You silly
sons-of-bitches, you can't even make bombs without blowing yourselves up, and
when you buy a gun the motherfucker is defective and misfires. You can't expel
me—I quit!&quot; You silly sons-of-bitches.:..</i></p>
<p>&quot;You silly sons-of-bitches!&quot; Simon shouted. Joe woke as the VW
swerved amid a flurry of Hell's Angels bike roaring by. He was back in
&quot;real&quot; time again—but the word had quotes around it, in his mind,
now, and it always would.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow,&quot; he said, &quot;I was in Chicago again, and then at that rock
festival . . . and then I was in somebody else's lifeline. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goddam Harley-Davidsons,&quot; Simon mutters as the last Angel thunders
by. &quot;When fifty or sixty of them swarm by like that, it's as bad as trying
to drive on the sidewalk in</p>
<p>Times Square at high noon without hitting a pedestrian.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Later-for-that,&quot; Joe said, conscious of his growing ease in using
Simon's own language. &quot;This tomorrow-today-yesterday time is beginning to
get under my skin. It's happening more and more often. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>Simon sighed, &quot;You want words to put around it. You can't accept it
until it has labels dangling off it, like a new suit. OK. And your favorite
word-game is science. Fine, right on! Tomorrow we'll drop by the Main Library
and you can look up the English science journal <i>Nature </i>for Summer
nineteen sixty-six. There's an article in there by the University College
physicist F. R. Stannard about what he calls the Faustian Universe. He tells how
the behavior of <i>K</i>-mesons can't be explained assuming a one-way
time-track, but fits into a neat pattern if you assume our universe overlaps
another where time runs in the opposite direction. He calls it the Faustian
universe, but I'll bet he has no idea that Goethe wrote <i>Faust </i>after
experiencing that universe directly, just as you're doing lately. Incidentally,
Stannard points out that everything in physics is symmetrical, except our
present concept of one-way time. Once you admit two-way time traffic, you've got
a completely symmetrical universe. Fits the Occamite's demand for simplicity.
Stannard'll give you lots of <i>words, </i>man. Meanwhile, just settle for what
Abdul Alhazred wrote in the <i>Necronomicon: </i>'Past, present, future: all are
one in Yog-Sothoth.' Or what Weishaupt wrote in his <i>Konigen, Kirchen und
Dummheit: </i>'There is but one Eye and it is all eyes; one Mind and it is all
minds; one time and it is Now.' Grok?&quot; Joe nods dubiously, faintly hearing
the music:</p>

<p><i>Two big rhinoceroses, three big rhinoceroses ..</i>.</p>
<p>Dillinger made contact with the mind of Richard Belz, forty-three-year-old
professor of physics at Queens College, as Belz was being loaded into an
ambulance to be taken to Bellevue Hospital where X rays would reveal severe
skull fractures. Shit, Dillinger thought, why does somebody have to be half dead
before I can reach him? Then he concentrated on his message: Two universes
flowing in opposite directions. Two together form a third entity which is
synergetically more than the sum of its two parts. Thus two always leads to
three. Two and Three. Duality and trinity. Every unity is a duality and a
trinity. A pentagon. Sheer energy, no matter involved. From the pentagon depend
five more pentagons, like the petals of a flower. A white rose. Five petals and
a center: six. Two times three. The flower interlocks with another flower just
like it, forming a polyhedron made of pentagons. Each such polyhedron could have
common surfaces with other polyhedrons, forming infinite latticeworks based on
the pentagonal unit. They would be immortal. Self-sustaining. Not computers.
Beyond computers. Gods. All space for their habitation. Infinitely complex.</p>
<p>The howl of a siren reached the unconscious ears of Professor Belz.
Consciousness is present in the living body, even in one that is apparently
unconscious. Unconsciousness is not the absence of consciousness, but its
temporary immobility. It is not a state resembling death. It is not like death
at all. Once the necessary complexity of brain-cell interconnections is reached,
substantial energy relationships are set up. These can exist independently of
the material base that brought them into being.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, is merely visual structural metaphor for interactions
on the energy level that cannot be visualized. The siren howled.</p>
<p><i>In the Three Lions pub, George said to Peter, &quot;What was in that water
pistol?&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Sulphuric acid.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Acid is just the first stage,&quot; said Simon. &quot;Like matter is
the first stage of life and consciousness. Acid launches you. But once you're
out there, if the mission is successful, you jettison the first stage and you're
traveling free of gravity. Which means free of matter. Acid dissolves the
barriers which prevent the maximum possible complexity of energy relationships
from building up in the brain. At Norton Cabal, we'll show you how to pilot the
second stage.&quot;</p>
<p><i>(Waving their crosses over their heads and howling incoherently, the men
of God's Lightning formed wavering ranks and marched around the territory they
had conquered. Zev Hirsch and Frank Ochuk carried the banner that read </i>&quot;LOVE
IT OR WE'LL STOMP YOU.&quot;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Howard sang:</p>
<p>The tribes of the porpoise are fearless and strong Our land is the ocean, our
banner's a song Our weapon is speed and our noses like rock No foe can withstand
our terrible shock.</p>
<p>A cloud of porpoise bodies swam out from somewhere behind Hagbard's
submarine. Through the pale blue-green medium which Hagbard's TV cameras made
out of water, they seemed to fly toward the distant spiderlike ships of the
Illuminati.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happening?&quot; said George. &quot;Where's Howard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Howard is leading them,&quot; said Hagbard. He flipped a toggle on the
railing of the balcony on which they stood in the center of a globe that looked
like a bubble of air at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. &quot;War room, get
missiles ready. We may have to back up the porpoise attack.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Da, tovarish Celine,&quot; </i>came a voice.</p>
<p>The porpoises were too far away to be seen now. George discovered that he was
not afraid. The whole thing was too much like watching a science-fiction movie.
There was too much illusion involved in this submarine of Hagbard's. If he were
able to realize, in his glands and nerves, that he was in a vulnerable metal
ship thousands of feet below the surface of the Atlantic, under such enormous
pressure that the slightest stress could crack the hull and send water bursting
in that would crush them to death, then he might be afraid. If he were really
able to accept the fact that those little distant globes with waving legs
appended to them were undersea craft manned by people who intended to destroy
the vessel he was in, then he could be afraid. Actually, if he could not see as
much as he was seeing, but only feel and sense things and be told what was
happening, as in the average airplane flight, then he would be afraid. As it
was, the 120,000-year-old city of Peos looked like a tabletop model. And though
he might intellectually accept Hagbard's statement that they were over the lost
continent of Atlantis, in his bones he didn't believe in Atlantis. As a result,
he didn't believe in any of the rest of this, either.</p>
<p>Suddenly Howard was outside their bubble. Or some other porpoise. That was
another thing that made this hard to accept. Talking porpoises.</p>
<p>&quot;Ready for destruction of enemy ships,&quot; said Howard.</p>
<p>Hagbard shook his head. &quot;I wish we could communicate with them. I wish I
could give them a chance to surrender. But they wouldn't listen. And they have
communications systems on their ships that I can't get through to.&quot; He
turned to George. &quot;They use a type of insulated telepathy to communicate.
The very thing that tipped off Sheriff Jim</p>
<p>Cartwright that you were in a hotel room in Mad Dog smoking Weishaupt's
Wonder Weed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't want them too close when they go.&quot; said Howard.</p>
<p>&quot;Are your people out of the way?&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p><i>(Five big rhinoceroses, six big rhinoceroses.</i>..<i>.)</i></p>
<p>&quot;Of course. Quit this hesitating. This is no time to be a
humanitarian.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The sea is crueler than the land,&quot; said Hagbard,
&quot;sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The sea is cleaner than the land,&quot; said Howard. &quot;There's no
hate. Just death when and as needed. These people have been your enemies for
twenty thousand years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not that old,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;and I have very few
enemies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you wait any longer you'll endanger the submarine and my
people.&quot;</p>
<p>George looked out at the red and white striped globes which were moving
toward them through the blue-green water. They were much larger now and closer.
Whatever was propelling them wasn't visible. Hagbard reached out a brown finger,
let it rest on a white button on the railing in front of him, then pressed it
decisively.</p>
<p>There was a bright flash of light, dimmed slightly by the medium through
which it traveled, on the surface of each of the globes. It was like watching
fireworks through tinted glasses. Next, the globes crumbled as if they were
ping-pong balls being struck by invisible sledge hammers.</p>
<p>'That's all there is to it,&quot; said Hagbard quietly.</p>
<p>The air around George seemed to vibrate, and the floor under him shook.
Suddenly he was terrified. Feeling the shock wave from the simultaneous
explosions out there in the water made it real. A relatively thin metal shell
was all that protected him from total annihilation. And nobody would ever hear
from him or know what happened to him.</p>
<p>Large, glittering objects drifted down through the water from one of the
nearby Illuminati spider ships. They vanished among the streets of the city that
George now knew was real. The buildings in the area near the explosion of the
Illuminati ships looked more ruined than they had before. The ocean bottom was
churned up in brown clouds. Down into the brown clouds drifted the crushed
spider</p>
<p>ships. George looked for the Temple of Tethys. It stood, intact, in the
distance.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you see those statues fall out of the lead ship?&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;I'm claiming them.&quot; He hit the switch on the railing. &quot;Prepare
for salvage operation.&quot;</p>
<p>They dropped down among buildings deeply buried in sediment, and at the
bottom of their television globe George saw two huge claws reach out, seemingly
from nowhere—actually he guessed, from the underside of the submarine—and
pick up four gleaming gold statues that lay half-buried in the mud.</p>
<p>Suddenly a bell rang and a red flash lit up the interior of the bubble.
&quot;We're under attack again,&quot; said Hagbard. Oh, no, George thought. Not
when I'm starting to believe that all this is real. I won't be able to stand it.
Here goes Dorn doing his world-famous coward act again. . . . Hagbard pointed. A
white globe hovered like an underwater moon above a distant range of mountains.
On its pale surface a red emblem was painted, a glaring eye inside a triangle.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me missile visibility,&quot; said Hagbard, flicking a switch.
Between the white globe and the <i>Lief Erickson </i>four orange lights appeared
in the water rushing toward them.</p>
<p>&quot;It just doesn't pay to underestimate them—ever,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;First it turns out they can detect me when they shouldn't have equipment
good enough to do that, now I find that not only do they have small craft in the
vicinity, they've got the <i>Zwack </i>herself coming after me. And the <i>Zwack
</i>is firing underwater missiles at me, though I'm supposed to be indetectable.
I think we might be in trouble, George.&quot;</p>
<p>George wanted to close his eyes, but he also didn't want to show fear in
front of Hagbard. He wondered what death at the bottom of the Atlantic would
feel like. Probably something like being under a pile driver. The water would
hit them, engulf them, and it wouldn't be like any ordinary water—it would be
like liquid steel, every drop striking with the force of a ten-ton truck, prying
cell apart from cell and crushing each cell individually, reducing the body to a
protoplasmic dishrag. He remembered reading about the disappearance of an atomic
submarine called the <i>Thresher </i>back in the '60s, and he recalled that the <i>NewYork
Times </i>had speculated that death by drowning in water under extreme pressure
would be exceedingly painful, though brief. Every nerve individually being
crushed. The spinal cord crushed everywhere along its length. The brain squeezed
to death, bursting, rupturing, bleeding into the steel-hard water. The human
form would doubtless be unrecognizable in minutes. George thought of every bug
he had ever stepped on, and bugs made him think of the spider ships. That's what
we did to <i>them. </i>And I define them as enemies only on Hagbard's say so.
Carlo was right. I can't kill.</p>
<p>Hagbard hesitated, didn't he? Yes, but he did it. Any man who can cause a
death like that to be visited upon other men is a monster. No, not a monster,
only too human. But not my kind of human. Shit, George, he's your kind of human,
all right. You're just a coward. Cowardice doth make consciences for us all.</p>
<p>Hagbard called out, &quot;Howard, where the hell are you?&quot;</p>
<p>The torpedo shape appeared on the right side of the bubble. &quot;Over here,
Hagbard. We've got more mines ready. We can go after those missiles with mines
like we did the spider ships. Think that would work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's dangerous,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;because the missiles might
explode on contact with the metal and electronic equipment in the mines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're willing to try,&quot; said Howard, and without another word he
swam away.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;I don't like this. There's too
much danger to the porpoises.&quot; He turned to George and shook his head.
&quot;I'm not risking a goddamned thing, and they stand to be blown to bits.
It's not right. I'm not that important.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are risking something,&quot; said George, trying to control the
quaver in his voice. &quot;Those missiles will destroy us if the dolphins don't
stop them.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment, there were four blinding flashes where the orange lights had
been. George gripped the railing, sensing that the shock wave of these
explosions would be worse than that caused by the destruction of the spider
ships. It came. George had been readying himself for it, but unable to tell when
it would come, and it still took him by surprise. Everything shook violently.
Then the bottom dropped out of his stomach, as if the submarine had suddenly
leaped up. George grabbed the railing with both arms, clinging to it as the only
solid thing near him. &quot;O God, we're gonna be killed!&quot; he cried.</p>
<p>'They got the missiles,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;That gives us a fighting
chance. Laser crew, attempt to puncture the <i>Zwack. </i>Fire at will.</p>
<p>Howard reappeared outside the bubble. &quot;How did your people do?&quot;
Hagbard asked him.</p>
<p>&quot;All four of them were killed,&quot; said Howard. &quot;The missiles
exploded when they approached them, just as you predicted.&quot;</p>
<p>George, who was standing up straight now, thankful that Hagbard had simply
ignored his episode of terror, said, &quot;They were killed saving our lives.
I'm sorry it happened, Howard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Laser-beam firing, Hagbard,&quot; a voice announced. There was a pause.
&quot;I think we hit them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You needn't be sorry,&quot; said Howard. &quot;We neither look forward
to death in fear nor back upon it in sorrow. Especially when someone has died
doing something worthwhile. Death is the end of one illusion and the beginning
of another.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What other illusion?&quot; asked George. &quot;When you're dead, you're
dead, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Energy can neither be created nor destroyed,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;Death itself is an illusion.&quot;</p>
<p>These people were talking like some of the Zen students and acid mystics
George had known. If I could feel that way, he thought, I wouldn't be such a
goddamned coward. Howard and Hagbard must be enlightened. I've got to become
enlightened. I can't stand living this way any more. Whatever it took, acid
alone wasn't the answer. George had tried acid already, and he knew that, while
the experience might be wholly remarkable, for him it left little residue in
terms of changed attitudes or behavior. Of course, if you <i>thought </i>your
attitudes and behavior should change, you mimicked other acidheads.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll try to find out what's happening to the <i>Zwack,&quot; </i>said
Howard, and swam away.</p>
<p>&quot;The porpoises do not fear death, they do not avoid suffering, they are
not assailed by conflicts between intellect and feeling and they are not worried
about being ignorant of things. In other words, they have not decided that they</p>
<p>know the difference between good and evil, and in consequence they do not
consider themselves sinners. Understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very few humans consider themselves sinners nowadays,&quot; said
George. &quot;But everyone is afraid of death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All human beings consider themselves sinners. It's just about the
deepest, oldest, and most universal human hangup there is. In fact, it's almost
impossible to speak of it in terms that don't confirm it. To say that human
beings have a universal hangup, as I just did, is to restate the belief that all
men are sinners in different languages. In that sense, the Book of
Genesis—which was written by early Semitic opponents of the Illuminati—is
quite right. To arrive at a cultural turning point where you decide that all
human conduct can be classified in one of two categories, good and evil, is what
creates all sin—plus anxiety, hatred, guilt, depression, all the peculiarly
human emotions. And, of course, such a classification is the very antithesis of
creativity. To the creative mind there is no right or wrong. Every action is an
experiment, and every experiment yields its fruit in knowledge. To the moralist,
every action can be judged as right or wrong—and, mind you, <i>in advance— </i>without
knowing what its consequences are going to be— depending upon the mental
disposition of the actor. Thus the men who burned Giordano Bruno at the stake <i>knew
</i>they were doing good, even though the consequence of their actions was to
deprive the world of a great scientist.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you can never be sure whether what you are doing is good or
bad,&quot; said George, &quot;aren't you liable to be pretty Hamlet-like?&quot;
He was feeling much better now, much less afraid, even though the enemy was
still presumably out there trying to kill him. Maybe he was getting <i>darshan </i>from
Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;What's so bad about being Hamlet-like?&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;Anyway, the answer is no, because you only become hesitant when you
believe there is such a thing as good and evil, and that your action may be one
or the other, and you're not sure which. That was the whole point about Hamlet,
if you remember the play. It was his <i>conscience </i>that made him
indecisive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So he should have murdered a whole lot of people in the first
act?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed. &quot;Not necessarily. He might have decisively killed his
uncle at the earliest opportunity, thus saving the lives of everyone else. Or he
might have said, 'Hey, am I really obligated to avenge my father's death?' and
done nothing. He was due to succeed to the throne anyway. If he had just bided
his time everyone would have been a lot better off, there would have been no
deaths, and the Norwegians would not have conquered the Danes, as they did in
the last scene of the last act. Though being Norwegian myself I would hardly
begrudge Fortinbras his triumph.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment Howard appeared again outside their bubble. 'The <i>Zwack </i>is
retreating. Your laser beam punctured the outer shell, causing a leak in the
fuel-storage cells and putting excessive stress on the pressure-resisting
system. They were forced to climb to higher levels, which put them so far away
from you that they're now heading south toward the tip of Africa.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard expelled a great sigh of relief. &quot;That means they're heading for
their home base. They'll enter a tunnel in the Persian Gulf which will bring
them into the great underground Sea of Valusia, which is deepest beneath the
Himalayas. That was the first base they established. They were preparing it even
before the fall of High Atlantis. It's devilishly well defended. One day we'll
penetrate it though.&quot;</p>
<p>The thing that puzzled Joe most after his illuminization was John Dillinger's
penis. The rumors about the Smithsonian Institute, he knew, were true: even
though any casual phone-caller would get a flat denial from Institute officials,
certain high-placed government people could provide a dispensation and the relic
would be shown, in the legendary alcohol bottle, all legendary 23 inches of it.
But if John was alive, it wasn't his, and, if it wasn't his, whose was it?</p>
<p>&quot;Frank Sullivan's,&quot; Simon said, when Joe finally asked him.</p>
<p>&quot;And who the hell was Frank Sullivan to have a tool like that?&quot;</p>
<p>But Simon only answered, &quot;I don't know. Just some guy who looked like
John.&quot;</p>
<p>Atlantis also bothered Joe, after he saw it the first time Hagbard took him
for a ride in the <i>Lief Erikson. </i>It was all too pat, too plausible, too
good to be true, especially the ruins of cities like Peos, with their
architecture that obvi-</p>
<p>ously combined Egyptian and Mayan elements.</p>
<p>&quot;Science has been flying on instruments, like a pilot in a fog, ever
since nineteen hundred,&quot; he said casually to Hagbard on the return trip to
New York. (This was in '72, according to his later recollections. Fall of
'72—almost two years exactly after the test of AUM in Chicago.)</p>
<p>&quot;You've been reading Bucky Fuller,&quot; was Hagbard's cool reply.
&quot;Or was it Korzybski?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind who I've been reading,&quot; Joe said directly. &quot;The
thought in my head is that I never saw Atlantis, any more than I ever saw
Marilyn Monroe. I saw moving pictures which you told me were television
reception of cameras outside your sub. And I saw moving pictures of what
Hollywood assured me was a real woman, even though she looked more like a design
by Petty or Vargas. In the Marilyn Monroe case, it is reasonable to believe what
I am told: I don't believe a robot that good has been built yet. But Atlantis
... I know special-effects men who could build a city like that on a tabletop,
and have dinosaurs walking through it. And your cameras trained on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You suspect me of trickery?&quot; Hagbard asked raising his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&quot;Trickery is your metier,&quot; Joe said bluntly. &quot;You are the
Beethoven, the Rockefeller, the Michelangelo of deception. The Shakespeare of
the gypsy switch, the two-headed nickel, and the rabbit in the hat. What little
liver pills are to Carter, lies are to you. You dwell in a world of trapdoors,
sliding panels, and Hindu ropetricks. Do I suspect you? Since I met you, I
suspect <i>everybody.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad to hear it,&quot; Hagbard grinned. &quot;You are well on your
way to paranoia. Take this card and keep it in your wallet. When you begin to
understand it, you'll be ready for your next promotion. Just remember: <i>ifs
not true unless it makes you laugh. </i>That is the one and sole and infallible
test of all ideas that will ever be presented to you.&quot; And be handed Joe a
card saying</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THERE IS NO FRIEND ANYWHERE</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Burroughs, incidentally, although he discovered the 23 synchronicity
principle, is unaware of the correlation with 17. This makes it even more
interesting that his date for the invasion of earth by the Nova Mob</p>
<p>(in <i>Nova Express) </i>is September 17, 1899. When I asked him how he
picked that date, he said it just came to him out of the air.</p>
<p>Damn. I was just interrupted by another woman, collecting for the Mothers
March Against Hernia. I only gave her a dime.</p>
<p>W, the 23rd letter, keeps popping up in all this. Note: Weishaupt,
Washington, William S. Burroughs, Charlie Workman, Mendy Weiss, Len Weinglass in
the Conspiracy Trial, and others who will quickly come to mind. Even more
interesting, the first physicist to apply the concept of synchronicity to
physics, after Jung published the theory, was Wolfgang Pauli.</p>
<p>Another suggestive letter-number transformation: Adam Weishaupt (A.W.) is
1-23, and George Washington (G.W.) is 7-23. Spot the hidden 17 in there? But,
perhaps, I grow too imaginative, even whimsical. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a click. George turned. All the time he'd been in the control
center with Hagbard, he had never looked back at the door through which he had
come. He was surprised to see that it looked like an opening in thin air—or
thin water. On either side of the doorway was blue-green water and a dark
horizon which was actually the ocean bottom. Then, in the center, the doorway
itself and a golden light silhouetting the figure of a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Mavis strode onto the balcony, pulling the door shut behind her. She was
wearing forest-green tights with white patent leather boots and a wide white
belt. Her small but well-shaped breasts jiggled naturally under her blouse.
George found himself thinking back to the scene on the beach. That was only this
morning, and what time was it anyway? What time where? Back in Florida it was
probably two or three in the afternoon. Which would make it one P.M. in Mad Dog,
Texas. And probably about six out here in the Atlantic. Did time zones extend
beneath the water? He supposed they did. On the other hand, if you were at the
North Pole, you could skip around the Pole and be in a different time zone every
few seconds. And cross the International Date Line every five minutes if you
wanted to. Which would not, he reminded himself, make it possible to travel hi
time. But if he could go back to this morning and replay Mavis's demand for sex,
this time he would respond! He now wanted her desperately.</p>
<p>Well and good, but why did she say he was <i>not </i>a schmuck, why did she
imply admiration for him because he would not fuck her? If he had fucked her
because she asked him and he felt he should but without wanting to, he would
have been a pure and simple schmuck. But he could have pronged her simply
because she would have been nice to fuck, regardless of whether she would have
admired him or despised him. But that was their game—Mavis's and Hagbard's
game of saying I do what I want to do, and I don't give a damn what you think.
George cared a great deal about what other people thought, so not fucking Mavis
at the time was at least honest, even if he was beginning to see some merit in
the Discordian (he supposed it was Discordian) attitude of super
self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Mavis smiled at him. &quot;Well, George, had your baptism of fire?&quot;</p>
<p>George shrugged. &quot;Well, there was the Mad Dog jail. And I've been in a
few other bad scenes.&quot; For instance, there was the time I held a pistol to
my head and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>She'd sucked his cock, he'd watched her in manic manustupration, but he was
desperate to get inside her, all the way, up the womb, riding her ovarian
trolley to the wonderful land of fuck, as Henry Miller said. What the hell was
so special about Mavis's cunt? Especially after that induction ceremony scene.
Hell, Stella Marls seemed like a less neurotic woman and was certainly a classic
lay. After Stella Maris, who needed Mavis?</p>
<p>A sudden question struck him. How did he know he'd laid Stella? It could have
been Mavis inside that golden apple. It could have been some woman he'd never
met. He was pretty sure it was a woman, unless it was a goat or a cow or a
sheep. Best not put that kind of joke past Hagbard either. But even if it was a
woman, why visualize Stella or Mavis or somebody like them? It was probably some
diseased old Etruscan whore that Hagbard kept around for religious purposes.
Some Sibyl. Some wop witch. Maybe it was Hagbard's rotten old Sicilian mother
with no teeth, a black shawl, and three kinds of VD. No, it was Hagbard's father
who was Sicilian. His mother was Norwegian.</p>
<p>&quot;What color were they?&quot; he said suddenly to Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p>'The Atlanteans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Hagbard nodded. &quot;They were covered with fur over most of
their bodies, like any normal ape. At least, the High Atlanteans were. A
mutation occurred around the time of the Hour of the Evil Eye—the catastrophe
that destroyed High Atlantis. Later Atlanteans, like modern humans, were
hairless. Those of the oldest Atlantean ancestry tend to be rather furry.&quot;
George couldn't help looking down at Hagbard's hand as it rested on the railing.
It was covered with thick black hair.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;it's time to head back to our
North American base. Howard? You out there?&quot;</p>
<p>The long, streamlined shape performed a somersault on their right.
&quot;What's happening, Hagbard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have some of your people keep an eye on things here. We've got work to
do on land. And—Howard, as long as I live I will be in debt to your people for
the four who died to save me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haven't you and the <i>Lief Erickson </i>saved us from several kinds of
deaths planned for us by the shore people?&quot; said Howard. &quot;We'll keep
watch over Atlantis for you. And the seas in general, and that which Atlantis
has spawned. Hail and farewell, Hagbard and other friends—</p>
<p>&quot;The sea is wide and the sea is deep But warm as blood through it there
rolls A tide of friendship that will keep us close in Ocean's blackest
holes.&quot;</p>
<p>He was gone. &quot;Lift off,&quot; Hagbard called. George felt the surge of
the sub's colossal engines, and they were sailing high above the hills and
valleys of Atlantis. With the special lighting of Hagbard's television screen
system, it seemed much like flying in a jet plane over one of the continents
above the ocean's surface.</p>
<p>'Too bad we don't have time to get deeper into Atlantis,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;There are many mighty cities to see. Though of course none of them can
approach the cities that existed before the Hour of the Evil Eye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How many of these Atlantean civilizations were there?&quot; asked
George.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, two. One leading up to the Hour, and one afterward. Before
the Hour, there was a civilization of about</p>
<p>a million human beings on this continent. Technically, they were further
advanced than the human race is today. They had atomic power, space travel,
genetic technology and much else. This civilization was struck a death blow in
the Hour of the Evil Eye. Two-thirds of them were killed —almost half the
human population of the planet at that time. After the Hour, something made it
impossible for them to make a comeback. The cities that came through the first
catastrophe relatively undamaged were destroyed in later disasters. The
inhabitants of Atlantis were reduced to savagery in a generation. Part of the
continent sank under the sea, which was the beginning of the process that ended
when all of Atlantis was under water, as it is today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was this the earthquakes and tidal waves that you always read
about?&quot; George asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Hagbard with a curious closed expression. &quot;It was
manmade. High Atlantis was destroyed in a kind of war. Probably a civil war,
since there was no other power on the planet that could have matched them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway, if there'd been a victor, they'd still be around now,&quot;
said George.</p>
<p>&quot;They are,&quot; said Mavis. &quot;The victors are still around. Only
they're not what you might visualize. Not a conquering nation. And we are the
descendants of the defeated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;I'm going to show you something I
promised when we first met. It has to do with the catastrophe I've been talking
about. Look there.&quot;</p>
<p>The submarine had risen high above the continent, and it was possible to see
landscapes stretching for hundreds of miles. Looking in the direction in which
Hagbard pointed, George saw a vast expanse of black, glazed plain. Out of its
center jutted something white and pointed, like a canine tooth.</p>
<p>&quot;It is said of them that they even controlled the comets in their
courses.&quot; said Hagbard. He pointed again.</p>
<p>The submarine sailed closer to the jutting white object It was a four-sided
white pyramid.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't say it,&quot; said Mavis, giving him a warning look, and George
remembered the tattoo he had seen between her breasts. He looked down again.
They were above the pyramid now and George could see the side that had been
hidden from him as they approached. He saw what he had half-feared,
half-expected to see: a blood-red design in the shape of a baleful eye.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pyramid of the Eye,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;It stood in the
center of the capital of High Atlantis. It was built in the last days of that
civilization by the founders of the world's first religion. It doesn't look very
big from up here, but it's five times the size of the Great Pyramid of Cheops,
which was modeled after it. It's made of an imperishable ceramic substance which
repels even ocean sediment. As if the builders knew that to last it would have
to survive tens of thousands of years of ocean burial. And maybe—depending on
who they were—they did know that. Or maybe they just built well in those days.
Peos, as you saw, was a pretty durable city, and that was built after High
Atlantis fell, by the second civilization I spoke of. That second civilization
reached a level somewhat more advanced than that of the Greeks and Romans, but
it was nothing like its predecessor. And some malevolent force seemed bent on
destroying it, too, and it was destroyed, about ten thousand years ago. Of that
civilization we have the evidence of ruins. But of High Atlantis we have only
records and legends dug up from the later civilization—and, of course, poetry
from the Porpoise Corpus. This is the only artifact, this pyramid. But its
existence and durability prove that as long ago as ten Egypts, a race of men
existed whose technology was far advanced beyond what we know today. So advanced
that it took twenty thousand years for that civilization's successor culture to
disappear completely. The men who destroyed High Atlantis did their best to make
it disappear. But they couldn't quite manage it. The Pyramid of the Eye, for
instance, is indestructible. Though it's probable that they didn't want to
destroy it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mavis nodded sombrely. &quot;That is their most sacred shrine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In other words,&quot; said George, &quot;you're telling me that the
people who destroyed Atlantis still exist. Do they have the powers they had
then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Substantially, yes,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this the Illuminati you told me about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Illuminati, or Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria is one of the names
they have used, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So they didn't start in seventeen seventy-six—they go a long way back
before that, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said Mavis.</p>
<p>&quot;Then why did you lie to me about their history? And why the hell
haven't they taken over the world by now, if</p>
<p>they're all that powerful? When our ancestors were savages, they could have
dominated them completely.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard replied, &quot;I lied to you because the human mind can only accept a
little of the truth at a time. Also, initiation into Discordianism has stages.
The answer to the other question is complicated. But I'll try to give it to you
simply. There are five reasons. First, there are organizations like the
Discordians which are almost as powerful and which know almost as much as the
Illuminati and which are able to thwart them. Second, the Illuminati are too
small a group to enjoy the creative cross-fertilization necessary to progress of
any kind, and they have been unable to advance much beyond the technological
level they reached thirty thousand years ago. Like Chinese Mandarins. Third, the
Illuminati are hamstrung in their actions by the superstitious beliefs that set
them apart from the other Atlanteans. As I told you, they're the world's first
religion. Fourth, the Illuminati are too sophisticated, ruthless and decadent to
want to take over the world—it amuses them to <i>play </i>with world. Fifth,
the Illuminati <i>do </i>rule the world and everything that happens, happens by
their sufferance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those reasons contradict each other,&quot; said George.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the nature of logical thought. AH propositions are true in some
sense, false in some sense and meaningless in some sense.&quot; Hagbard didn't
smile.</p>
<p>The submarine had described a great arc as they talked and now the Pyramid of
the Eye was far behind them. The eye itself, since it faced eastward, was no
longer visible. Below, George could see the ruins of several small cities at the
edges of tall cliffs that fell away into darker depths— cliffs that doubtless
had been the seacoast of Atlantis at one time.</p>
<p>Hagbard said, &quot;I've got a job for you, George. You're going to like it,
and you're going to want to do it, but it is going to make you shit a brick.
We'll talk about it when we get to Chesapeake Base. Now, though, let's go down
into the hold and have a look at our acquisitions.&quot; He flicked a switch.
&quot;FUCKUP, get your finger out of your ass and drive this thing for a
while.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll see the statues later,&quot; said Mavis. &quot;I've got other
things to do just now.&quot;</p>
<p>George followed Hagbard down carpeted staircases and halls paneled in
glowing, polished oak. At last they came</p>
<p>to a large hall which was apparently paved with marble flagstones. A group of
men and women wearing horizontally striped nautical shirts similar to Hagbard's
were clustered around four tall statues in the center of the room. When Hagbard
entered the room they stopped talking and stepped away to give him a clear look
at the sculptures. The floor was covered with puddles of water and the statues
themselves were dripping.</p>
<p>&quot;No wiping them dry,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;Every molecule is
precious just as it is, and the less disturbed the better.&quot; He stepped
closer to the nearest one and looked at it for a long moment. &quot;What do you
say about a thing like this? It's beyond exquisite. Can you imagine what their
art was like <i>before </i>the disaster? And to think the Unbroken Circle
destroyed every trace of it, except for that crude, stupid pyramid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which is the greatest piece of ceramic technology in the history of the
human race,&quot; said one of the women. George looked around for Stella Maris,
but she wasn't there.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's Stella?&quot; he asked Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;Upstairs minding the store. She'll see them later.&quot;</p>
<p>The sculptures were unlike the work of any culture George knew, which was to
be expected, after all. They were at once realistic, fanciful and abstractly
intellectual. They bore resemblance to Egyptian and Mayan, Classical Greek,
Chinese and Gothic, combined with a surprisingly modern-looking note. There were
some qualities in the statues that were totally unique, though, qualities
doubtless lost by the civilizations to which Atlantis was ancestral, but that
might have been found in known world art, had there been other civilizations to
preserve and emphasize them. This, George realized, was the Ur-Art; and looking
at the statues was like hearing a sentence in the first language spoken by men.</p>
<p>An elderly sailor pointed at the statue farthest from where they were
standing. &quot;Look at that beatific smile. A woman thought of that statue,
I'll bet. That's every woman's dream—to be totally self-sufficient.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the time, Joshua,&quot; said the Oriental woman who had spoken
before, &quot;but not all of the time. Now what I prefer is that.&quot; She
pointed to another statue.</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed. &quot;You think that's just nice, healthy oragenitalism,
Tsu-Hsi. But the child in the woman's arms is the Son Without a Father, the
Self-Begotten, and the couple at the base represent the Unbroken Circle of Gruad.
Usually it's a serpent with its tail in its mouth, but in some of the earlier
representations the couple in oral intercourse symbolizes sterile lust. The
Unloved Mother has her foot on the man's head to indicate that she conquers
lust. The whole sculpture is the product of the foulest cult to come out of
Atlantis. They originated human sacrifice. First they practiced castration, but
then they escalated to killing men instead of just cutting off their balls.
Later, when women were subjugated, the sacrifice became a virgin female,
supposedly to give her to the Unloved Ones while she was still pure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That halo around the child's head looks like the peace symbol,&quot;
said George.</p>
<p>&quot;Peace symbol, my ass,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;That's the oldest
symbol of evil there is. Of course, in the cult of the Unbroken Circle it was a
symbol of good, but that's the same difference.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They can't have been so vicious if they produced that statue,&quot;
said the Oriental woman stubbornly.</p>
<p>&quot;Could you deduce the Spanish Inquisition from a painting of the manger
at Bethlehem?&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Don't be naive, Miss Mao.&quot; He
turned to George, &quot;The value of any one of these statues is beyond
calculation. But not many people know that. I'm sending you to one who
does—Robert Putney Drake. One of the finest art connoisseurs in the world, and
the head of the American branch of the world crime syndicate. You're going to
see him with a gift from me—these four statues. The Illuminati were planning
to buy his support with gold from the Temple of Tethys. I'm going to get to him
first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If they only needed four statues, why were they trying to raise the
whole temple?&quot; George asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they wanted to remove the temple to Agharti, their stronghold
under the Himalayas, for safekeeping. I haven't been any closer to the Temple of
Tethys than we were today, but I suspect it's a treasure-house of evidence of
High Atlantis. As such, it would be something the Illuminati would want to
remove. Until now there was no reason to, because no one had access to the
seabottom other than the Illuminati. Now I can get around down here just as
well, better in fact, than they can, and pretty soon others will be following.
Several nations and many groups</p>
<p>of private persons are exploring the undersea world. It's time for the
Illuminati to finish taking away whatever tells of High Atlantis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will they destroy that city we saw? And what about the Pyramid of the
Eye?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard shook his head. &quot;They'd be willing to let later Atlantean ruins
to be found. That wouldn't say anything about their existence. As for the
Pyramid of the Eye, I suspect they have a real problem with that. They can't
destroy it, and even if they could they wouldn't want to. But it's a dead
giveaway to the existence of a supercivilization in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said George, not at all wanting to meet the head of the
American crime syndicate, &quot;what we ought to do is go back and raise the
Temple of Tethys ourselves, before the Illuminati grab it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief,&quot; said Miss Mao. &quot;This happens to be the most
critical moment in the history of this civilization. We don't have time to
fiddle-fuck around with archeology.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's just a legionnaire,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Though after this
mission he'll know the Fairest and become a deacon. He'll understand more then.
George, I want you to act as a go-between for the Discordian movement and the
Syndicate. You're going to bring these four statues to Robert Putney Drake and
tell him there are more where they came from. Ask Drake to stop working for the
Illuminati, to take the heat off our people, wherever he's after them, and to
drop the assassination project the Illuminati have been working on with him. And
as an earnest of good faith, he's to snuff twenty-four Illuminati agents for us
in the next twenty-four hours. Their names will be contained in a sealed
envelope which you'll give him.&quot;</p>
<p>FIVES. SEX. HERE is WISDOM. The mumble of the breast is the mutter of man.</p>
<p>State's Attorney Milo A. Flanagan stood on the roof of the high rise
condominium on Lake Shore Drive in which he lived, scanning blue-gray Lake
Michigan with powerful binoculars. It was April 24, and Project Tethys should be
completed. At any moment Flanagan expected to sight what would look like another
Great Lakes freighter heading for the Chicago River locks. Only this one would
be carrying a dismantled Atlantean temple crated in its hold. The ship would be
recognizable by a red triangle painted on the funnel.</p>
<p>After being inspected by Flanagan (whose name in the Order was Brother Johann
Beghard) and after his report had been sent on to Vigilance Lodge, the North
American command center, the crated temple would be moved downriver to Saint
Louis, where, by prior agreement with the President of the United States, it
would be trucked overland to Fort Knox under the guard of the U.S. Army. The
President didn't know with whom he was dealing. The CIA had informed him that
the source of the artifacts was the Livonian Nationalist Movement, now behind
the Iron Curtain, and that the crates would contain Livonian art treasures.
Certain high officers in the CIA did know the real nature of the organization
which the U.S. was helping, because they were members of it. Of course, the
Syndicate (without even a cover story) was keeping three-quarters of its gold in
with the government store at Fort Knox these days. &quot;Where could you find a
safer place?&quot; Robert Putney Drake once asked.</p>
<p>But the freighter was behind schedule. The wind battered at Flanagan,
whipping his wavy white hair and the well-tailored jacket sleeves and trouser
legs. The goddamned Chicago wind. Flanagan had been fighting it all his life. It
had made him the man he was.</p>
<p>Police Sergeant Otto Waterhouse emerged from the doorway to the roof.
Waterhouse was a member of Flan-agan's personal staff, which meant he was on the
Police Department payroll, the Syndicate payroll, and another payroll that
regularly deposited a fixed sum in the account of Herr Otto Wasserhaus in a
Bavarian bank. Waterhouse was a six-and-a-half-foot-tall black man who had made
a career for himself in the Chicago Police Department by being more willing and
eager to harass, torture, maim, and kill members of his race than the average
Mississippi sheriff. Flanagan had early spotted Waterhouse's ice-cold,
self-hating love affair with death, and had attached him to his staff.</p>
<p>&quot;A message from CFR communications center in New York,&quot; said
Waterhouse. &quot;The word has come through from Ingolstadt that Project Tethys
was aborted.&quot;</p>
<p>Flanagan lowered his binoculars and turned to look at Waterhouse. The State's
Attorney's florid face with its bushy pepper-and-salt eyebrows was shrewd and
distinguished, the sort of face people vote for, especially in Chicago. It was a
face that had once belonged to a kid who had run with the Hamburgers in
Chicago's South Side Irish ghetto and bashed out the brains of black men with
cobblestones for the fun of it. It was a face that had come from that primitive
beginning to knowing about ten-thousand-year-old sunken temples, spider ships,
and international conspiracies. It was stamped indelibly with the lines of Milo
A. Flanagan's ancestors, the ancestors of the Gauls, Britons, Scots, Picts,
Welsh, and Irish. Around the time the Temple of Tethys was sinking into the sea,
they had been driven forth on orders from Agharti from that thick ancient forest
that is now the desert country of Outer Mongolia. But Flanagan was only a
Fourth-degree Illuminatus and not fully instructed in the history. Though he did
not display much emotion there were blue-white flames of murderous madness
burning deep in his eyes. Water-house was one of the few people in Chicago who
could meet Flanagan's baleful stare head-on.</p>
<p>&quot;How did it happen?&quot; Flanagan asked.</p>
<p>&quot;They were attacked by porpoises and an invisible submarine. The spider
craft were all blown to bits. The <i>Zwack </i>came in and counterattacked, was
damaged by a laser beam and forced to disengage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did they find out we had spider ships at the temple site?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the porpoises told them.&quot;</p>
<p>Flanagan looked at Waterhouse coldly and thoughtfully. &quot;Maybe it leaked
at this end, Otto. There are JAMs active in this town, more here than anywhere
in the country right now. Dillinger has been spotted twice in the last week. By
Gruad, how I'd like to be the one to <i>really </i>get him, once and for all!
What would Hoover's ghost say then, huh, Otto?&quot; Flanagan grinned, one of
his rare genuine smiles, exposing prominent canine teeth. &quot;We know there's
a JAM cult center somewhere on the North Side. Someone's been stealing hosts
from my brother's church for the past ten years—even at times when I've had as
many as thirty men staked out there. And my brother says that there have been
more cases of demonic possession in his parish in the last five years than in
all of Chicago in all its previous history. One of our sensitives has reported
emanations of the Old Woman in this area at least once a month during the past
year. It's long past time we found them. They could be reading our minds, Otto.
That could be the leak. Why haven't we got a fix on them?&quot;</p>
<p>Waterhouse, who only a few years ago had known nothing more unconventional
than how to turn a homicide into &quot;killed while resisting arrest,&quot;
looked back calmly at Flanagan and said, &quot;We need ten sensitives of the
fifth grade to form the pentacle, and we've only got seven.&quot;</p>
<p>Flanagan shook his head. &quot;There are seventeen fifth graders in Europe,
eight in Africa, and twenty-three scattered around the rest of the world. You'd
think they could spare us three for a week. That's all it would take.&quot;</p>
<p>Waterhouse said, &quot;Maybe you've got enemies in the higher circle. Maybe
somebody wants to see us get it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why the hell do you say things like that, Waterhouse?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just to fuck you up, man.&quot;</p>
<p>Eight floors below, in an apartment which was regularly used for black
masses, a North Clark street hippie named Skip Lynch opened his eyes and looked
at Simon Moon and Padre Pederastia. 'Time's getting very short,&quot; he said.
&quot;We've got to finish off Flanagan soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It can't be too soon for me,&quot; said Padre Pederastia. &quot;If
Daddy hadn't favored him so outrageously he'd be the priest today and I'd be
State's Attorney.&quot;</p>
<p>Simon nodded. &quot;But then we'd be snuffing you instead of Milo. Anyway, I
believe George Dorn will be taking care of the problem for us right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Squinks? It all began with the squinks—and that sentence is more true than
you will realize until long after this mission is over, Mr. Muldoon.</p>
<p>It was the night of February 2, 1776, and it was dark and windy in Ingolstadt;
in fact, Adam Weishaupt's study looked like a set for a Frankenstein movie, with
its windows rattling and candles flickering, and old Adam himself casting
terrifying shadows as he paced back and forth with his peculiar lurching gait.
At least the shadows were terrifying to <i>him, </i>because he was flying high
on the new hemp extract that Kolmer had brought back from his last visit to
Baghdad. To calm himself, he was repeating his English vocabulary-building
drill, working on the new words for that week. &quot;Tomahawk . . . Succotash .
. . Squink. <i>Squink?&quot; </i>He laughed out loud. The word was
&quot;skunk,&quot; but he had short-circuited from there to &quot;squid&quot;
and emerged with &quot;squink.&quot; A new word: a new concept. But what would a
squink look like? Midway between a squid and a skunk, no doubt: it would have
eight arms and smell to <i>hoch Himmel. </i>A horrible thought: it reminded him,
uncomfortably, of the shoggoths in that damnable <i>Necronomicon </i>that
Kolnier was always trying to get him to read when he was stoned, saying that was
the only way to understand it.</p>
<p>He lurched over to the Black Magic and Pornography section of his
bookshelves—which he kept, sardonically, next to his Bible commentaries—and
took down the long-forbidden volume of the visions of the mad poet Abdul
Alhazred. He turned to the first drawing of a shoggoth. Strange, he thought, how
a creature so foul could also, from certain angles and especially when you were
high, look vaguely like a crazily grinning rabbit. <i>&quot;Du haxen Hase,&quot;
</i>he chortled to himself. . . .</p>
<p>Then his mind made the leap: five sides on the borders on the shoggoth
sketches . . . five sides, always, on all the shoggoth sketches . . . and
&quot;squid&quot; and &quot;skunk&quot; both had five letters in them. . . .</p>
<p>He held up his hands, looked at the five fingers on each, and began to laugh.
It was all clear suddenly: the Sign of the Horns made by holding up the first
two fingers in a V and folding the other three down: the two, the three and
their union in the five. Father, Son and Holy Devil . . . the Duality of good
and evil, the Trinity of the Godhead ... the bicycle and the tricycle. ... He
laughed louder and louder, looking—despite his long, thin face—like the
Chinese statues of the Laughing Buddha.</p>
<p>While the gas chambers were operating, other features of life in the camps
were also contributing to the Final Solution. At Auschwitz, for instance, many
perished from beatings and other forms of ill treatment, but the general neglect
of elementary sanitary and health precautions had the most memorable results.
First there was spotted fever, then paratyphoid fever and abdominal typhus
erysipelas. Tuberculosis, of course, was rampant, and—particularly amusing to
certain of the officers—incurable diarrhea brought death to many inmates,
degrading as it killed. No attempt was made, either, to prevent the ubiquitous
camp rats from attacking those too ill to move or defend themselves. Never
before witnessed by twentieth-century doctors, noma also appeared and was
recognized only from the descriptions in old textbooks: it is the complication
of malnutrition which eats holes in the cheeks until you can see right through
to the teeth. <i>&quot;Vernichtung,&quot; </i>a survivor said later, &quot;is
the most terrible word in any language.&quot;</p>
<p>Even so, the Aztecs grew more frantic toward the end, increasing the number
of sacrifices, doubling and tripling the days of the year that called for
spilled blood. But nothing saved them: just as Eisenhower's army advanced across
Europe to end the ovens of Auschwitz, Cortez and his ships moved toward the
great pyramid, the statue of Tlaloc, the confrontation.</p>
<p>Seven hours after Simon spoke of George Dorn to Padre Pederastia, a private
jet painted gold landed at Kennedy International Airport. Four heavy crates were
moved by crane from the belly of the plane into a truck which bore on its side
the sign &quot;GOLD &amp; APPEL TRANSFERS.&quot; A young man with
shoulder-length blond hair, wearing a fashionable cutaway and knee breeches of
red velvet with bottle-green silk stockings, stepped down from the plane and
climbed into the cab of the truck. Holding an alligator briefcase in his lap, he
sat silently beside the driver.</p>
<p>Tobias Knight, the driver, kept his thoughts to himself and asked no
questions.</p>
<p>George Dorn was frightened. It was a feeling he was getting used to, so
accustomed in fact that it no longer seemed to stop him from doing insane
things. Besides, Hagbard had given him a talisman against harm, assuring him
that it was 100 percent infallible. George slipped it out of his pocket and
glanced at it again, curiously and with a wan hope. It was gold-tinted card with
the strange glyphs:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1025"

<img src="1.htm8.jpg" alt="illum-part2-8.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025" width="232" height="92"></span></p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;
mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">It was probably another of Hagbard's jokes, George
decided. It might even be Etruscan for &quot;Kick this boob in the ass.&quot;
Hagbard's refusal to translate it suggested some such Celinean irony, and yet he
had seemed very sober—almost religious—about the symbols.</span>
<p>One thing was sure: George was still frightened, but the fear was no longer
paralyzing. If I was this casual about fear a few years ago, he thought, there'd
be one less cop in New York. And I wouldn't be here either, probably. No, that's
not right, either. I would have told Carlo to go fuck himself. I wouldn't have
let the fear of being called a copout stop me. George had been scared when he
went to Mad Dog, when Harry Coin tried to fuck him up the ass, when Harry Coin
was killed, when he escaped from the Mad Dog jail, when he saw his own death
just as he was coming, and when the Illuminati spider ships had attacked the <i>Lief
Erickson. </i>Being scared was beginning to seem a normal condition to him.</p>
<p>So now he was going to meet the men who ran organized crime in the U.S. He
knew practically nothing about the Syndicate and the Mafia, and what little he
did know he tended to disbelieve on the grounds that it was probably myth.
Hagbard had sketched in a little additional information for him while he was
preparing for this flight. But the one thing that George was absolutely certain
about was that he was going unprotected among men who killed human beings as
easily as a housewife kills silverfish. And he was supposed to negotiate with
them. The Syndicate had been working with the Illuminati until now. Now they
were supposed to switch over to the Discordians, on George's say-so. With, of
course, the help of four priceless statues. Except, what were Robert Putney
Drake and Federico Maldonado going to say when they heard these statues had been
dredged up from the bottom of the ocean floor out of the ruins of Atlantis? They
would probably express their skepticism with pistols and send George back to the
place he claimed the statues came from.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Why me?&quot; George had asked Hagbard earlier that day.</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Why me?&quot; Hagbard repeated with a smile. &quot;The question
asked by the soldier as the enemy bullets whistle around him, by the harmless
homeowner as the homicidal maniac steps through the kitchen door hunting knife
in hand, by the woman who has given birth to a dead baby, by the prophet who has
just had a revelation of the word of God, by the artist who knows his latest
painting is a work of genius. Why you? Because you're there, schmuck. Because
something has to happen to you. OK?&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;But what if I fuck it up? I don't know anything about your
organization or the Syndicate. If times are as crucial as you say, ifs silly to
send somebody like me on this mission. I have no experience meeting people like
this.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>Hagbard shook his head impatiently. &quot;You underrate yourself. Just
because you're young and afraid you think you can't talk to people. That's
stupid. And it's not typical of your generation, so you should be all the more
ashamed</i></p>
<p><i>of yourself. Furthermore, you are experienced with even worse people than
Drake and Maldonado. You spent part of a night in a cell with the man who killed
John F. Kennedy.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;What?&quot; George felt the blood rush out of his face and he
thought he might faint.</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; said Hagbard casually. &quot;Joe Malik was on the
right track when he sent you to Mad Dog, you know.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>After all that, Hagbard told George he was perfectly free to turn down the
mission if he didn't want to go. And George said he would go for the same reason
he had agreed to accompany Hagbard on his golden submarine. Because he knew that
he would have been a fool to pass up the experience.</i></p>
<p>A two-hour drive brought the truck to the outskirts of Blue Point, Long
Island, to the gates of an estate. Two heavy-set men in green coveralls searched
George and the driver, pointed the bell-shaped nozzle of an instrument at the
truck and studied some dials, and then waved them through. They drove up a
winding, narrow asphalt road through woods just beginning to show the light
green budding of early spring. Shadowy figures prowled among the trees. Suddenly
the road burst out of the woods and into a meadow. From here there was a long
gentle rising slope to the top of a hill that was crowned by houses. From the
edge of the woods George could see four large, comfortable-looking cottages,
each three stories high, a little smaller than Newport, a little larger than
Atlantic City. They were made of brick painted in seaside pastel colors and
formed a semicircle on the crest of the hill. The grass of the meadow was cut
very short, and halfway up the hill it became a beautifully manicured lawn The
woods screened the houses from the road, the meadow made it impossible for
anyone emerging from woods to approach the houses without being seen, and the
houses themselves constituted the elements of a fortress.</p>
<p>The Gold &amp; Appel truck followed the driveway, which led between two of
the houses, rolling over slots in the driveway where a section might be
hydraulically raised to form a wall. The driver stopped at a gesture from one of
two men in khakis who approached. George could now see the Syndicate fortress
consisted of eight separate houses forming an octagon around a lawn. Each house
had its own fenced-in yard, and George noticed with surprise that there was play
equipment for children in front of several cottages. In the center of the
compound was a tall white pole from which Sew an American flag.</p>
<p>George and the driver stepped down from the cab of the truck. George
identified himself and was ushered to the far side of the compound. The hill was
much steeper on this side, George saw. It sloped down to a narrow boulder-strewn
beach drenched by huge Atlantic waves. A nice view, George thought. And
eminently secure. The only way Drake's enemies could get at him would be to
shell his home from a destroyer.</p>
<p>A slender, blond man—at least sixty and maybe a well-preserved
seventy—came down the steps of the house George was approaching. He had a
concave nose that ended in a sharp point, a strong, cleft chin, ice-blue eyes.
He shook hands vigorously.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi. I'm Drake. The others are inside. Let's go. Oh—is it OK with you
if we go ahead and unload your truck?&quot; He gave George a sharp, birdlike
look. George realized with a sinking feeling that Drake was saying that they
would take the statues regardless of whether any deal went through. Why, then,
should they inconvenience themselves by changing sides in this underground war?
But he nodded in acquiescence.</p>
<p>&quot;You're young, aren't you?&quot; said Drake as they went into the house.
&quot;But that's the way it is nowadays. Boys do men's work.&quot; The house was
handsome inside, but not as one might expect, incredible. The carpets were
thick, the woodwork heavy, dark and polished, the furnishings probably genuine
antiques. George didn't see how Atlantean statues would fit into the decor.
There was a painting at the top of the stairs to the second floor of a woman who
looked slightly like Queen Elizabeth II. She wore a white gown with diamonds at
her neck and wrists. Two small, fragile-looking blond boys in navy blue suits
with white satin ties stood with her, staring solemnly out of the painting.</p>
<p>&quot;My wife and sons,&quot; said Drake with a smile.</p>
<p>They entered a large study full of mahogany, oak paneling, leatherbound books
and red and green leather furniture. Theodore Roosevelt would have loved it,
George thought. Over the desk hung a painting of a bearded man in Elizabethan
costume. He was holding a bowling ball in his hand and looking superciliously at
a messenger type</p>
<p>who pointing out to sea. There were sailing ships in the distant background.</p>
<p>&quot;An ancestor,&quot; said Drake simply. He pressed a button in a panel on
the desk. A door opened and two men came in, the first a tall young Chinese with
a boney face and unruly black hair, the second a short, thin man who bore a
faint resemblance to Pope Paul VI.</p>
<p>&quot;Don Federico Maldonado, a man of the greatest respect,&quot; said
Drake. &quot;And Richard Jung, my chief counselor.&quot; George shook hands with
both of them. He couldn't understand why Maldonado was known as
&quot;Banana-Nose&quot;; his proboscus was on the large side, but bore little
resemblance to a banana. It was more like an eggplant. The name must be a sample
of low Sicilian humor. The two men took seats on a red leather couch. George and
Drake sank into armchairs facing them.</p>
<p>&quot;And how are my favorite musicians doing?&quot; Jung said genially.</p>
<p>Was this some kind of password? George was sure of one thing: his survival
depended on sticking absolutely to truth and sincerity with these people, so he
said, very sincerely, &quot;I don't know. Who are your favorite musicians?&quot;</p>
<p>Jung smiled back, saying nothing, until George, his heart racing inside his
chest like a hamster determined to run clear off the treadmill, reached into his
briefcase and took out a parchment scroll.</p>
<p>&quot;This,&quot; he said, &quot;is the fundamental agreement proposed by the
people I represent.&quot; He handed it to Drake. Maldonado, he noticed, was
staring fixedly, expressionlessly, at him in the most unnerving way. The man's
eyes looked as if they were made of glass. His face was a waxen mask. He was,
George decided, a wax dummy of Pope Paul VI which had been stolen from Madame
Tussaud's, dressed in a business suit, and brought to life to serve as the head
of the Mafia. George had always thought there was something witchy about
Sicilians.</p>
<p>&quot;Do we sign this in blood?&quot; said Drake, removing the cloth-of-gold
ribbon from the parchment and unrolling it.</p>
<p>George laughed nervously. &quot;Pen and ink will do fine.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul's angry, triumphant eyes stare into mine, and I look away guiltily. <i>Let
me explain, </i>I say desperately. / <i>really am trying to help you. Your mind
is a bomb.</i></p>
<p>&quot;What Weishaupt discovered that night of February second, seventeen
seventy-six,&quot; Hagbard Celine explained</p>
<p>to Joe Malik in 1973, on a clear autumn day in Miami, about the same time
that Captain Tequilla y Mota was reading Luttwak on the coup d'etat and making
his first moves toward recruiting the officer's cabal that later seized Fernando
Poo, &quot;was basically a simple mathematical relationship. It's so simple, in
fact, that most administrators and bureaucrats never notice it. lust as the
householder doesn't notice the humble termite, until it's too late. . . . Here,
take this paper and figure for yourself. How many permutations are there in a
system of four elements?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe, recalling his high school math, wrote 4x3x2x1, and read aloud his answer
&quot;Twenty-four.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if you're one of-the elements, the number of coalitions—or to be
sinister, conspiracies—that you may have to confront would be twenty-three.
Despite Simon Moon's obsessions, the twenty-three has no particularly mystic
significance,&quot; Hagbard added quickly. &quot;Just consider it
pragmatically—it's a number of possible relationships which the brain can
remember and handle. But now suppose the system has five elements . . . ?.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe wrote 5x4x3x2x1 and read aloud, &quot;One hundred and twenty.&quot;
&quot;You see? One always encounters jumps of that size when dealing with
permutations and combinations. But, as I say, administrators as a rule aren't
aware of this. Korzybski pointed out, back in the early thirties, that nobody
should ever <i>directly </i>supervise more than four subordinates, because the
twenty-four possible coalitions ordinary office politics can create are enough
to tax any brain. When it jumps up to one hundred and twenty, the administrator
is lost. That, in essence, is the sociological aspect of the mysterious Law of
Fives. The Illuminati always has five leaders in each nation, and five
international Illuminati Primi supervising all of them, but each runs his own
show more or less independent of the other four, united only by their common
commitment to the Goal of Gruad.&quot; Hagbard paused to relight his long, black
Italian cigar.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;put yourself in the position of the head of
any counterespionage organization. Imagine, for instance, that you're poor old
McCone of the CIA at the time of the first of the New Wave of Illuminati
assassinations, ten years ago, in sixty-three. Oswald was, of course, a double
agent, as everybody always knew. The Russians wouldn't have let him out of
Russia without getting a commitment from him to do 'small jobs,' as they're
called in the business, although he'd be a 'sleeper.' That is, he'd go about his
ordinary business most of the time, and only be called on occasionally when he
was in the right place at the right time for a particular 'small job.' Now, of
course, Washington knows this; they know that no expatriate comes back from
Moscow without some such agreement And Moscow knows the other side: that the
State Department wouldn't take him back unless he accepted a similar status with
the CIA. Then, November twenty-second, Dealy Plaza—blam! the shit hits the
fan. Moscow and Washington both want to know, the sooner the quicker, who was he
working for when he did it, or was it his own idea? Two more possibilities loom
at once: could a loner with confused politics like him have been recruited by
the Cubans or the Chinese? And, then, the kicker: could he be innocent? Could
another group—to avoid the obvious, let's call them Force X—have
stage-managed the whole thing? So, you've got MVD and CIA and FBI and who-all
falling over each other sniffing around Dallas and New Orleans for clues. And
Force X gets to seem more and more implausible to all of them, because it is
intrinsically incredible. It is incredible because it has no skeleton, no shape,
no flesh, nothing they can grab hold of. The reason is, of course, that Force X
is the Illuminati, working through five leaders with five times four times three
times two times one, or one hundred and twenty different basic vectors. A
conspiracy with one hundred and twenty vectors doesn't look like a conspiracy:
it looks like chaos. The human mind can't grasp it, and hence declares it
nonexistent. You see, the Illuminati is always careful to keep a random element
in the one hundred and twenty vectors. They didn't <i>really </i>need to recruit
both the leaders of the ecology movement <i>and </i>the executives of the worst
pollution-producing corporations. They did it to create ambiguity. <i>Anybody </i>who
tries to describe their operations sounds like a paranoid. What clinched
it,&quot; Hagbard concluded, &quot;was a real stroke of luck for the Weishaupt
gang: there were two other elements involved, which nobody had planned or
foreseen. One was the Syndicate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It always starts with nonsense,&quot; Simon is telling Joe in another
time-track, between Los Angeles and San Francisco, in 1969. &quot;Weishaupt
discovered the Law of Fives while he was stoned and looking at one of those
shoggoth pictures you saw in Arkham. He imagined the shoggoth was a rabbit and
said, <i>'du hexen Hase,' </i>which has been preserved as an in-joke by
Illuminati agents in Hollywood. It runs through the Bugs Bunny cartoons: 'You
wascal wabbitl' But out of that schizzy mixture of hallucination and logomania,
Weishaupt saw both the mystic meaning of the Five and its pragmatic application
as a principal of international espionage, using permutations and combinations
that I'll explain when we have a pencil and paper. That same mixture of
revelation and put-on is always the language of the supra-conscious, whenever
you contact it, whether through magic, religion, psychedelics, yoga, or a
spontaneous brain nova. Maybe the put-on or nonsense part comes by contamination
from the unconscious, I don't know. But it's always there. That's why serious
people never discover anything of real importance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean the Mafia?&quot; Joe asks.</p>
<p>&quot;What? I didn't say anything about the Mafia. Are you in another
time-track again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not the Mafia alone,&quot; Hagbard says. &quot;The Syndicate is
much bigger than the Maf.&quot; The room returns to focus: it is a restaurant. A
seafood restaurant. On Bis-cayne Avenue, facing the bay. In Miami. In 1973. The
walls are decorated with undersea motifs, including a huge octopus. Hagbard,
undoubtedly, had chosen this meeting place just because he liked the decor.
Crazy bastard thinks he's Captain Nemo. Still: we've got to deal with him. As
John says, the JAMs can't do it alone. Hagbard, grinning, seemed to be noting
Joe's return to present time. &quot;You're reaching the critical stage,&quot; he
said changing the subject. &quot;You now only have two mental states: high on
drugs and high without drugs. That's very good. But as I was saying, the
Syndicate is more than just the Maf. The only Syndicate, up until October
twenty-third, nineteen thirty-five, was nothing more than the Mafia, of course.
But then they killed the Dutchman, and a young psychology student, who also
happened to be a psychopath with a power drive like Genghis Khan, was assigned
to do a paper on how the Dutchman's last words illustrate the similarity between
somatic damage and schizophrenia. The Dutchman had a bullet in his gut while the
police interviewed him, and they recorded everything he said, but on the surface
it was all gibberish. This psychology student wrote the paper that his professor
expected, and got an <i>A </i>for the course—but he also wrote another
interpretation of the Dutchman's words, for his own purposes. He put copies in
several bank vaults—he came from one of the oldest banking families in New
England, and he was even then under family pressure to give up psychology and go
into banking. His name was (Robert Putney Drake visited Zurich in 1935. He
personally talked to Carl Jung about the archetypes of the collective
unconscious, the <i>I</i> <i>Ching, </i>and the principle of synchronicity. He
talked to people who had known James Joyce before that drunken Irish genius had
moved to Paris, and learned much about Joyce's drunken claims to be a prophet.
He read the published portions of <i>Finnegans Wake </i>and went back for
further conversations with Jung. Then he met Hermann Hesse, Paul Klee and the
other members of the Eastern Brotherhood and joined them in a mescaline ritual.
A letter from his father arrived about then, asking when he was going to give up
wasting his time and return to Harvard Business School. He wrote that he would
return for the fall semester, but not to study business administration. A great
psychologist was almost born then, and Harvard might have had its Timothy Leary
scandal thirty years earlier. Except for Drake's power drive.)</p>

<p>This delusion that you are a man trapped in a woman's body can only be cured
one way. I might be kicked out of the American Psychoanalystical Association if
they knew about my methods. In fact, already had a spot of bother with them when
one of my patients cured his Oedipus complex by actually fucking his mother,
convincing himself extensionally as the semanticists would say that she really
was an old lady and not the woman he remembered from infancy. Nevertheless, the
whole world is going bananas as you must have observed, my poor girl, and we
have to use heroic measures to save whatever sanity remains in any patient we
encounter. <i>(The psychiatrist is now naked. He joins her on the bed.) </i>Now,

arranges them in suits, and hunts for the lost card: it is the Five of

<p>&quot;It's probably all jumbled in your head,&quot; I went on, furious that
our plan was falling apart, that I needed his trust now but had no way to earn
it. &quot;We've been disintoxicating and dehypnotizing you, but you almost
certainly can't tell where the Illuminati left off and we rescued you and
started reversing the treatment. You're due to explode into psychosis within
twenty-four hours and we're using the only techniques that can defuse that
process.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why am I hearing everything twice?&quot; Saul asked, balancing between
wary skepticism and a sense that Malik was not playing games any more but
urgently trying to help him.</p>
<p>&quot;The stuff they gave you was an MDA derivative—very high on mescaline
and methedrine both. It has an echo effect for seventy-two hours minimum. You're
hearing what I'm going to say before I say it and then again when I do say it.
That'll pass in a few minutes, but it'll be back, every half hour or so, for the
next day yet. The end of the chain is psychosis, unless we can stop it.&quot;
&quot;Unless we can stop it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's easing up now,&quot; Saul said carefully, &quot;Less of an echo
that time. I still don't know whether to trust you. Why were you trying to turn
me into Barney Muldoon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because the psychic explosion is on Saul Goodman's time-track, not on
Barney Muldoon's.&quot;</p>

At the same time, he hears the strange man in the bed asking, &quot;Why were you

<p>All the Helen Hokinson types are out today. Another one just hit me for the
Mothers March Against Dandruff. I gave her a nickel.</p>
<p>1923 was a very interesting year for the occult, by the way. Not only did
Hitler join the Illuminati and attempt the Munich putsch, but, glancing through
the books of Charles Fort, I found quite a few suggestive events. On March
17th—which not only fits our IT-23 correlation but is also the anniversary of
the defeat of the Kronstadt rebellion, the day the Lord Nelson statue was bombed
in Dublin in 1966 and, of course, good Saint Patrick's holy day—a naked man
was seen mysteriously running about the estate of Lord Caernarvon in England. He
appeared several times in the following days, but was never caught. Meanwhile,
Lord Caernarvon himself died in Egypt—some said he was a victim of the curse
of Tut-Ankh-Amen, whose tomb he had burglarized. (An archaeologist is a ghoul
with credentials.) Fort also records two cases that May of a synchronistic
phenomenon he has traced through the centuries: a volcanic eruption coinciding
with the discovery of a new star. In September, there was a Mumiai scare in
India—Mumiais are invisible demons that grab people in broad daylight.
Throughout the year, there were reports of exploding coal in England; some tried
to explain this by saying the embittered miners (it was a time of labor
troubles) were putting dynamite in the coal, but the police couldn't prove this.
The coal went on exploding. In the summer, French pilots began having strange
mishaps, whenever they flew over Germany, and it was suggested that the Germans
were testing an invisible ray machine. Considering the last three phenomena
together—invisible demons in India, exploding coal in England, invisible rays
over Germany—I guess somebody was testing something. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can call me Doc Iggy. My full name, at present, is Dr. Ignotum P.
Ignotius. The P. stands for Per. If you're a Latinist, you'll realize that
translates as &quot;the unknown explained by the still more unknown.&quot; I
think it's a quite appropriate name for my function tonight, since Simon brought
you here to be illuminized. My slave name, before I was turned on myself, is
totally immaterial. As far as I'm concerned, your slave name is equally
pointless, and I'll call you by the password of the Norton Cabal, which Simon
used at the door. Until tomorrow morning, when the drug starts wearing off, you
are U. Wascal Wabbit. That's U., the initial, not why-oh-you, by the way.</p>
<p>We accept Bugs Bunny as an exemplar of Mummu here, too, but otherwise we have
little in common with the SSS. That's the Satanist, Surrealists and
Sadists—the crew who began your illuminization in Chicago. All we share with
them actually is use of the Tristero anarchist postal system, to evade the
government's postal inspectors, and a financial agreement whereby we accept
their DMM script—Divine Marquis Memorial script—and they accept our
hempscript and the flaxscript of the Legion of Dynamic Discord. Anything to
avoid Federal Reserve notes, you know.</p>
<p>It'll be a while yet before the acid starts working, so I'll just chat like
this, about things that are more or less trivial—or quadrivial, or maybe
pentivial—until I can see that you're ready for more serious matters. Simon's
in the chapel, with a woman named Stella who you'll really dig, getting things
ready for the ceremony.</p>
<p>You might wonder why we're called the Norton Cabal. The name was chosen by my
predecessor, Malaclypse the Younger, before he left us to join the more esoteric
group known as ELF—the Erisian Liberation Front. They're the Occidental branch
of the Hung Mung Tong Cong and all</p>
<p>their efforts go into a long-range anti-Illuminati project known only as
Operation Mindfuck. But that's another, very complicated, story. One of
Malaclypse's last writings, before he went into the Silence, was a short
paragraph saying, &quot;Everybody understands Mickey Mouse. Few understand
Hermann Hesse. Hardly anyone understands Albert Einstein. And nobody understands
Emperor Norton.&quot; I guess Malaclypse was already into the Mindfuck mystique
when he wrote that.</p>
<p><i>(Who was Emperor Norton? Joe asks, wondering if the drug is beginning to
work already or Dr. Ignotius just has a tendency to speak more slowly than most
people.)</i></p>
<p>Joshua Norton, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico. San
Francisco is proud of him. He lived in the last century and got to be emperor by
proclaiming himself as such. <i>For some mysterious reason, </i>the newspapers
decided to humor him and printed his proclamations. When he started issuing his
own money, the local banks <i>went along with the joke </i>and accepted it on
par with U.S. currency. When the Vigilantes got into a lynching mood one night
and decided to go down to Chinatown and kill some Chinese, Emperor Norton
stopped them <i>just by standing in the street with his eyes closed reciting the
Lord's Prayer. </i>Are you beginning to understand Emperor Norton a little, Mr.
Wabbit?</p>
<p><i>(A little, Joe said, a little . </i>. .)</p>
<p>Well, chew on this for a while, friend: there were two very sane and rational
anarchists who lived about the same time as Emperor Norton across the country in
Massachusetts: William Green and Lysander Spooner. They also realized the value
of having competing currencies instead of one uniform State currency, and they
tried logical arguments, empirical demonstrations and legal suits 'to get this
idea accepted. They accomplished nothing. The government broke its own laws to
find ways to suppress Green's Mutual Bank and Spooner's People's Bank. That's
because they were obviously sane, and their currency did pose a real threat to
the monopoly of the Illuminati. But Emperor Norton was so crazy that people <i>humored
</i>him and his currency was allowed to circulate. Think about it. You might
begin to understand why Bugs Bunny is our symbol and why our currency has the
ridiculous name hempscript. Hagbard Celine and his Discordians, even more
absurdly, call their money flaxscript. That commemorates the Zen Master who was
asked, &quot;What is the Buddha?&quot; and replied, &quot;Five pounds of
flax.&quot; Do you begin to see the full dimensions of our struggle with the
Illuminati?</p>
<p>At least, for now, you can probably grasp this much: their fundamental
fallacy is the Aneristic Delusion. They <i>really </i>believe in law 'n' order.
As a matter of fact, since everybody in this crazy, millennia-old battle has his
own theory about what the Illuminati are really aiming at, I might as well tell
you mine. I think they're all scientists and they want to set up a scientific
world government. The Jacobins were probably following precise Illuminati
instructions when they sacked the churches in Paris and proclaimed the dawn of
the Age of Reason. You know the story about the old man who was in the crowd
when Louis XVI went to the guillotine and who shouted as the king's head fell,
&quot;Jacques De Molay, thou art avenged&quot;? All the symbols that De Molay
introduced into Masonry are scientific implements—the T-square, the
architect's triangle, even that pyramid that has caused so much bizarre
speculation. If you count the eye as part of the design, the pyramid has 73
divisions, you know, not 72. What's 73 mean? Simple: multiply it by five, in
accordance with Weishaupt's <i>funfwissenschaft, </i>the science of fives, and
you get 365, the days of the year. The damn thing is some kind of astronomical
computer, like Stonehenge. The Egyptian pyramids are facing to the East, where
the sun rises. The great pyramid of the Mayans has exactly 365 divisions, and is
also facing to the East. What they're doing is worshipping the &quot;order&quot;
they have found in Nature, never realizing that they projected the order there
with their own instruments.</p>
<p>That's why they hate ordinary mankind—because we're so disorderly. They've
been trying for six or seven thousand years to reestablish Atlantis-style high
civilization— law 'n' order—the Body Politic, as they like to call it. A
giant robot is what their Body Politic really amounts to, you know. A place for
everything and everything in its place. A place for everybody and everybody in
his place. Look at the Pentagon—look at the whole army, for Goddess's sake!
That's what they want the planet to be like Efficient, mechanical,
orderly—very orderly—and inhuman. That's the essence of the Aneristic
Delusion: to imagine you have found Order and then to start manipulating the
quirky, eccentric chaotic things that really exist into some kind of platoons or
phalanxes that correspond to your concept of the Order they're supposed to
manifest. Of course, the quirkiest, most chaotic things that exist are other
people—and that's why they're so obsessed with trying to control us.</p>
<p>Why are you staring like that? Am I changing colors or growing bigger or
something? Good: the acid is starting to work. Now we can really get to the
nitty-gritty. First of all, most of what I've been telling you is bullshit. The
IIluminati have no millennia-old history; neither do the JAMs. They invented
their great heritage and tradition— Jacques De Molay and Charlemagne and all
of it—out of whole cloth in 1776, picking up all sorts of out-of-context
history to make it seem plausible. We've done the same. You might wonder why we
copy them, and even deceive our own recruits about this. Well, part of
illumination— and we've got to be illuminized ourselves to fight them—is in
learning to doubt everything. That's why Hagbard has that painting in his
stateroom saying &quot;Think for yourself, schmuck,&quot; and why Hassan i
Sabbah said <i>&quot;Nothing </i>is true.&quot; You've got to learn to doubt us,
too, and everything we tell you. There are no honest men on this voyage. In
fact, maybe <i>this part </i>is the only lie I've told you all evening, and the
Illuminati history before 1776 really is true and not an invention. Or maybe
we're just a front for the Illuminati... to recruit you indirectly. . . .</p>
<p>Feeling paranoid? Good: illumination is on the other side of absolute terror.
And the only terror that is truly absolute is the horror of realizing that you
can't believe anything you've ever been told. You have to realize fully that you
<i>are </i>&quot;a stranger and afraid in a world you never made,&quot; like
Houseman says.</p>
<p><i>Twenty-two big rhinoceroses, twenty-three big. rhinoceroses .. .</i></p>
<p>The Illuminati basically were structure-freaks. Hence, their hangup on
symbols of geometric law and architectural permanence, especially the pyramid
and the pentagon. (God's Lightning, like all authoritarian Judeo-Christian
heresies, had its own share of this typically Occidental straight-line mystique,
which was why even the Jews among them, like Zev Hirsch, accepted the symbol
first suggested by Atlanta Hope: that most Euclidean of all religious emblems:
the Cross.) The Discordians made their own sardonic commentary on the legal and
scientific basis</p>
<p>of law V order by using a 17-step pyramid—17 being a number with virtually
no interesting geometric, arithmetic or mystic properties, outside of Java,
where it was the basis of a particularly wierd musical scale—and topping it
with the Apple of Discord, symbol of the un-rational, un-geometrical, and
thoroughly disorderly spontaneity of the vegetable world of creative evolution.
The Erisian Liberation Front (ELF) had no symbol, and when asked for one by new
recruits, replied loftily that their symbol could not be pictured, since it was
a circle whose circumference was everywhere and its center nowhere. They were
the most far-out group of all, and only the most advanced Discordians could
begin to understand their gibberish.</p>
<p>The JAMs, however, had a symbol that anyone could understand, and, just as
Harry Pierpont showed it to John Dillinger midway through a nutmeg high in
Michigan City prison, Dr. Ignotius showed it to Joe midway through his first
acid trip.</p>
<p>&quot;This,&quot; he said dramatically, &quot;is the Sacred Chao.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a symbol of technocracy,&quot; Joe said, giggling.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Dr. Ignotius smiled, &quot;at least you're original. Nine
out of ten new members mistake it for the Chinese yin-yang or the astrological
symbol of Cancer. It's similar to both of them—and also to the symbols of the
Northern Pacific Railroad and the Sex Information and Education Council of the
United States, all of which is eventually going to lead to some interesting
documents being produced at John Birch headquarters, I'm sure, proving that sex
educators run the railroads or that astrologers control the sex educators or
something of that sort. No, this is different. It is the Sacred Chao, symbol of
Mummu, God of Chaos.</p>
<p>&quot;On the right, O nobly born, you will see the image of your 'female' and
intuitive nature, called <i>yin </i>by the Chinese. The yin contains an apple
which is the golden ap-</p>
<p>pie of Eris, the forbidden apple of Eve, and the apple which used to
disappear from the stage of the Flatbush Burlesque House in Brooklyn when Linda
Larue did the split on top of it at the climax of her striptease. It represents
the erotic, libidinal, anarchistic, and subjective values worshiped by Hagbard
Celine and our friends in the Legion of Dynamic Discord.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, O nobly born, as you prepare for Total Awakening, turn your eyes
to the left, yang side of the Sacred Chao. This is the image of your 'male,'
rationalistic ego. It contains the pentagon of the Illuminati, the Satanists,
and the U.S. Army. It represents the anal, authoritarian, structural, law 'n'
order values which the Illuminati have imposed, through their puppet
governments, on most of the peoples of the world.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what you must understand, O newborn Buddha: neither side is
complete, or true, or real. Each is an abstraction, a fallacy. Nature is a
seamless web in which both sides are in perpetual war (which is another name for
perpetual peace). The equation always balances. Increase one side, and the other
side increases by itself. Every homosexual is a latent heterosexual, every
authoritarian cop is the shell over an anarchistic libido. There is no <i>Vernichtung,
</i>no Final Solution, no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and you are not
Saul Goodman, when you're lost out here.&quot;</p>
<p>Listen: the chaos you experience under LSD is not an illusion. The orderly
world you <i>imagine you experience, </i>under the artificial and poisonous diet
which the Illuminati have forced on all civilized nations, is the real illusion.
I am not saying what you are hearing. The only good fnord is a dead fnord. Never
whistle while you're pissing. An obscure but highly significant contribution to
sociology and epistemology occurs in Malignowski's study &quot;Retroactive
Reality,&quot; printed in <i>Wieczny Kwiat Wtadza, </i>the journal of the Polish
Orthopsychiatric Psociety, for Autumn 1959.</p>
<p>&quot;All affirmations are true in some sense, false in some sense,
meaningless in some sense, true and false in some sense, true and meaningless in
some sense, false and meaningless in some sense, and true and false and
meaningless in some sense. Do you follow me?&quot;</p>
<p><i>(In some sense, </i>Joe mutters. . . .)</p>
<p>The author, Dr. Malignowski, was assisted by three graduate students named
Korzybski-1, Korzybski-2, and Korzybski-3 (Siamese triplets born to a
mathematician and, hence, indexed rather than named). Malignowski and his
students interviewed 1,700 married couples, questioning husband and wife
separately in each case, and asked 100 key questions about their first meeting,
first sexual experience, marriage ceremony, honeymoon, economic standing during
the first year of marriage, and similar subjects which should have left
permanent impressions on the memory. Not one couple in the 1,700 gave exactly
the same answers to 100 questions, and the highest single score was made by a
couple who gave the same answers to 43 of the questions.</p>
<p>&quot;This study demonstrated graphically what many psychologists have long
suspected: the life-history which most of us carry around in our skulls is more
our own creation (at least seven percent more) than it is an accurate recording
of realities. As Malignowski concludes, 'Reality is retroactive, retrospective
and illusory.'</p>
<p>&quot;Under these circumstances, things not personally experienced but
recounted by others are even more likely to be distorted, and after a tale
passes through five tellers it is virtually one hundred percent pure myth:
another example of the Law of Fives.</p>
<p>&quot;Only Marxists,&quot; Dr. Iggy concluded, opening the door to usher Joe
into the chapel room, &quot;still believe in an objective history. Marxists and
a few disciples of Ayn Rand.&quot;</p>
<p>Jung took the parchment from Drake and stared at it &quot;It's not to be
signed in blood? And what the hell is this yin-yang symbol with the pentagon and
the apple? You're a fucking fake.&quot; His lips curled tightly in against his
teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; said George through a throat that was rapidly
closing up.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean you're not from the goddam Illuminati,&quot; said Jung.
&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't you know that before I came here—-that I'm not from the
Illuminati?&quot; said George. &quot;I'm not trying to fake anybody out. Honest,
really, I thought you knew the people who sent me. I never <i>said I </i>was
from the Illuminati.&quot;</p>
<p>Maldonado nodded, a slight smile bringing his face to life. &quot;I know who
he is. The people of the Old <i>Strega. </i>The Sybil of Sybils. All hail
Discordia, kid. Right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hail Eris,&quot; said George with a slight feeling of relief.</p>
<p>Drake frowned. &quot;Well, we seem to be at cross purposes. We were contacted
by mail, then by telephone, then by messenger, by parties who made it quite
clear that they knew all about our business with the Illuminati. Now, to the
best of my knowledge—perhaps Don Federico knows better—there is only one
organization in the world that knows anything about the AISB, and that is the
AISB itself.&quot; George could tell he was lying.</p>
<p>Maldonado raised a warning hand. &quot;Wait. Up, everybody. To the
bathroom.&quot;</p>
<p>Drake sighed. &quot;Oh, Don Federico! You and your tired notions of security.
If my house isn't safe, we're all dead men as of this moment. And if the AISB is
as good as it's said to be, an old trick like running water will be no obstacle
to them. Let's conduct this discussion like civilized men, for God's sake, and <i>not
</i>huddled around my shower stall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are times when dignity is suicide,&quot; said Maldonado. He
shrugged. &quot;But, I yield. I'll settle the question with you in hell if
you're wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm still in the dark,&quot; said Richard Jung. &quot;I don't know who
this guy is or where he's from.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look, Chinaman,&quot; said Maldonado. &quot;You know who the Ancient
Illuminated Seers of Bavaria are, right? Well, every organization has
opposition, right? So do the Illuminati. Opposition that's like them, religious,
magical, spooky stuff. Not simply interested in becoming rich, as is our
gentlemanly aim in life. Playing supernatural games. <i>Capeesh?&quot;</i></p>
<p>Jung looked skeptical. &quot;You could be describing the Communist party, the
CIA, or the Vatican.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Superficial,&quot; said Maldonado scornfully. &quot;And upstarts,
compared with the AISB. Because the Bavarian Illuminati aren't Bavarians, you
understand. That's just a recent name and manifestation for their order. Both
the Illuminati and their opposition, which this guy represents, go back a long
ways before Moscow, Washington or Rome. A little imagination is called for to
understand this, Chinaman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the Illuminati are yang,&quot; George said helpfully, &quot;we're
yin. The only solution is a Yin Revolution. Dig?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am a graduate of Harvard Law School,&quot; said Jung loftily,
&quot;and I do <i>not </i>dig it. What are you, a bunch of hippies?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We never made a deal with your bunch before,&quot; said Maldonado.
&quot;They never had enough to offer us.&quot;</p>
<p>Robert Putney Drake said, &quot;Yes, but wouldn't you <i>like </i>to, though,
Don Federico? Haven't you had a bellyfull of the others? I know I have. I know
where you're from now, George. And you people have been making giant strides in
recent decades. I'm not surprised that you're able to tempt us. It's worth our
lives—and we are supposedly the most secure men in the United States—to
betray the Illuminati. But I understand you offer us statues from Atlantis. By
now they should be uncrated. And that there are more where these came from? Is
that right, George?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard had said nothing about that, but George was too worried about his own
survival to quibble. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;There are more.&quot;</p>
<p>Drake said, &quot;Whether we want to risk our lives by working with your
people will depend on what we find when we examine the <i>objets d'art </i>you
are offering. Don Federico, being a highly qualified expert in antiquities,
particularly in those antiquities which have been carefully kept outside of the
ken of conventional archaeological knowledge, will pronounce on the value of
what you've brought. As a Sicilian thoroughly versed in his heritage, Don
Federico is familiar with things Atlantean. The Sicilians are about the only
extant people who do know about Atlantis. It is not generally realized that the
Sicilians have the oldest continuous civilization on the face of the planet.
With all due respects to the Chinese.&quot; Drake nodded formally to Jung.</p>
<p>&quot;I consider myself an American,&quot; said Jung. &quot;Though my family
knows a thing or two about Tibet that might surprise you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure,&quot; said Drake. &quot;Well, you shall advise, as you are
able. But the Sicilian heritage goes back thousands of years before Rome, as
does their knowledge of Atlantis. There were a few things washed up on the
shores of North Africa, a few things found by divers. It was enough to establish
a tradition. If there were a museum of Atlantean arts, Don Federico is one of
the few people in the world qualified to be a curator.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In other words,&quot; said Maldonado with a ghastly smile, &quot;those
statues better be authentic, kid. Because I will know if they are not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are,&quot; said George. &quot;I saw them picked up off the ocean
bottom myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's impossible,&quot; said Jung.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's look,&quot; said Drake.</p>
<p>He stood up and placed the palm of his hand flat against an oak panel which
immediately slid to one side, revealing a winding metal staircase. Drake leading
the way, the four of them descended what seemed to George five stories to a door
with a combination lock. Drake opened the door and they passed through a series
of other chambers, ending up in a large underground garage. The Gold &amp; Appel
truck was there and beside it the four statues, freed of their crates. There was
no one in the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Where did everybody go?&quot; said Jung.</p>
<p>&quot;They're Sicilians,&quot; said Drake. &quot;They saw these and were
afraid. They did the job of uncrating them and left.&quot; His face and
Maldonado's wore a look of awe. Jung's craggy features bore an irritated,
puzzled frown.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm beginning to feel that I've been left out of a lot,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Later,&quot; said Maldonado. He took a small jeweler's glass out of his
pocket and approached the nearest statue. &quot;This is where they got the idea
for the great god Pan,&quot; he said. &quot;But you can see the idea was more
complicated twenty thousand years ago than two thousand.&quot; Fixing the
jeweler's glass in his eye, he began a careful inspection of a glittering hoof.</p>
<p>At the end of an hour, Maldonado, with the help of a ladder, had gone over
each of the four statues from bottom to top with fanatical care and had
questioned George about the manner of their seizure as well as what little he
knew of their history. He put his jeweler's glass away, turned to Drake and
nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;You got the four most valuable pieces of art in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Drake nodded. &quot;I surmised as much. Worth more than all the gold in all
the Spanish treasure ships there ever were.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I have not been dosed with a hallucinogenic drug,&quot; said Richard
Jung, &quot;I gather you are all saying these statues come from Atlantis. I'll
take your word for it that they're solid gold, and that means there's a lot of
gold there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The value of the matter is not worth one one ten-thousandth the value
of the form,&quot; said Drake.</p>
<p>&quot;That I don't see,&quot; said Jung. &quot;What is the value of Atlantean
art if no reputable authority anywhere in the world believes in Atlantis?&quot;</p>
<p>Maldonado smiled. &quot;There are a few people in the world who know that
Atlantis existed, and who know there is such a thing as Atlantean art. And
believe me, Richard, those few got enough money to make it worth anyone's while
who has a piece from the bottom of the sea. Any one of these statues could buy a
middle-sized country.&quot;</p>
<p>Drake clapped his hands with an air of authority. &quot;I'm satisfied if Don
Federico is satisfied. For these and for four more like them—or the equivalent
if four such statues simply don't exist—my hand is joined with the hand of the
Discordian movement. Let us go back upstairs and sign the papers—in pen and
ink. And then, George, we would like you to be our guest at dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>George didn't know if he had the authority to promise four more statues, and
he was certain that total openness was the only safe approach with these men. As
they were climbing the stairs, he said to Drake, who was above him, &quot;I
wasn't authorized by the man who sent me to promise anything more. And I don't
believe he has any more at the moment, unless he has a collection of his own. I
know these four statues are the only ones he captured on this trip.&quot;</p>
<p>Drake let out a small fart, an incredible thing, it seemed to George, for the
leader of all organized crime in the United States to do. &quot;Excuse me,&quot;
he said. &quot;The exertion of these stairs is too much for me. Would love to
put in an elevator, but that wouldn't be as secure. One of these days my heart
will give out, going up and down those stairs.&quot; The fart smelled moderately
bad, and George was glad when he had climbed out of its neighborhood. He was
surprised that a man of Drake's importance would acknowledge that he farted.
Perhaps that kind of straightforwardness was a factor in Drake's success. George
doubted that Maldonado would admit to a fart. The Don was too devious. He was
not your earthy sort of Latin—he was paper-thin and paper-pale, like a Tuscan
aristocrat of attenuated bloodline.</p>
<p>They reentered Drake's office, and Drake and Maldonado each signed the
parchment scroll. After the phrase, &quot;for valuable considerations
received,&quot; Drake inserted the words, &quot;and considerations of equal
value yet to come.&quot;</p>
<p>He smiled at George. &quot;Since you can't guarantee the additional objects,
I'll expect to hear from your boss within twenty-four hours after you leave
here. This whole deal is contingent upon the additional payment from you.&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">ORGASM. HER BUBBIES FRITCHID BY THE GYNING

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All in a lewdercrass chaste for
a moulteeng fawkin. In fact, hearing Drake say that he was to be leaving the
Syndicate fortress made George feel a bit better. He signed in behalf of the
Discordians and Jung signed as a witness.</p>
<p>Drake said, &quot;You understand, there is no way the organizations which Don
Federico and I represent can be bound by anything we sign. What we agree to here
is to use our influence with our many esteemed colleagues and to hope that they
will grant us the favor of cooperation in the mutual enterprise.&quot;</p>
<p>Maldonado said, &quot;I couldn't have said it better myself. We, of course,
personally pledge our lives and our honor to further your purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>Robert Putney Drake took a cigar out of a<i> </i>silver humidor. Slapping
George on the back, he shoved the cigar into his mouth. &quot;You know, you're
the first hippie I've ever done business with. I suppose you'd like to have some
marijuana. I don't keep any around the house, and as you probably know we don't
deal much in the stuff. Too bulky to transport, considering the amount you can
make on it Aside from that, I think you'll like the food and drink here. We'll
have a big dinner and some entertainment.&quot;</p>
<p>The dinner was steak Diane, and it was served to the four men at a long table
in a dining room hung with large, old paintings. They were waited on by a series
of beautiful young women, and George wondered where the gang leaders kept their
wives and mistresses. In some sort of <i>pur-dah, </i>perhaps. There was
something Arabic about this whole setup.</p>
<p>During the main course a blonde in a long white gown which left one breast
bare played the harp in a corner of the room and sang. There was conversation
with the coffee; four young women sat down briefly with the men and regaled them
with witticisms and funny stories.</p>
<p>With the brandy came Tarantella Serpentine. She was an amazingly tall woman,
at least six feet two, with long blond hair that was piled high on her head and
fell below her shoulders. She was wearing tinkling gold bracelets around her
wrists and ankles, and there were diaphonous veils wrapped around her slender
body, and nothing else. George could see pink nipples and dark crotch hair. When
she strode through the door Banana-Nose Maldonado wiped his mouth with his
napkin and began applauding gleefully. Robert Putney Drake smiled proudly and
Richard Jung swallowed hard.</p>
<p>George just stared. &quot;The star of our little rural retreat,&quot; said
Drake by way of introduction. &quot;May I present—Miss Tarantella
Serpentine.&quot; Maldonado's applause continued, and George wondered if he
should join in. Music, Oriental but with a touch of rock, flooded the room. The
sound reproduction equipment was excellent, nigh perfect. Tarantella Serpentine
began to dance. It was a strange, hybrid sort of dance, a synthesis of
belly-dancing, go-go, and modern ballet. George licked his lips and he felt his
face get warm and his penis begin to throb and swell as he watched. Tarantella
Serpentine's dance was even more sensuous than the dance Stella Mans had done
when he was being initiated into the Discordian movement.</p>
<p>After she had done three dances, Tarantella bowed and left. &quot;You must be
tired, George,&quot; said Drake, resting his hand on George's shoulder.</p>
<p>Suddenly, George realized he had been going on almost no sleep except for the
times he'd dozed off in the car on the way from Mad Dog to the Gulf. He had been
under incredible physical, and even more important, emotional pressure.</p>
<p>He agreed that he was tired, and, praying that he would not be murdered in
his sleep, he let Drake lead him to a bedroom.</p>
<p>The bed was an enormous fourposter with a cloth-of-gold canopy. Naked, George
slid between cool, crisp sheets, and clutching the top sheet around his neck,
lay flat on his back, shut his eyes tight and sighed. That morning he had been
on a beach in the Gulf of Mexico watching naked Mavis masturbate. He had fucked
an apple. He had been to Atlantis. And now he was lying on a downy-soft mattress
in the home of the chief of all organised crime in America. If he closed his
eyes he might find himself back in the Mad Dog jail. He shook his head. There
was nothing to fear.</p>
<p>He heard the bedroom door open. There was nothing to fear. To prove it, he
kept his eyes closed. He heard a</p>
<p>board squeak. Squeaky boards in this place? Sure—to warn the sleeper that
there was someone sneaking up on him. He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Tarantella Serpentine was standing over the bed. &quot;Bobby-baby sent
me,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>George closed his eyes again. &quot;Sweetheart,&quot; he said, &quot;you are
beautiful. You really are. You're beautiful. Make yourself comfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>She reached down and turned on a bedside lamp. She was wearing a gold
metallic bikini top with a short matching skirt. Her breasts were delightfully
small, George thought. Although, on a five-foot-two girl they'd be ample. But
Tarentella was built like a <i>Vogue </i>model. George liked her looks. He had
always been partial to tall, slender boyish women.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not intruding on you, am I?&quot; she asked. &quot;You sure you
wouldn't rather sleep?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well it's not so much what Td <i>rather </i>do,&quot; said George.
&quot;I doubt that I can do anything other than sleep. I have had a very trying
day.&quot; Masturbated once, he thought, had one blow job, and fucked one apple.
Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Plus been scared out of my wits
90 percent of the time.</p>
<p>Tarantella said, &quot;My name is known in ratified circles for what I can
achieve with men whose days are <i>all </i>trying. Presidents, kings, Syndicate
heads—naturally—rock stars, oil billionnaires, people like that. My thing
is, I can make men come. Over and over and over and <i>over </i>again. Ten
times, sometimes even twenty times, no matter how old or how tired. I get paid a
lot. Tonight, Bobby-baby is paying for my services, and I'm to service you.
Which I like very much, because most of my clientele is on the middle-aged side,
and you're nice and young and have a firm body.&quot; She gently pulled the
sheet loose from George's grip—he had forgotten he was still holding it up
around his neck— and caressed his bare shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;How old are you, George—twenty-two?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty-three,&quot; said George. &quot;But I don't want to disappoint
you. I'm willing and I'm interested. In fact, I'm curious about what you do. But
I'm pretty tired.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Honey, you <i>can't </i>disappoint me. The more limp you are, the more
I like it. The more of a challenge you are to me. Let me show you my
specialty.&quot;</p>
<p>Tarantella doffed her bra, skirt, and panties quickly but deliberately enough
to let George enjoy watching her. Smiling at him, she stood before him, her legs
spread wide apart. Her fingernails tickled her nipples, and George watched them
swell up. Then, her left hand playing with her left breast, her right hand
snaked down to her groin and began massaging the golden-brown hairs of her mons.
Her middle finger disappeared between her legs. After a few moments a scarlet
flush spread over her face, neck, and chest, her body arched backward, and she
gave a single, agonized cry. Her skin, from head to toe, was glowing with a fine
coating of sweat.</p>
<p>After a momentary pause she smiled and looked at him. Her right hand caressed
his cheek and he felt the wetness on his face and smelled the Lobster Newburg
aroma of a young cunt. Her fingers drifted to the sheets, and with a sudden
movement she stripped them away from George's body. She grinned down at his
stiff cock and in a moment was on top of him, holding his prick, inserting it
into herself. Two minutes of smooth pistonlike movements on her part brought him
to an unexpectedly pleasant orgasm.</p>
<p>&quot;Baby,&quot; he said. &quot;You could wake the dead.&quot;</p>
<p>He enjoyed his second orgasm about a half hour later, and his third a half
hour after that. The second time Tarantella lay on her back and George lay on
top of her, and the third time she was on her stomach and he was straddling her
from the rear. There was something about the mood Tarantella created that was
crucial to what she called her &quot;specialty.&quot; Though she had boasted
about her ability to make a man come repeatedly, when it came right down to
doing things she made him feel that it didn't really matter what happened with
him. She was fun-loving, playful, carefree. He did not feel obligated in any
sense to stiffen, to come. Tarantella might view men as a challenge, but she
made it clear that George was not to see her as a challenge.</p>
<p>After a short nap, he woke to find her sucking his rapidly hardening penis.
It took much longer this time for him to come, but he enjoyed every second of
mounting pleasure. After that they lay side by side and talked for a while. Then
Tarantella went to the bedside table and took a tube of petroleum jelly out of a
drawer. She began applying it to his penis, which grew erect during the process.
Then she rolled over and presented him with her rosy asshole. It was the first
time George had had a woman that way, and he came rather quickly after insertion
from the novelty and excitement of it all.</p>
<p>They slept for a while and he awoke to find her masturbating him. Her fingers
were very clever and seemed quickly to find their way to all the most sensitive
parts of his penis—with special attention to that area just behind the crown
of the head. He opened his eyes wide when he came and saw, after a few seconds,
a small, pale, pearl-like drop of semen appear on the end of his dick. A wonder
there was any at all.</p>
<p>It was getting to be a trip. His ego went away somewhere, and he was all
body, letting it all happen. <i>It</i> was fucking Tarantella, and <i>it </i>was
coming—and, judging by the sounds she was making and the wetness in which his
penis was sloshing, she was coming, too.</p>
<p>There followed two more blow jobs. Then Tarantella pulled something that
looked like an electric razor out of the bed-table drawer. She plugged it into
the wall and began to stroke his penis with its vibrating head, pausing every so
often to lick and lubricate the areas she was working on.</p>
<p>George closed his eyes and rolled his hips from side to side as he felt yet
another orgasm coming on. From a great distance he heard Tarantella Serpentine
say, &quot;My greatness lies in the life I can generate in limp pricks.&quot;</p>
<p>George's pelvis began to pump up and down. It was really going to be that
superorgasm Hemingway described. It began to happen. It was pure electricity. No
juice—all energy pouring out like lightning through the magic wand at the
center of his being. He wouldn't be surprised to discover that his balls and
cock were disintegrating into whirling electrons. He screamed, and behind his
tight-clenched eyes, he saw, very clearly, the smiling, face of Mavis.</p>
<p>He awoke in the dark, and his instinctive groping motion told him that
Tarantella was gone.</p>
<p>Instead, Mavis, in a white doctor's smock, stood at the foot of the bed,
watching him with large bright eyes. The darkened Drake bedroom had turned into
a hospital ward, and was suddenly brightly lit.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you get here?&quot; he blurted. &quot;I mean—how did I get
here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Saul,&quot; she said kindly, &quot;it's almost all over. You've come
through it.&quot;</p>
<p>And suddenly he realized that he felt, not twenty-three, but sixty-three
years old.</p>
<p>&quot;You've won,&quot; he admitted, &quot;I'm no longer sure who I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've won,&quot; Mavis contradicted. &quot;You've gone through ego
loss and now you're beginning to discover who you really are, poor old
Saul.&quot;</p>
<p>He examined his hands: old man's. Wrinkled. Good-man's hands.</p>
<p>&quot;There are two forms of ego loss,&quot; Mavis went on, &quot;and the
Illuminati are masters of both. One is schizophrenia, the other is illumination.
They set you on the first track, and we switched you to the other. You had a
time bomb in your head, but we defused it.&quot;</p>
<p>Malik's apartment. The Playboy Club. The submarine. And all the other past
lives and lost years. &quot;By God,&quot; Saul Goodman cried, &quot;I've got it.
I <i>am </i>Saul Goodman, but I am all the other people, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And all time is this time,&quot; Mavis added softly.</p>
<p>Saul sat upright, tears gleaming in his eyes. &quot;I've killed men. I've
sent them to the electric chair. Seventeen times. Seventeen suicides. The
savages who cut off fingers or toes or ears for their gods are more sensible. We
cut off whole egos, thinking they are not ourselves but separate. God God
God,&quot; and he burst in sobs.</p>
<p>Mavis rushed forward and held him, cradling his head to her breast. &quot;Let
it out,&quot; she said. &quot;Let it all out. It's not true unless it makes you
laugh, but you don't understand until it makes you weep.&quot;</p>
<p>QUEENS. Psychoanalysts <i>in </i>living cells, moving in military ordure, and
a shitty outlook on life and sex, dancing coins in harry's krishna. It all
coheres, even if you approach it bass ackwards. It coheres.</p>
<p>&quot;Gruad the grayface!&quot; Saul screamed, weeping, beating his fist
against the pillow as Mavis held his head, stroked his hair. &quot;Gruad the
damned! And I have been his servant, his puppet, sacrificing myselves on his
electric altars as burnt offerings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Mavis cooed in his ear. &quot;We must learn to give up
our sacrifices, not our joys. They have taught us to give up everything except
our sacrifices, and those are what we must give up. We must sacrifice our
sacrifices.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Grayface, the lifehater!&quot; Saul shrieked. &quot;The bastard
motherfucker! Osiris, Quetzalcoatl, I know him</p>
<p>under all his aliases. Grayface, Grayface, Grayface! I know his wars and his
prisons, the young boys he shafts up the ass, the George Dorns he tries to turn
into killers like himself. And I have served him all my life. I have sacrificed
men on his bloody pyramid!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let it out,&quot; Mavis repeated, holding the old man's trembling body
&quot;Let it all out, baby. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>NOTHUNG. Woden you gnaw it, when you herd those flying sheeps with Wagner's
loopy howls? Hassan walked this loony valley, he had to wake up by himself.
August 23, 1966: before he ever heard of the SSS, the Discordians, the JAMs or
the Illuminati: stoned and beatific, Simon Moon is browsing in a Consumer
Discount store on North Clark street, digging the colors, not really intending
to buy anything. He stops in a frieze, mesmerized by a sign above the timeclock:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">NO EMPLOYEE MAY, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,
PUNCH</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THE TIME CARD FOR ANY OTHER EMPLOYEE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">ANY DEVIATION WILL RESULT IN TERMINATION.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THE MGT.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;God's pajamas,&quot; Simon mutters, incredulous.</p>
<p>&quot;Pajamas? Aisle seven,&quot; a clerk says helpfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Thanks,&quot; Simon speaks very distinctly, edging away, hiding
his high. God's <i>pajamas and spats, </i>he thinks in a half-illuminated
trance, either I'm more stoned than I think or that sign is absolutely the whole
clue to how the show runs.</p>
<p>RAGS. Hail Ghoulumbia, her monadmen are fled and all she's left now is a
bloody period. &quot;The funny part,&quot; Saul said, smiling while a few tears
still flowed, &quot;is that I'm not ashamed of this. Two days ago I would have
rather died than be seen weeping—especially by a woman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Mavis said, <i>&quot;especially by a woman.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;That's it—isn't it?&quot; Saul gasped. 'That's their whole gimmick. I
couldn't see you without seeing a <i>woman. </i>I couldn't see that editor,
Jackson, without seeing a <i>Negro. I </i>couldn't see anybody without seeing
the attached label and classification.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's how they keep us apart,&quot; Mavis said gently. &quot;And
that's how they train us to keep our masks on. Love was the hardest bond for
them to smash, so they had to create patriarchy, male supremacy, and all that
crap—and the 'masculine protest' and 'penis envy&quot; in women came in as a
result—so even lovers couldn't look at one another without seeing a separate
category.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O my God, my God,&quot; Saul moaned, beginning to weep heavily again.
&quot; 'A rag, a bone, a hank of hair.' O my God. <i>And you were with
them!&quot; </i>he cried suddenly, raising his head. &quot;You're a former
Illuminatus—that's why you're so important to Hagbard's plan. And that's why
you have that tattoo!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was one of the Five who run the U.S.,&quot; Mavis nodded. &quot;One
of the Insiders, as Robert Welch calls them. I've been replaced now by Atlanta
Hope, the leader of God's Lightning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've got it, I've got it!&quot; Saul said, laughing, &quot;I looked
every way but the right way before. <i>He's </i>inside the Pentagon. That's why
they build it in that shape, so <i>he </i>couldn't escape. The Aztecs, the Nazis
. . . and now us ...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Mavis said grimly. &quot;That's why thirty thousand
Americans disappear every year, without trace, and their cases end up in the
unsolved files. <i>He </i>has to be fed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; 'A man, though naked, may be in rags.&quot; &quot; Saul quoted.
&quot;Ambrose Bierce knew about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Arthur Machen,&quot; Mavis added. &quot;And Lovecraft. But they had
to write in code. Even so, Lovecraft went too far, mentioning the <i>Necronomicon
</i>by name. That's why he died so suddenly when he was only forty-seven. And
his literary executor, August Derleth, was persuaded to insert a note in every
edition of Lovecraft's works, claiming that the <i>Necronomicon </i>doesn't
exist and was just part of Lovecraft's fantasy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the <i>Lloigor?&quot; </i>Saul asked. &quot;And the <i>dols?&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Real,&quot; Mavis said. &quot;All real. That's what causes bad acid
trips and schizophrenia. Psychic contact with <i>them </i>when the ego wall
breaks. That's where the Illuminati were sending you when we raided their fake
Playboy Club and short-circuited the process.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Du hexen Hase,&quot; </i>Saul quoted. And he began to tremble.</p>
<p>UNHEIMLICH. Urvater whose art's uneven, horrid be thine aim. Harpoons in him,
corpus whalem: take ye and hate.</p>
<p>Fernando Poo was given prominent attention in the world press only once
before the notorious Fernando Poo Incident. It occurred in the early 1970s
(while Captain Tequilla y Mota was first studying the art of the Coup d'Etat and
laying his first plans,) and was occasioned by the outrageous claims of the
anthropologist J. N. Marsh, of Miskatonic University, that artifacts he had
found on Fernando Poo proved the existence of the lost continent of Atlantis.
Although Professor Marsh had an impeccable reputation for scholarly caution and
scientific rigor before this, his last published book, <i>Atlantis and Its Gods,
</i>was greeted with mockery and derision by his professional colleagues,
especially after his theories were picked up and sensationalized by the press.
Many of the old man's friends, in fact, blame this campaign of ridicule for his
disappearance a few months later, which they suspect was the suicide of a
broken-hearted and sincere searcher after truth.</p>
<p>Not only were Marsh's theories now beyond all scientific credibility, but his
methods—such as quoting Allegro's <i>The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross </i>or
Graves' <i>The White Goddess </i>as if they were as reputable as Boas, Mead, or
Frazer—seemed to indicate senility. This impression was increased by the
eccentric dedication &quot;To Ezra Pound, Jacques De Molay and Emperor Norton
I.&quot; The real scientific scandal was not the theory of Atlantis (that was a
bee that had haunted many a scholarly bonnet) but Marsh's claim that the gods of
Atlantis actually existed; not as supernatural beings, of course, but as a
superior class of life, now extinct, which had preexisted mankind and duped the
earliest civilization into worshiping them as divine and offering terrible
sacrifices at their altars. That there was absolutely no archaeological or
paleontological evidence that such beings ever existed, was the mildest of the
scholarly criticisms aimed at this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Professor Marsh's rapid decline, in the few months between the book's
unanimous rejection by the learned world and his sudden disappearance, caused
great pain to colleagues at Miskatonic. Many recognized that he had acquired
some of his notions from Dr. Henry Armitage, generally regarded as having gone
somewhat bananas after too many years devoted to puzzling out the obscene
metaphysics of the <i>Necronomicon. </i>When the librarian Miss Horus mentioned
at a faculty tea shortly after the disappearance that Marsh had spent much of
the past month with that volume, one Catholic professor urged, only
half-jokingly, that Miskatonic should rid itself of scandals once and for all by
presenting &quot;that damned book&quot; (he emphasized the word very
deliberately) to Harvard.</p>
<p>Missing Persons Department of the Arkham police assigned the Marsh case to a
young detective who had previously distinguished himself by tracing several
missing infants to one of the particularly vile Satanist cults that have
festered in that town since the witch-hunting days of 1692. His first act was to
examine the manuscript on which the old man had been working since the
completion of <i>&quot;Atlantis and Its Gods.&quot; </i>It seemed to be a
shortish essay, intended for an anthropological magazine, and was quite
conservative in tone and concept, as if the professor regretted the boldness of
his previous speculations. Only one footnote, expressing guarded and qualified
endorsement of Urqhuart's theory about Wales being settled by survivors from Mu,
showed the bizarre preoccupations of the Atlantis book. However, the final sheet
was not related to this article at all and seemed to be notes for a piece which
the Professor evidently intended to submit, brazenly and in total contempt of
academic opinion, to a pulp publication devoted to flying saucers and occultism.
The detective puzzled over these notes for a long time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>The usual hoax: fiction presented as fact. This hoax described here
opposite to this: fact presented as fiction.</i></p>
<p><i>Huysmans' La-Bas started it, turns the Satanist into hero.</i></p>
<p><i>Machen in Paris 1880s, met with Huysman's circle.</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Dols&quot; and &quot;Aklo letters&quot; in Machen's subsequent
&quot;fiction.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>Same years: Bierce and Chambers both mention Lake of Hali and Carcosa.
Allegedly, coincidence.</i></p>
<p><i>Crowley recruiting his occult circle after 1900.</i></p>
<p><i>Bierce disappears in 1913.</i></p>
<p><i>Lovecraft introduces Halt, dols, Aklo, Cthulhu after 1923.</i></p>
<p><i>Lovecraft dies unexpectedly, 1937.</i></p>
<p><i>Seabrook discusses Crowley, Machen, etc. in his &quot;Witchcraft,&quot;
1940.</i></p>
<p><i>Seabrook's &quot;suicide,&quot; 1942.</i></p>
<p><i>Emphasize: Bierce describes Oedipus Complex in &quot;Death of Halpin
Frazer,&quot; BEFORE Freud, and</i></p>
<p><i>relativity in &quot;Inhabitant of Carcosa,&quot; BEFORE Einstein.
Lovecraft's ambiguous descriptions of Azathoth as &quot;blind idiot-god,&quot;
&quot;Demon-Sultan&quot; and &quot;nuclear chaos&quot; circa 1930: fifteen years
before Hiroshima.</i></p>
<p><i>Direct drug references in Chambers' &quot;King in Yellow,&quot; Machen's
'White Powder,&quot; Lovecraffs &quot;Beyond the Wall of Sleep&quot; and
&quot;Mountains of Mad~ ness.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>The appetites of the Lloigor or Old Ones in Bierce's &quot;Damned
Thing.&quot; Machen's &quot;Black Stone,&quot; Love-craft (constantly.)</i></p>
<p><i>Atlantis known as Thule both in German and Panama Indian lore, and of
course, &quot;coincidence&quot; again the accepted explanation. Opening sentence
for article: &quot;The more frequently one uses the word 'coincidence' to
explain bizarre happenings, the more obvious it becomes that one is not seeking,
but evading, the real explanation.&quot; Or, shorter: &quot;The belief in
coincidence is the prevalent superstition of the Age of Science.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detective then spent an afternoon at Miskatonic library, browsing through
the writings of Ambrose Bierce, J-K Huysmans, Arthur Machen, Robert W. Chambers,
and H. P. Lovecraft. He found that all repeated certain key words; dealt with
lost continents or lost cities; described superhuman beings trying to misuse or
victimize mankind in some unspecified manner; suggested that there was a cult,
or group of cults, among mankind who served these beings; and described certain
books (usually not giving their titles: Lovecraft was an exception) that reveal
the secrets of these beings. With a little further research, he found that the
occult and Satanist circles in Paris in the 1880s had influenced the fiction of
both Huysmans and Machen, as well as the career of the egregious Aleistair
Crowley, and that Seabrook (who knew Crowley) hinted at more than he stated
outright in his book on Witchcraft, published two years before his suicide. He
then wrote a little table:</p>
<p><i>Huysmans—hysteria, complaints about occult attacks, final seclusion in a
monastery.</i></p>
<p><i>Chambers—abandons such subjects, turns to light romantic fiction.</i></p>
<p><i>Bierce—disappears mysteriously. Lovecraft—dead at an early age.
Crowley—hounded into silence and obscurity. Machen—becomes a devout
Catholic. (Huysmans' escape?) Seabrook—alleged suicide.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detective then went back and reread, not skimming this time, the stories
by these writers in which drugs were specifically mentioned, according to
Marsh's notes. He now had a hypothesis: the old man had been lured into a drug
cult, as had these writers, and had been terrified by his own hallucinations,
finally ending his own life to escape the phantoms his own narcotic-fogged brain
had created. It was a good enough theory to start with, and the detective
conscientiously set about interviewing every friend on campus of old Marsh,
leading into the subject of grass and LSD very slowly and indirectly. He made no
headway and was beginning to lose his conviction when good fortune struck, in
the form of a remark by another anthropology professor about Marsh's
preoccupation in recent years with <i>amanita muscaria, </i>the hallucinogenic
mushroom used in ancient Near Eastern religions.</p>
<p>&quot;A very interesting fungus, <i>amanita,&quot; </i>this professor told
the detective. &quot;Some sensationalists without scholarly caution have claimed
it was every magic potion in ancient lore: the soma of the Hindus, the sacrament
used in the Dionysian and Eleusinian mysteries in Greece, even the Holy
Communion of the earliest Christians and Gnostics. One chap in England even
claims amanita, and not hashish, was the drug used by the Assassins in the
Middle Ages, and there's a psychiatrist in New York, Puharich, who claims it
actually does induce telepathy. Most of that is rubbish, of course, but amanita
certainly is the strongest mind-altering drug in the world. If the kids ever
latch onto it, LSD will seem like a tempest in a teapot by comparison.&quot;</p>
<p>The detective now concentrated on finding somebody— anybody—who had
actually seen old Marsh when he was stoned out of his gourd. The testimony
finally came from a young black student named Pearson, who was majoring in
anthropology and minoring in music. &quot;Excited and euphoric? Yeah,&quot; he
said thoughtfully. &quot;I saw old Joshua that way once. It was in the library
of all places—that's where my girl works—and the old man jumped up from a
table grinning about a yard wide and said out loud, but talking to himself, you
know, 'I saw them—I saw the fnords!' Then he ran out like Jesse Owens going to
get his ashes hauled. I was curious and went over to peek at what he'd been
reading. It was the <i>New York Times </i>editorial page, and not a picture on
it, so he certainly didn't see the fnords, whatever the hell they are, <i>there.
</i>You think he was maybe bombed a little?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe, maybe not,&quot; the detective said noncomittally, obeying the
police rule of never accusing anyone of anything in hearing of a witness unless
ready to make an arrest. But he was already quite sure that Professor Marsh
would never reappear to be subject to arrest or any other harassment by those
who had not entered his special world of lost civilizations, vanished cities,
lloigors, dols, and fnords. To this day, the file on the Joshua N. Marsh case in
the Arkham police department bears the closing line: &quot;Probable cause of
death: suicide during drug psychosis.&quot; Nobody ever traced the change in
Professor Marsh back to a KCUF meeting in Chicago and a strangely spiked punch;
but the young detective, Daniel Pricefixer, always retained a nagging doubt and
a shapeless disquiet about this particular investigation, and even after he
moved to New York and went to work for Barney Muldoon, he was still addicted to
reading books on pre-history and thinking strange thoughts.</p>
<p>SIMON MAGUS. You will come to know gods.</p>
<p>After the disappearance of Saul Goodman and Barney Muldoon, the FBI went over
the Malik apartment with a fine-tooth comb. Everything was photographed,
fingerprinted, analyzed, catalogued, and where possible shipped back to the
crime laboratory in Washington. Among the items was a short note on the back of
a Playboy Club lunch receipt, not in Malik's handwriting, which meant nothing to
anybody and was included only for the sake of the completeness so loved by the
Bureau.</p>
<p>The note said: &quot;Machen's <i>dols = </i>Lovecraft's <i>dholes?&quot;</i></p>
<p>VECTORS. You will come to no gods.</p>
<p>On April 25, most of New York was talking about the incredible event that had
occurred shortly before dawn at the Long Island mansion of the nation's
best-known philanthropist, Robert Putney Drake. Danny Pricefixer of the Bomb
Squad, however, was almost oblivious of this bizarre occurrence, as he drove
through heavy traffic from one part of Manhattan to another interviewing every
witness who might have spoken to Joseph Malik in the week before the <i>Confrontation
</i>explosion. The results were uniformly disappointing: aside from the fact
that Malik had grown increasingly secretive in recent years, none of the
interviews seemed to provide any useful information. A killer smog had again
settled on the city, for the seventh straight day, and Danny, a nonsmoker, was
very aware of the wheeze in his chest, which did nothing to improve his mood.</p>
<p>Finally, at three in the afternoon, he left the office of ORGASM at 110 West
Fortieth Street (an associate editor there was an old friend of Malik's and
frequently lunched with him, but had nothing substantial to offer in leads) and
remembered that the main branch of the New York Public Library was only half a
block away. The hunch had been in the back of bis mind, he realized, ever since
he glanced at Malik's weird Illuminati memos. <i>What the hell, </i>he thought, <i>it'll
only be a few more wasted minutes in a wasted day.</i></p>
<p>For once, the congestion at the window in the main reference room was not
quite as bad as a Canal Street traffic jam. <i>Atlantis and Its Gods </i>by
Professor J. N. Marsh was delivered to him in seventeen minutes, and he began
leafing through it looking for the passage he vaguely remembered. At last, on
page 123, he found it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hans Stefan Santesson points out the basic similarity of Mayan and Egyptian
investiture rituals, as previously indicated in Colonel Churchward's insightful
but wrongheaded books on the lost continent of Mu. As we have demonstrated,
Churchward's obsession with the Pacific, based on his having received his first
clues about our lost ancestors in an Asiatic temple, led him to attribute to the
fictitious Mu much of the real history of the actual Atlantis. But this passage
from Santesson's <i>Understanding Mu </i>(Paperback Library, New York, 1970,
page 117) needs little correction:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next he was taken to the Throne of Regeneration of the Soul, and the Ceremony
of Investiture or Illumination took place. Then he experienced further ordeals
before attaining to the Chamber of the Orient, to the Throne of Ra, to become
truly a Master. He could see for himself in the distance the uncreated light
from which was pointed out the whole happiness of the future ... In other words,
as Churchward puts it, both in Egypt and in Maya the initiate had to
&quot;sustain&quot; (i.e., survive) &quot;the fiery ordeal&quot; to be approved
as an adept. The adept had to become justified. The justified must then become
illuminate. . . . The destruction of Mu was commemorated by the possibly
symbolic House of Fire of the Quiche Mayas and by the relatively later Chamber
of Central Fire of the Mysteries which we are told were celebrated in the Great
Pyramid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Substituting Atlantis for Mu, Churchward and Santesson are basically correct.
The god, of course, could choose the shape in which He would appear in the final
ordeal, and, since these gods, or <i>lloigor </i>in the Atlantean language,
possessed telepathy, they would read the initiate's mind and manifest in the
form most terrifying to the specific individual, although the <i>shog-goth </i>form
and the classic Angry Giant form such as appears in Aztec statues of Tlaloc were
most common. To employ an amusing conceit, if these beings had survived to our
time, as some occultists claim, they would appear to the average American as,
say, King Kong or, perhaps, Dracula or the Wolf-Man.</p>
<p>The sacrifices demanded by these creatures evidently contributed
significantly to the fall of Atlantis, and we can conjecture that the mass
burnings practised by the Celts at Beltain and even the Aztec religion, which
turned their altars into abbatoirs, were minor in comparison, being merely the
result of persistent tradition after the real menace of the <i>lloigor </i>had
vanished. We, of course, cannot fully understand the purpose of these bloody
rituals, since we cannot fathom the nature, or even the sort of matter or
energy, that comprised the <i>lloigor. </i>That the chief of these beings, is
known in the <i>Pnakotic Manuscripts </i>and the Eltdown Shards as lok-Sotot,
&quot;Eater of Souls,&quot; suggests that it was some energy or psychic
vibration of the dying victim that the <i>lloigor </i>needed; the physical body
was, as in the case of the corpse-eating cult of Leng, consumed by the priests
themselves, or merely thrown away, as among the Thuggee of India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thoughtfully and quietly, Danny Pricefixer returned the book to the clerk at
the checkout window. Thoughtfully and quietly, he walked out on Fifth Avenue and
stood between the two guardian lions. Who was it, he wondered, who had asked,
&quot;Since nobody wants war, why do wars keep happening?&quot; He looked at the
killer smog around him and asked himself another riddle, &quot;Since nobody
wants air pollution, why does air pollution keep increasing?&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Marsh's words came back to him: &quot;<i>if</i> <i>these beings had
survived to our time, as some occultists claim....&quot;</i></p>
<p>Walking toward his car, he passed a newsstand and saw that the disaster at
the Drake Mansion was still the biggest headline even in the afternoon editions.
It was irrelevant to his problem, however, so he ignored it.</p>
<p>Sherri Brandi continued the chant in her mind, maintaining the rhythm of her
mouth movements . . . <i>fifty-three-big rhinoceroses, fifty-four big
rhinoceroses, fifty-five—</i>Camel's nails dug into her shoulders suddenly and
the salty gush splashed hot on her tongue. Thank the Lord, she thought, the
bastard finally made it. Her jaw was tired and she had a crick in her neck and
her knees hurt, but at least the son-of-a-bitch would be in a good mood now and
wouldn't beat her up for having so little to report about Charley and his bugs.</p>
<p>She stood up, stretching her leg and neck muscles to remove the cramps, and
looked down to see if any of Car-mel's come had dribbled on her dress. Most men
wanted her naked during a blow job, but not creepy Carmel; he insisted she wear
her best gown, always. He liked soiling her, she realized; but, hell, he wasn't
as bad as some pimps and we've all got to get our kicks some way.</p>
<p>Carmel sprawled back in the easy chair, his eyes still closed. Sherri fetched
the towel she had been warming over the radiator and completed the transaction,
drying him and gently kissing his ugly wand before tucking it back inside his
fly and zippering him up. He <i>does </i>look like</p>
<p>if Rinehart could contact Aldous, he replied that Al-dous wanted to transmit
&quot;classical evidence of survival,&quot; a message, that is, which could not
be explained &quot;merely&quot; as telepathy, as something Rinehart picked out
of <i>her </i>mind. It had to be something that could only come from Aldous's
mind.</p>
<p>Later that evening, Rinehart produced it: instructions to go to a room in her
house, a room he hadn't seen and find a particular book, which neither he nor
she was familiar with. She was to look on a certain page and a certain line. The
book was one Aldous had read but she had never even glanced at; it was an
anthology of literary criticism. The line indicated—I have memorized it—was:
&quot;Aldous Huxley does not surprise us in this admirable communication in
which paradox and erudition in the poetic sense and the sense of humor are
interlaced in such an efficacious form.&quot; Need I add that the page was 17
and the line was, of course, line 23?</p>
<p>(I suppose you've read Seutonius and know that the late J. Caesar was
