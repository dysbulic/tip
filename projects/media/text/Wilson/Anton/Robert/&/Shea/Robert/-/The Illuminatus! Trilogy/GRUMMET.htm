<p>The bursts to the moon and to the planets are also not historic events. They
are the major evolutionary breakthroughs . . . Today when we speak of
immortality and of going to another world we no longer mean these in a
theological or metaphysical sense. People are now striving for physical
immortality. People are now traveling to other worlds. Transcendence is no
longer a metaphysical concept. It has become reality.</p>

<p>Ye have locked yerselves up in cages of fear; and, behold, do ye now complain
that ye lack freedom. —LORD OMAR KHAYYAM RAVENHURST, K.S.C.,</p>
<p>&quot;Epistle to the Paranoids,&quot;</p>

<p>As the earth turned on its axis and dawn reached city after city, hamlet
after hamlet, farm after farm, mountain and valley after mountain and valley, it
became obvious that May 1 would be bright and sunny almost everywhere. In Athens
a classical scholar waking in the small cell where certain Platonic opinions had
landed him felt a burst of unexpected hope and greeted Helios with rolling
syllables from Sappho, crying through the bars, <i>&quot;Brodadaktylos
Eos!&quot; </i>Birds, startled by the shout, took off from the jailyard below,
filling the air with the flapping of their wings; the guards came and told him
to shut up. He answered them gaily with <i>&quot;Polyphloisbois thalassas! </i>You've
taken everything else away from me, but you can't take old Homer away!&quot;</p>
<p>In Paris the Communists under the Red banner and the anarchists under the
Black were preparing for the annual International Labor Solidarity Day, at which
the usual factionalism and sectarianism would once again demonstrate the
absolute lack of international labor solidarity. And in London, Berlin, a
thousand cities, the Red and the Black would wave and the tongues of their
partisans would wag, and the age-old longing for a classless society would once
again manifest itself; while, in the same cities, an older name and an older
purpose for that day would be commemorated in convent after convent and school
after school where verses (far older than the name of Christianity) were sung to
the Mother of God:</p>
<p><i>Queen of the Angels Queen of the May</i></p>
<p>In the United States, alas, the usual celebrations of National Law Day had to
be cancelled, since the rioting was not quite ended yet.</p>
<p>But everywhere, in Asia and Africa as in Europe and the Americas, the members
of the Oldest Religion were returning from their festivals, murmuring
&quot;Blessed be&quot; as they parted, secure in their knowledge that the Mother
of God was indeed still alive and had visited them at midnight, whether they
knew her as Dian, Dan, Tan, Tana, Shakti, or even Erzulie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Queen of the Angels Queen of the May</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Nairobi, Nkrumah Fubar picked up his mail from a friend employed at the
post office. To his delight, American Express had relented and corrected their
error, crediting him with his February 2 payment at last. This was, to his
thinking, big magic, since the notification had been mailed from New York even
before he began his geodesic spiels against the President of American Express on
April 25. Obviously, such retroactive witchcraft was worthy of further
investigation, and the key was the synergetic geometry of the Fuller tetrahedron
in which he had kept his manikin during the spell-casting. Over breakfast,
before leaving for the university, he opened Fuller's <i>No More Second-Hand God
</i>and again grappled with the arcane mathematics and metaphysics of
omnidirectional halo. Finishing breakfast, he closed the book, shut his eyes,
and tried to visualize the Fuller universe. The image formed, and, to his
amazement and amusement, it was identical with certain symbols an old Kikuyu
witch doctor had once drawn when explaining the doctrine of &quot;fan-shaped
destiny&quot; to him.</p>
<p>As the book closed in Kenya, the drums of Orabi stopped abruptly. It was one
in the morning there, and the visiting anthropologist, Indole Ringh, immediately
asked how the dancers knew the ceremony was finished. &quot;The danger is
past,&quot; an old Hopi told him patiently, &quot;can't you <i>feel </i>the
difference in the air?&quot; (Saul, Barney, and Markoff Chaney were racing
toward Las Vegas in the rented Brontosaurus, while Dillinger was leisurely
driving back toward Los Angeles.) In Honolulu, as the clocks struck nine the
previous evening, Buckminster Fuller, trotting between airplanes, suddenly
caught a glimpse of a new geodesic structure fully incorporating omnidirectional
halo . . . And, after a four-hour flight eastward, landing in Tokyo at the
&quot;same time&quot; he left Honolulu, he had a detailed sketch finished (it
looked somewhat fan-shaped) as the NO SMOKING FASTEN SEAT BELT sign flashed. (It
was four A.M. in Los Angeles, and Dillinger, safely home—he thought—heard
the gunfire dying out in the distance. The President must already be withdrawing
the National Guard, at least in part, he thought.) The phone by Rebecca's bed
rang just then, eight o'clock New York time, and she answered it to hear Molly
Muldoon shout excitedly, &quot;Saul and Barney are on TV. Turn it on—they've
saved the country!&quot;</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, Barney blinked under the TV lights and stared woodenly into the
camera, while Saul kept his eyes on the interviewer and spoke in his
kindly-family-doctor persona.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you tell our viewers, Inspector Goodman, how you happened to be
looking in Lehman Caves for the missing man?&quot; The interviewer had the
professional tone of all TV newscasters; his intonation wouldn't have changed if
he'd been asking &quot;And why did you find our sponsor's product more
satisfactory?&quot; or &quot;How did you feel when you learned you had brain
cancer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Psychology,&quot; Saul pronounced gravely. &quot;The suspect was a
procurer. That's a definite psychological type, just as a safecracker, a bank
robber, a child molester, and a policeman are definite types. I tried to think
and feel like a procurer. What would such a man do with the whole government
looking for him? Attempt an escape to Mexico or somewhere else? Never—that's a
bank-robber reaction. Procurers are not people who take risks or make bold moves
against the odds. What would a procurer do? He would look for a hole to hide
in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The FBI crime lab definitely confirms that the man Inspector Goodman
found is the missing plague-carrier, Carmel,&quot; the interviewer threw in. (He
had orders to repeat this every two minutes.) &quot;Tell me, Inspector, why
wouldn't such a man hide in, say, an empty house, or a secluded cabin in the
mountains?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He wouldn't travel far,&quot; Saul explained. &quot;He'd be too
paranoid—seeing police officers everywhere he went. And his imagination would
vastly exaggerate the actual power of the government. There is only one law
enforcement agent to each four hundred citizens in this country, but he would
imagine the proportion reversed. The most secluded cabin would be too
nerve-wracking for him. He'd imagine hordes of National Guardsmen and law
officers of all sorts searching every square foot of woods in America. He really
would. Procurers are very ordinary men, compared to hardened criminals. They
think like ordinary people in most ways. The ordinary man and woman never
commits a crime because they have the same exaggerated idea of our
omnipotence.&quot; Saul's tone was neutral, descriptive, but in New York
Rebecca's heart skipped a beat: This was the new Saul talking, the one who was
no longer on the side of law and order.</p>
<p>&quot;So you just asked yourself, where's a good-sized hole near Las
Vegas?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That was all there was to it, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The American people will certainly be grateful to you. And how did it
happen that you got involved in this case? You're with the New York Police
Department, aren'n you?&quot;</p>
<p><i>How will he answer that one? </i>Rebecca wondered; just then the phone
rang.</p>
<p>Turning down the TV sound, she lifted the phone and said, &quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can tell by your voice you're the kind of woman who <i>fully meets
the criteria of my value system,&quot; </i>said August Personage. &quot;I want
to lick your ass and your pussy and have you piss on me and—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that's a most amazing story, Inspector Goodman,&quot; the
interviewer was saying. <i>Oh, hell, </i>Rebecca thought. Saul's expression was
so sincere that she knew he had just told one of the most outrageous lies of his
life.</p>
<p>The phone rang again. With a pounce Rebecca grabbed it and snouted,
&quot;Listen, you creep, if you keep calling me-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's no way to talk to a man who just saved the world,&quot; Saul's
voice said mildly.</p>
<p>&quot;Saul! But you're on television—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They videotaped that a half-hour ago. I'm at the Las Vegas Airport,
about to take a jet to Washington. I'm having a conference with the
President&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My God. What are you going to tell him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As much,&quot; Saul pronounced, &quot;as an asshole like him can
understand.&quot;</p>
<p>(In Los Angeles, Dr. Vulcan Troll watched the seismograph move upward to
Grade 2. That still wasn't serious, but he scratched a note to the graduate
student who would soon be replacing him. &quot;If this jumps to 3, call me at my
house.&quot; Then he drove home, passing Dillinger's bungalow, humming happily,
thankful that the rioting was ending and the Guard being withdrawn. At the lab
the graduate student, reading a paperback titled <i>Carnal Orgy, </i>didn't
notice when the graph jumped past 3 and hit 4.)</p>
<p>Danny Pricefixer, waking in Ingolstadt, glanced at his wristwatch. Noon. <i>My
God, </i>he thought; sleeping so late was a major sin in his system of morality.
Then he remembered a little of last night, and smiled contentedly, turning in
the bed to kiss Lady Velkor's neck. A huge black arm hung over the other
shoulder, and a black hand, limp in sleep, held her breast. &quot;My <i>God!&quot;
</i>Danny said out loud, remembering more, as Clark Kent sat up groggily and
stared at him.</p>
<p>(&quot;Smiling Jim&quot; Treponema, at that moment, was navigating a very
dangerous pass in the mountains of Northern California. Strapped to his back was
a 6mm Remington Model 700 Bolt Action rifle with 6-power Bushnell telescope; a
canteen of whiskey was hooked to one side of his belt, and a canteen of water to
the other. He was perspiring from labor, in spite of the altitude, but he was
one of the few happy people in the country, since he had been nowhere near a
radio for three days and had missed the whole terror connected with Anthrax
Leprosy Pi plague, the declaration of martial law, and the rioting and bombings.
He was on his yearly vacation, free from the sewer of smut in which he was
submerged forty-nine weeks of the year—the foulness and filth in which he
heroically struggled daily, risking his soul for the good of his fellow
citizens—and he was breathing clean air and thinking clean thoughts.
Specifically, as an avid hunter, he had read that only one American eagle still
survived, and he was determined to be immortalized in hunting literature as the
man who killed it. He knew well, of course, how ecologists and conservation-ists
would regard that achievement, but their opinions didn't bother him. A bunch of
fags, commies, and smut-</p>
<p>nuts: That was his estimate of those bleeding-heart types. Probably smoked
dope, too. Not a man's man among them. He shifted his rifle, which was pressing
his sweat-soaked shirt uncomfortably, and climbed onward and upward.)</p>
<p><i>Mama Sutra stared at the central Tarot card in the Tree of Life: It was
The Fool.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; the little Italian tree said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;This is getting ridiculous,&quot; Fission Chips muttered. &quot;I don't
intend to spend the rest of my life in conversation with trees.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a tree worth talking to,&quot; the dark-skinned tree with her hair
in a bun persisted.</p>
<p>He squinted. &quot;I know what you are,&quot; he said finally, &quot;half
tree and half woman. <i>Ergo, </i>a dryad. Benefit of classical education.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; said the dryad. &quot;But when you stop tripping,
you're going to crash. You'll remember London and your job, and you'll wonder
how you're going to explain the last month to them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody stole a month from me,&quot; Chips agreed pleasantly. &quot;A
cynical old swine named the Dealy Lama. Or another feller named Toad. Bad lot.
Shouldn't go around stealing months.&quot;</p>
<p>The tree handed him an envelope. &quot;Try not to lose that,&quot; she said.
&quot;It'll make everybody in your office so happy that they'll accept any story
you make up to explain how it took you a month to get it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The name of every BUGGER agent in the British government. Together with
the false names they use for the bank accounts where they keep all the money
they can't account for. And the account numbers and the names of-the banks, too.
In one nice package. All it needs is a red ribbon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think my leg is being pulled again,&quot; said Chips. But he was
coming down, and he opened the envelope and peered at the contents. &quot;This
is real?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;They won't be able to account for the money,&quot; the tree assured
him. &quot;Some very interesting confessions will be obtained.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who the devil are you?&quot; Chips asked, seeing a teen-age Italian
girl and not a tree.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm your holy guardian angel,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;You look like an angel,&quot; Chips admitted grudgingly, &quot;but I
don't believe any of this. Time travel, talking trees, giant toads, none of it.
Somebody slipped me a drug.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, somebody slipped you a drug. But I'm your holy guardian angel, and
I'm slipping you this envelope, and it'll make everything all right back in
London. All you have to do is make up a halfway reasonable lie . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was held prisoner in a BUGGER dungeon with a beautiful Eurasian
love-slave,&quot; Chips began improvising</p>
<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; she said. &quot;They won't believe it, but they'll
think you believe it. That's good enough.&quot; &quot;Who are you really?&quot;</p>
<p>But the tree only repeated, &quot;Don't lose that envelope,&quot; and walked
away, turning into an Italian teen-ager again, and then into a gigantic woman
carrying a golden apple. Hauptmann, chief of field operations for the Federal
Republic of Germany's police, looked around the Fuehrer Suite in disgust. He had
arrived from Bonn and headed straight for the Donau-Hotel, determined to make
some sense of the scandals, tragedies, and mysteries of the previous night. The
first suspect he grilled was <i>Freiherr </i>Hagbard Celine, sinister jet-set
millionaire, who had come to the rock festival with a large entourage. Celine
and Hauptmann talked quietly in one corner of the suite of the Donau-Hotel,
while the cameras of police photographers clicked away behind them.</p>
<p>Hauptmann was tall and thin, with close-cropped silver-gray hair, long,
vulpine features, and piercing eyes. &quot;Dreadful tragedy, the death of your
President last night,&quot; he said. &quot;My condolences. Also for the unhappy
state of affairs in your country.&quot; Actually, Hauptmann was delighted to see
the United States of America falling into chaos. He had been fifteen at the end
of World War II, had been called to the colors as the Allies advanced on German
soil, and had seen his country overrun by American troops. All of this made a
deeper and more lasting impression on him than the U.S.-West German cooperation
that developed later.</p>
<p>&quot;Not <i>my </i>president, not <i>my </i>country,&quot; said Hagbard
quickly. &quot;I was born in Norway. I lived in the U.S. for quite some time,
and did become a citizen for a while, when I was much younger than I am now. But
I renounced my American citizenship years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see,&quot; said Hauptmann, trying unsuccessfully to conceal his
distaste for Hagbard's indistinct sense of national identity. &quot;And what
country today has the honor of claiming you as a citizen?&quot;</p>
<p>Smiling, Hagbard reached for the inside pocket of the brass-buttoned
navy-blue yachtsman's blazer he had worn for the occasion. He handed his
passport to Hauptmann, who took it and grunted with surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Equatorial Guinea.&quot; He looked up, frowning. &quot;Fernando
Poo!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so,&quot; said Hagbard, a white-toothed grin breaking through his
dark features. &quot;I will accept your expression of sympathy for the sad state
of affairs in <i>that </i>country.&quot;</p>
<p>Hauptmann's dislike of this Latin plutocrat grew deeper. The man was
undoubtedly one of those unprincipled international adventurers who carried
citizenship the way many freighters carried Panamanian registry. Celine's wealth
was probably equal to or greater than the total wealth of Equatorial Guinea. Yet
it was likely that he had done nothing for his adopted country other than bribe
a few officials to obtain the citizenship. Equatorial Guinea had split asunder,
nearly plunging the world into a third and final war, and yet here was this
parasitical Mediterranean fop, driving to a rock festival in a Bugatti Royale
with a host of drones, yes-men, flunkies, minions, whores, dope fiends, and
all-round social liabilities. Disgusting!</p>
<p>Hagbard looked around. &quot;This room is a pretty foul place to have a
conversation. How can you stand that smell? It's nauseating me.&quot;</p>
<p>Pleased to be causing some discomfort to this man, whom he disliked more and
more as he got to know him, Hauptmann settled back in the red armchair, his
teeth bared in a smile. &quot;You will forgive me, <i>Freiherr </i>Celine, I
find it necessary to be here at this time and also necessary to talk to you.
However, I would have thought this peculiar odor of fish would not be unpleasant
to you. Perhaps your nautical dress has led me astray.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard shrugged. &quot;I am a seaman of sorts. But just because a man likes
the sea doesn't mean he wants to sit next to a ton of dead mackerel. What do you
think it is, anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no idea. I was hoping you could identify it for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just dead fish, that's all it smells like to me. I'm afraid you may be
expecting more from me all around than I can possibly provide. I suppose you
think I can tell you a lot about last night. Just what are you trying to find
out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First of all, I want to find out what actually happened. What we have,
I think, is a case of drug abuse on a colossal scale. And we—the Western world
in general—have had too many of those in recent years. Apparently there is not
a single person who was present at this festival who did not partake of some of
this soft drink dosed with LSD.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Treat every man to his dessert and none should 'scape tripping,&quot;
said Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was parodying Shakespeare,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;But it's not
very relevant. Please go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, so far no one has been able to give me a coherent or plausible
account of the evening's events,&quot; said Haupt-mann. &quot;There have been at
least twenty-seven deaths that I'm fairly sure of. There has been massive abuse
of LSD. There are numerous accounts of pistol, rifle, and machine-gun fire
somewhere on the shore of the lake. A number of witnesses say they saw many men
in Nazi uniforms running around in the woods. If that wasn't a hallucination,
dressing as a Nazi is a serious crime in the Federal Republic of Germany. So far
we have managed to keep much of this out of the papers by holding the press
people who came here incommunicado, but we will have to determine precisely what
crimes were committed and who committed them, and we must prosecute them
vigorously. Otherwise, we will appear to the whole world as a nation incapable
of dealing with the wholesale corruption of youth within our borders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All nations are wholesale corruptors of youth,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;I wouldn't worry about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Hauptmann grunted, seeing in his mind's eye a vision of drug-crazed
masqueraders in Nazi uniforms and himself in a German army uniform over thirty
years ago at the age of fifteen and understanding very well what Hagbard meant
&quot;I have my job to do,&quot; he said sullenly.</p>
<p><i>See how much more pleasant the world is now that the Saures are gone, </i>the
Dealy Lama flashed into his brain. Hagbard kept a poker face.</p>
<p>Hauptmann went on, &quot;Your own role in the incident seems to have been a
constructive one, <i>Freiherr </i>Celine. You are described as going to the
stage when the hysteria and the hallucinating had reached some sort of a climax
and making a speech which greatly calmed the audience.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed. &quot;I have no idea at all what I said. You know what I
thought? I thought I was Moses and they were the Israelites and I was leading
them across the Red Sea while the Pharaoh's army, intent on slaughtering them,
pursued.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only Israelites present last night seemed to have fared rather
badly. You're not Jewish yourself, are you, <i>Freiherr </i>Celine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not religious at all. Why do you ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought that then, perhaps, you could shed some light on the scene we
find here in these rooms. Well, no matter for the moment. It is interesting that
you thought you led them across the lake. In fact, this morning, when the police
reserves entered the area, they found most of the young people wandering around
on the shore of the lake opposite the festival&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, perhaps we all marched around it while we thought we were going
across it,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;By the way, didn't you have any men at the
festival at all? If you did, they should be able to tell you something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We had a few plainclothes agents there, and they could tell me nothing.
All but one had unknowingly taken the LSD, and the one who didn't must have been
hallucinating too, from some kind of psychological contagion. He saw the Nazis,
a glowing woman a hundred feet tall, a bridge across the lake. Sheer garbage. As
you doubtless noticed, there were no uniformed police there. Arrangements were
made—and sanctioned at the highest level of government —to leave policing at
the festival to its management. It was felt that, given the attitudes of youth
today, official police would not be effective in handling the huge crowd. I
might say, in my own opinion, I consider that a cowardly decision. But I'm not a
politician, thank God. As a result of that decision, order-keeping at the
festival was ultimately in the hands of people like yourself who happened to be
inspired to do something about the situation. And were themselves hampered, as
involuntary victims of LSD.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;in order to fully understand what
happened, you have to realize that many people there probably welcomed an acid
trip. Many must have brought their own acid and taken it I, personally, have had
a great deal</p>
<p>of experience with LSD. A man of my wide-ranging interests, you understand,
feels obligated to try everything once. I was taking acid back when it was still
legal everywhere in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Hauptmann sourly.</p>
<p>Hagbard looked around the room and said, &quot;Have you considered the
possibility that these men, old as they are, might have unknowingly imbibed LSD
and suffered heart failure or some such thing?&quot;</p>
<p>There were twenty-three dead men in the suite. Thirteen were in the large
parlor where Hagbard and Hauptman were sitting. The dead men, too, were seated,
in various attitudes of total collapse, some with their heads lolling back,
others bent forward at the waist, heads hanging between their knees, knuckles
resting on the floor. There were nine more old men in the bedroom, and one in
the bathroom. Most of them were white-haired; several were completely bald. Not
one could have been under eighty years of age, and several appeared to be over
ninety. The man in the bathroom had been caught by death in the embarrassing
position of sitting on the toilet with his pants down. This was the old
gentleman with the white mustache and the unruly forelock who had spoken harshly
to George in the lobby the night before last.</p>
<p>Hauptmann shook his head. &quot;I'm afraid it will be no easy task to find
out what happened to these men. They all seem to have died at about the same
moment. There are no observable traces of poison, no signs of struggle or pain,
except for the expression around the eyes. All of their eyes are open, and they
appear to be looking at some unguessable horror.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you have any idea who they are? Why did you say I might have been
able to help if I were Jewish?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have found their passports. They are all Israeli citizens. That in
itself is quite odd. Generally, Jews that old do not care to come to this
country, for obvious reasons. However, there was an organization connected with
the Zionist movement founded here in Ingolstadt on May 1, 1776. These elders of
Zion might have assembled here to celebrate the anniversary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;The Illuminati of Bavaria, wasn't
it? I remember hearing about them When we first arrived here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The organization was founded by an unfrocked Jesuit, and its membership
consisted of freemasons, freethinkers, and Jews. There were also some famous
names in politics and the arts: King Leopold, Goethe, Beethoven.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And this organization was behind the Zionist movement, you say?&quot;</p>
<p>Hauptmann brushed away the suggestion with long, slender fingers. &quot;I did
not say they were <i>behind </i>anything. There are always those who think that
every political or criminal phenomenon must have something behind it There is
always a conspiracy that explains everything. That is unscientific. If you wish
to understand events, you must analyze the masses of the people and the
economic, cultural, and social conditions in which they live. Zionism was a
logical development out of the situation of the Jews during the last hundred
years. One need not imagine some group of illuminated ones thinking it up and
promulgating the movement for devious reasons of their own. The Jews were in a
wretched condition in many places—they needed somewhere to go—a child could
have seen that Palestine was an attractive possibility.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;if the Illuminati are of no importance
in the history of Israel, what are these twenty-three old Israelis doing here on
the day of the organization's founding?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps <i>they </i>thought the Illuminati were important Perhaps they
themselves were members. I shall make <i>inquiries </i>to Israel about their
identities. Relatives will probably claim the bodies. Otherwise, the German
government will see that they are buried in Ingolstadt Jewish cemetery with
proper rabbinical ceremonies. The government is very solicitous of Jewish
persons. Nowadays.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe they were freethinkers,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Maybe they
wouldn't like being buried with religious ceremonies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The question is wearisome and unimportant,&quot; said Hauptmann.
&quot;We shall consult the Israeli government and do as it suggests.&quot; An
elderly waiter knocked and was admitted by one of Hauptmann's men. He pushed a
serving cart bearing a magnificent silver coffee urn, cups, and a tray full of
pastries. Before serving anyone else, he rolled the cart across the thick carpet
to Hauptmann and Hagbard. His rheumy eyes studiously avoided the bodies
scattered around the suite. He poured out coffee for both men.</p>
<p>&quot;Lots of cream and sugar,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;Black for me,&quot; said Hauptmann, picking up a pastry with cherry
filling and biting into it with relish.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know somebody hasn't dosed the coffee or the pastry with
LSD?&quot; said Hagbard, smiling mischievously.</p>
<p>Hauptmann brushed his hand over his hair and smiled back. &quot;Because I
would put this hotel out of business if I were served food tainted in any way,
and they know it. They will take the utmost precautions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now that we're being a little more sociable and drinking coffee
together,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;let me ask you a favor. Turn me loose today.
I have interests to look after in the U.S., and I'd like to be leaving.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were originally planning to stay for the entire week. Now,
suddenly, you have to leave at once. I don't understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was planning to stay, but that was before most of the U.S. government
got wiped out. Also, since the remainder of the festival is being called off,
there's no reason to stay. I'm still not clear on that, however. Why is the
festival being called off? Whose idea is it, and what are the reasons?&quot;</p>
<p>Hauptmann stared down his long nose at Hagbard and took another bite of the
pastry, while Hagbard wondered how the man could eat in the midst of this awful
smell. He could understand how a detective would not be bothered by the presence
of the dead, but the fishy smell was something else again.</p>
<p>&quot;To begin with, <i>Freiherr </i>Celine, there is the disappearance and
possible death by drowning of the four members of the Saure family, known as the
American Medical Association. Accounts of what happened to them are garbled,
fantastic, and contradictory, as are those of every other incident that occurred
last night. As I reconstruct it, they drove their car straight into the
lake.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From which side?&quot;</p>
<p>Hauptmann shrugged. &quot;It hardly matters. The lake is virtually
bottomless. If they're in there, I doubt that we will ever find them. They must
have been under the influence of LSD, and <i>they </i>certainly weren't used to
it.&quot; He looked accusingly at Hagbard. &quot;They were so <i>dean-cut. </i>Absolutely
the hope of the future. And the car was a national relic. A great loss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were they the only well-known casulaties?&quot; &quot;Who can say? We
have no accurate record of who was attending the festival. No list was kept of
those who bought tickets, as should have been done. A thousand young men and
women could have drowned themselves in that lake and we wouldn't know about it.
In any ease, the Saures, as you may not know, were the moving spirits behind the
In-golstadt festival. Very patriotic. They wished to do something to promote
tourism to Germany, particularly of Bavaria, since they were native
Bavarians.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;I read that Ingolstadt was their home
town.&quot;</p>
<p>Hauptmann shook his head. &quot;Their press agent gave that out when the
festival was conceived. Actually, they were born in northern Bavaria, in
Wolframs-Eschenbach. It is the birthplace of another famous German musician, the
<i>Minnesinger </i>Wolfram von Eschenbach, who wrote <i>Parziv-al. </i>Well, now
they are gone, barring a miracle, and no one else seems to be in charge. Without
them the festival is simply collapsing, like a headless body. Furthermore, the
government wants the festival shut down because we don't want a repetition of
last night. LSD is still illegal in West Germany, unlike, the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are parts of the U.S. where it's still illegal,&quot; said
Hagbard. &quot;It's not illegal in Equatorial Guinea, because we've just never
had a drug problem there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since you are an ethusiastic citizen of Equatorial Guinea, I am sure
that delights you,&quot; said Hauptmann. &quot;Well, <i>Freiherr </i>Celine, I
would like to release you immediately, but when IVe pieced together more of last
night's events I shall have more questions for you. I must ask you to stay in
the Ingolstadt area.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard stood up. &quot;If you'll agree not to have me tailed or guarded,
I'll give you my word that I'll stick around.&quot;</p>
<p>Hauptmann smiled thinly. &quot;Your word won't be necessary. Every road is
blocked; no planes are permitted to take off or land at Ingolstadt Aerodrome.
You can have the run of the town, the lake, and the festival area, and you will
not be disturbed.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard left at the same time the old waiter did. The waiter bowed Hagbard
out the door and when it closed behind him said, &quot;A great shame.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;they were all in their eighties. That's
a good age to die.&quot;</p>
<p>The waiter laughed. &quot;I am seventy-five, and I do not think any age is a
good age to die. But that is not what I was referring to. Perhaps <i>mein herr </i>did
not notice the fish-tank in the room. It was broken, and the fish were spilled
all the floor. I have taken care of that tank for over twenty years. It was a
fine collection of rare tropical fish. Even Egyptian mouth-breeders. Now they
are all dead. So it goes.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard wanted to ask the waiter what an Egyptian mouth-breeder was, but the
old man suddenly nodded, pushed open a doorway to a service room, and
disappeared.</p>
<p>Danny Pricefixer was wandering around in the dark with Lady Velkor and Clark
Kent, feeling absolutely wonderful, when Miss Portinari intercepted him.
&quot;This will interest you,&quot; she said, handing him an envelope similar to
the one she had handed Fission Chips.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; he asked, seeing her as a Greek woman in classic
robes holding a golden apple.</p>
<p>'Take a look.&quot;</p>
<p>He opened the envelope and found a picture of Tobias Knight and Zev Hirsch,
in the middle of the <i>Confrontation </i>office, setting the timer on the bomb.</p>
<p>&quot;This man,&quot; she said, pointing to Knight, &quot;is willing to turn
State's evidence. Against both Hirsch and Atlanta Hope. You've wanted to nab
them for a long time, haven't you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; Danny asked, staring.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the one Mama Sutra told you of, the one appointed to contact you
here in Ingolstadt. I am of the Illuminated.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;What are those two talking about?&quot; Clark Kent asked Lady Velkor.
&quot;Who knows?&quot; she shrugged. &quot;They're both tripping.&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;God's Lightning is the most active front in America today for the Cult
of the Yellow Sign,&quot; Miss Portinari went on, Telling the Mark the Tale ...
A few feet away, Joe Malik said to Hagbard, &quot;I don't like frame-ups. Even
for people like Hirsch and Hope.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You suspect us of unethical behavior?&quot; Hagbard asked innocently.</p>
<p>(Pat Walsh is dialing a phone.)</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe in jails,&quot; Joe said bluntly. &quot;I don't think
Atlanta and Zev will be any better when they get out. They'll be worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can be sure the Illuminati will protect you,&quot; Miss Portinari
concluded gravely. Danny Pricefixer continued staring at her.</p>
<p>The phone is ringing far away, dragging me back to a body, a self, a purpose,
shattering my memories of being the Ringmaster. I sit up and lift the receiver.
&quot;Hirsch,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;My name is Pat Walsh,&quot; a woman's voice says. &quot;I speak for
Atlanta herself. The pass word is Theleme.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go ahead,&quot; I say hoarsely, wondering if it's about that peacenik
professor we killed at UN plaza on April 1.</p>
<p>&quot;You're being framed for a bombing,&quot; she said. &quot;You have to go
into hiding.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed. &quot;Atlanta isn't returning to the States. She's been a
double agent for over two years. Working for me.&quot; (I found the warehouse
door the Walsh woman described. It was open, as she had promised, and I wondered
about the name on it, Gold &amp; Appel Transfers . . .) &quot;So is Tobias
Knight, and he'll cop a plea. It's all been carefully planned, Joe. You only
thought bombing your own office was <i>your </i>idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about Zev Hirsch?&quot; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&quot;He's having some very educational experiences about this time in New
York City,&quot; Hagbard replied. &quot;<i>I</i> don't believe in jails,
either.&quot;</p>
<p>And I am trapped, the three of them surround me, and Jubela demands, 'Tell us
the Word,&quot; Jubelo repeats, &quot;Tell us the Word,&quot; and Jubelum
unsheathes the sword, 'Tell us the Word, Zev Hirsch . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A bombing in New York?&quot; the President asked shrewdly, trying to
look as tough as his predecessor.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Saul went on. &quot;As soon as the link with God's Lightning
was clear to us, Barney and I took off for Las Vegas. You can understand
why.&quot;</p>
<p>The President didn't understand any of this, but wasn't about to admit that.
&quot;You headed for Las Vegas?&quot; he asked shrewdly, trying to look as tough
as his predecessor.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Saul said sincerely. &quot;As soon as we found out about
Anthrax Leprosy Pi and Dr. Mocenigo's death, we</p>
<p>realized the same organization must be implicated. God's Lightning—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God's Lightning?&quot; the President asked shrewdly, remembering
earlier years when he had been a guest speaker at their rallies.</p>
<p>&quot;And the secret group that has infiltrated them and taken them over, the
Cult of the Yellow Sign. We have reason to believe that an English intelligence
agent named Chips will be arriving in London in a few hours with evidence
against most of the Yellow Sign operatives within their government. You see,
sir, this is an international conspiracy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An international conspiracy?&quot; the President asked shrewdly.</p>
<p>And in Central Park our old friend Perri hops from tree to ground, snatches a
nut thrown by August Personage, and quickly runs around the tree three times in
case this friend-possibly-enemy produces a gun and starts blasting . . .</p>
<p>While far above the highest mountains in California another aspect of my
consciousness soars like winged poetry: and knows, somehow, more about what is
coming than Dr. Troll's seismograph: for I am the last, truly the last. The
ecologists are right: mine is not merely an endangered but nearly an extinct
species, and my senses have been sharpened beyond instinct by these last years.
I circle around, I circle around, I soar: I bank: I float. I am, rare moment for
me! not thinking about fish, for my belly is full at present I circle around,
circle around, thinking only about the soaring, the freedom, and, more vaguely,
about the bad vibes coming up from below. Must you have a name? Call me Hah'
One, then: haliaeetus leucocephalus the last: symbol once of imperial Rome and
now of imperial America: of which I neither know nor care, for all I know is the
freedom of my estate and about that the Romans and the Americans have never had
aught but the most confused and distorted ideas. Wearing my long green feathers
I circle around. I am Hali One and I scream, not with rage or with fear or with
anger; I scream with ecstasy, the terrible joy of my very existence, and the
scream echoes from mountain to mountain to another mountain, resonating onward
and onward, a sound that only another of my species could understand, and none
are left to hear it. But still I scream: the shriek of Shiva the Destroyer, true
face of Vishnu the Preserver and Brahma the Creator: for my scream is not of
life</p>
<p>or death but of life-in-death, and I am equally contemptuous of Perri and of
August Personage, of squirrels and of men, and of all lesser birds who cannot
ascend to my height and know the agony and supremacy of my freedom.</p>
<p>No—because they broke Billie Freshette slow and ugly and they broke Marilyn
Monroe fast and bright like lightning They broke Daddy and they broke Mama but
shit like I mean it this time they ain't going to break me No even if it's
greater with Simon than with any other man even if he knows more than any other
man I've had No it can't be him and it can't even be Hagbard who seems to be the
king of the circus the very Ringmaster and keeper of the final secret No it
can't be any man and it most certainly by Jesus and by Christ it can't be going
back to Mister Charlie's police force No it's dark like my own skin and dark
like the destiny they've inflicted on me because of my skin but whatever it is I
can only find it alone God the time that rat bit me while I was sleeping Daddy
screaming until he. was almost crying &quot;I'll kill the fucking landlord I'll
kill the motherfucker I'll cut his white heart out&quot; until Mama finally
calmed him No he died a little then No it would have been better if he had
killed the landlord No even if they caught him and they would have caught him No
even if he died in the goddam electric chair and we went on welfare No a man
shouldn't let that happen to his children he shouldn't be realistic and
practical No no matter how good it is no matter how wonderful the come it will
always be there in the back of my head that Simon is white No white radical
white revolutionary white lover it doesn't matter it still comes up white and
it's not acid and it's not a mood I mean shit you have to decide sooner or later
Are you on somebody else's trip or are you on your own No and I 'can't join
God's Lightning or even what's left of the old Women's Lib I mean shit that
poetry Simon quoted is all wrong No it's not true that no man is an island No
the truth is every man is an island and especially every woman is an island and
even more every black woman is an island</p>
<p>On August 23, 1928, Rancid, the butler in the Drake Mansion on old Beacon
Hill, reported a rather distressing fact to his employer. &quot;Good Lord
Harry,&quot; old Drake cried at first, &quot;is he turning Papist now?&quot; His
second question was less rhetorical: &quot;You're absolutely sure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt,&quot; Rancid replied. &quot;The maids showed me the
socks, sir. And the shoes.&quot;</p>
<p>That night there was a rattier strangulated attempt at conversation in the
mansion's old library. &quot;Are you going back to Harvard?&quot; &quot;Not
yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you at least going to try another damned alienist?&quot; &quot;They
call themselves psychiatrists these days, Father. I don't think so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dammit, Robert, what <i>did </i>happen in the war?&quot; &quot;Many
things. They all made profits for our bank, though, so don't worry about
them.&quot; &quot;Are you turning Red?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see no profit there. The State of Massachusetts killed two innocent
men today for holding opinions of that sort.&quot; &quot;Innocent my Aunt Fanny.
Robert, I know the judge personally—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And he believes what the friend of a banker should believe.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a long pause, and old Drake crushed out a cigar he had hardly
started. &quot;Robert, you <i>know </i>you're sick.&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is this latest thing—glass and nails in your shoes? Your mother
would die if she knew.&quot;</p>
<p>There was another silence. Robert Putney Drake finally answered, lanquidly,
&quot;It was an experiment. A phase. The Sioux Indians do much worse to
themselves in the Sun Dance. So do lots of chaps in Spanish monasteries, and in
India, among other places. It's not the answer.&quot; &quot;It's really
finished?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes. Quite. I'm trying something else.&quot; &quot;Something to
hurt yourself again?&quot; &quot;No, nothing to hurt myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, I'm glad to hear that. But I do wish you would go to
another alienist, or psychiatrist, or whatever they call themselves.&quot;
Another pause. &quot;You <i>can </i>pull yourself together, you know. Play the
man, Robert. Play the man.&quot;</p>
<p>Old Drake was satisfied. He had talked turkey to the boy; he had performed
his fatherly duty. Besides, the private detectives assured him that the Red
Business really was trivial: The lad had been to several anarchist and Communist
meetings, but his comments had been uniformly aloof and cynical.</p>
<p>It was nearly a year later when the really bad news from the private
investigators arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;How much will the girl take to keep her mouth shut?&quot; old Drake
asked immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;After we pay hospital expenses, maybe a thousand more,&quot; the man
from Pinkerton's said.</p>
<p>&quot;Offer her five hundred,&quot; the old man replied. &quot;Go up to a
thousand only if you have to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said maybe a thousand,&quot; the detective said bluntly. &quot;He
used a special kind of whip, one with twisted nails in the ends. She might want
two or three thou.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's only a common whore. They're used to this sort of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not to this extent.&quot; The detective was losing his deferential
tone. &quot;The photos of her back, and her buttocks especially, didn't bother
me much. But that's because I'm in this business and I've seen a lot. An average
jury would vomit, Mr. Drake. In court—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In court,&quot; old Drake pronounced, &quot;she would come before a
judge who belongs to several of my clubs and has investments in my bank. Offer
five hundred.&quot;</p>
<p>Two months thereafter, the stock market crashed and New York millionaires
began leaping from high windows onto hard streets. Old Drake, the next day, ran
into his son begging on the street near the Old Granary cemetery. The boy was
wearing old clothes from a secondhand store.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not that bad, son. We'll pull through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I know that. You'll come out ahead, in fact, if I'm any judge of
character.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then what the hell is this disgraceful damned foolishness?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Experience. I'm breaking out of a trap.&quot;</p>
<p>The old man fumed all the way back to the bank. That evening he decided it
was time for another open and honest discussion; when he went to Robert's room,
however, he found the boy thoroughly trussed up in chains and quite purple in
the face.</p>
<p>&quot;God! Damn! Son! What is <i>this?&quot;</i></p>
<p>The boy—who was twenty-seven and, in some respects, more sophisticated than
his father—grinned and relaxed.</p>
<p>The purple faded from his face. &quot;One of Houdini's escapes,&quot; he
explained simply.</p>
<p>&quot;You intend to become a stage magician? My <i>God!&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Not at all. I'm breaking out of another trap—the one that says nobody
but Houdini can do these things.&quot;</p>
<p>Old Drake, to do him justice, hadn't acquired his wealth without some
shrewdness concerning human peculiarities. &quot;I begin to see,&quot; he said
heavily. &quot;Pain is a trap. That was why you put the broken glass in your
shoes that time. Fear of poverty is a trap. That's why you tried begging on the
streets. You're trying to become a Superman, like those crazy boys in Chicago,
the 'thrill killers.' What you did to that whore last year was part of all this.
What else have you done?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A lot.&quot; Robert shrugged. &quot;Enough to be canonized as a saint,
or to be burnt as a diabolist. None of it seems to add up, though. I still
haven't found the way.&quot; He suddenly made a new effort, and the chains
slipped to the floor. &quot;Simple yoga and muscle control,&quot; he said
without pride. &quot;The chains in the mind are much harder. I wish there were a
chemical, a key to the nervous system . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Robert,&quot; said old Drake, &quot;you are going back to an alienist.
I'll have you committed if you won't go voluntarily.&quot;</p>
<p>And so Dr. Faustus Unbewusst acquired a new patient, at a time when many of
his most profitable cases were discontinuing therapy because of the monetary
depression. He made very few notes on Robert, but these were subsequently found
by an Illuminati operative, photostated, and placed in the archives at Agharti,
where Hagbard Celine read them in 1965. They were undated, and scrawled in a
hurried hand—Dr. Unbewusst, in reaction-formation against his own anal
component, was a conspicuously untidy and careless person—but they told a
fairly straightforward story:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RPD, age 27, latent homo. Father rich as Croesus. Five sessions per week @
$50 each, $250. Keep him in therapy 5 yrs that's a clear $65,000. Be ambitious,
aim for ten years. $130,000. Beautiful.</p>
<p>RPD not latent homo at all. Advanced psychopath. Moral imbecile. Actually
enjoys the money I'm soaking his father. Hopeless case. All drives egosyntonic.
Bastard doesn't give a fuck. Maybe as long as 12 yrs.?-$156,000. <i>Hot shit!</i></p>
<p>RPD back on sadism again. Thinks that's the key. Must use great care. If he
gets caught at something serious, jail or a sanitorium; and can kiss that
$156,000 good-bye. Maybe use drugs to calm him?</p>
<p>RPD in another schizo mood today. Full of some crap a gypsy fortune-teller
told him. Extreme care needed: If the occultists get him, that's 13 grand per<i>
</i>year out the window.</p>
<p>Clue to RPD: All goes back to the war. Can't stand the thought that all must
die. Metaphysical hangup. Nothing I can do. If only there were an immortality
pill. Risk of losing him to the occultists or even a church worse than I feared.
I can feel the 13 grand slipping away.</p>
<p>RPD wants to go to Europe. Wants meeting, maybe therapy, with that <i>sheissdreck
dummkopf </i>Carl Jung. Must warn parents too sick to travel.</p>
<p>RPD gone after only 10 months. A lousy 11-grand case. Too angry to see
patients today. Spent morning drafting letter to <i>Globe </i>on why
fortune-tellers should be forbidden by law. If I could get my hands on that
woman, on her fat throat, the bitch, the fat stinking ignorant bitch. $156,000.
Down the drain. Because he needs immortality and doesn't know how to get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(In Ingolstadt, Danny Pricefixer and Clark Kent are still staring at each
other over Lady Velkor's sleeping body when Atlanta Hope bursts into the room,
fresh from a shower, and throws herself on the bed, hugging and kissing
everybody. &quot;It was the first time,&quot; she cries. &quot;The first time I
ever really made it! It took all three of you.&quot; On the other side of Kent,
Lady Velkor opens an eye and says, &quot;Don't I get any credit? It takes Five
that way, remember?&quot;)</p>
<p>Mama Sutra was only thirty then, but she streaked her hair with gray to fit
the image of the Wise Woman. She recognized Drake as soon as he wandered into
the tea parlor: old Drake's son, the crazy one, loaded.</p>
<p>He motioned to her before the waitress could take his order. Mama Sutra,
quick to pick up clues, could tell from his suit's wrinkles that he had been
lying down; Boston Common is a long walk from Beacon Hill; there were shrinks in
the neighborhood; ergo, he hadn't come from home but from a therapy session.</p>
<p>&quot;Tea leaves or cards?&quot; she asked courteously, sitting across from
him at the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Cards,&quot; he said absently, looking down from the window to the
Common. &quot;Coffee,&quot; he added to the waitress. &quot;Black as sin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were you listening to the preachers down there?&quot; Mama Sutra asked
shrewdly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; He grinned, engagingly. &quot; 'He that believeth shall
never taste death.' They're in rare form today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shuffle,&quot; she said, handing the cards over. &quot;But they
awakened some spiritual need in you, my son. That's why you came up here.&quot;</p>
<p>He met her eye cynically. &quot;I'm willing to try any kind of witchcraft
once. I just came from a practitioner of the latest variety, just off the boat
from Vienna a few years.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Bull's-eye, </i>she thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither his science nor their unenlightened faith can help you,&quot;
Mama said somberly, ignoring his cynicism. &quot;Let us hope that the cards will
show the way.&quot; She dealt a traditional Tree of Life.</p>
<p>At the crown was Death upside-down, and below it were the King of Swords in
Chokmah and the Knight of Wands in Binah. &quot;He that believeth shall never
taste death,&quot; he had quoted cynically.</p>
<p>&quot;I see a battlefield,&quot; she began; it was common Boston gossip that
Drake first started acting odd after the war. &quot;I see Death come very close
to you and then miss you.&quot; She pointed to the reverse Death card with a
dramatic finger. &quot;But many died, many that you cared for deeply.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I liked a few of them,&quot; he said grudgingly. &quot;Mostly I was
worried about my own a—my own hide. But go ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>She looked at the Knight of Wands in the Binah position. Should she mention
the bisexuality implied? He was going to a shrink, and might be able to take it.
Mama tried to hold the Knight of Wands and King of Swords together in her focus,
and the way became clear. &quot;There are two men in you. One loves other men,
perhaps too much. The other is desperately trying to free himself from all of
humanity, even from the world. You're a Leo,&quot; she added suddenly, taking a
leap.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, unimpressed. &quot;August 6.&quot; He was thinking
that she had probably looked up the birthdates of all the richer individuals in
town in case they ever wandered in.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very hard for Leos to accept death,&quot; she said sadly.
&quot;You are like Buddha after he saw the corpse on the road. No matter what
you have or own, no matter what you achieve, it will never be enough, for you
saw too many corpses in the war. Ah, my son, would that I could help you! But I
only read cards; I am no alchemist who sells the Elixir of Eternal Life.&quot;
While he was digesting that one—a sure hit, she felt—Mama rushed on to
examine the Five of Wands reversed in Chesed and the Magus upright in Ge-burah.
&quot;So many wands,&quot; she said. &quot;So many fire signs. A true Leo, but
so much of it turned inward. See how the energetic Knight of Wands descends to
the Five upside-down: All your energies, and Leos are very powerful, are turned
against yourself. You are a burning man, trying to consume yourself and be
reborn. And the Magus, who shows the way, is below the King of Swords and
dominated by him: Your reason won't allow you to accept the necessity of the
fire. You are still rebelling against Death.&quot; The Fool was in Tipareth and,
surprisingly, upright. &quot;But you are very close to taking the final step.
You are ready to let the fire consume even your intellect and die to this
world.&quot; This was going swimmingly, she thought—and then she saw the Devil
in Netzach and the Nine of Swords reversed in Yod. The rest of the Tree was even
worse: the Tower in Yesod and the Lovers reversed (of course!) in Malkuth. Not a
cup or a pentacle anywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;You're going to emerge as a much stronger man,&quot; she said weakly.</p>
<p>&quot;That isn't what you see,&quot; Drake said. &quot;And it isn't what I
see. The Devil and the Tower together are a pretty destructive pair, aren't
they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose you know what the Lovers reversed means, too?&quot; she
asked.</p>
<p>&quot; 'The Answer of the Oracle Is Always Death,' &quot; he quoted.</p>
<p>&quot;But you won't accept it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to conquer Death—until science produces an immortality
pill—is to make him your servant, your company cop,&quot; Drake said calmly.
&quot;That's the key I've been looking for. The bartender never becomes an
alcoholic, and the high priest laughs at the gods. Besides, the Tower is rotten
to the core and deserves to be destroyed.&quot; He pointed abruptly to the Fool.
&quot;You have some real talents obviously—even if you do cheat like everybody
in this racket—and you must know there are two choices after crossing the
Abyss. The right-hand path and the left-hand path. I seem to be headed for the
left-hand path. I can see that much, and it confirms what I already suspect. Go
ahead and tell me the rest of what you see; I'm not afraid to hear it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well.&quot; Mama wondered if he was one of the few, the very few,
who would eventually come to the attention of the Shining Ones. &quot;You will
make Death your servant, as a tactic to master him. Yours is, indeed, the
left-hand path. You will cause immense suffering—especially to yourself at
first. But after a while you won't notice that; after a while you won't even
notice the horrors that you inflict on others. Men will say that you are a
materialist, a worshipper of money. What do you hate most?&quot; she asked
abruptly.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentimental slop and lies. All the Christian lies in Sunday school, all
the democratic lies in the newspapers, all the socialist lies our so-called
intellectuals are spouting these days. Every rotten, crooked, sneaking,
hypocritical deception people use to hide from themselves that we're all still
hunting animals in a jungle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You admire Neitzsche?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was crazy. Let's just say I have less contempt for him, and for
DeSade, than I have for most intellectuals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. So we know what the Tower is that you will destroy. Everything in
America that smacks of democracy or Christianity or socialism. The whole facade
of humanitarianism from the Constitution onward to the present. You will turn
your fire loose and burn all that up with your Leonine energies. You will force
your view of America into total reality, and make every citizen afraid of the
jungle and of the death that lurks in the jungle. Crime and commerce are moving
closer together, due to Prohibition; you will complete their marriage. All, all
this, just to make Death your servant instead of your master. The money and
power are just incidental to that.&quot;</p>
<p>NO—because even if you think you have it beat even if you think you can
work out a reconciliation a separate peace I mean shit the war still goes on No
you're only kidding yourself Even say I love Simon and that's all Holly-</p>
<p>wood bullshit you can't really tell in only one week no matter how good it is
but even if I love Simon the war goes on as long as we're going around in
separate skins White Man Black Man Bronze Man White Woman Black Woman Bronze
Woman even if Hagbard claims to have gotten past all that on his submarine it's
only because they're under the water and away from the world Out here the
bastards are using live ammunition like it says in the old joke Maybe that's the
only truth in the world Not the Bibles or poetry or philosophy but just the old
jokes Especially the bad jokes and the sad jokes No they're using live
ammunition I mean shit they never see me all of them White Man Black Man Bronze
Man White Woman Black Woman Bronze Woman they look at me and I'm in their game I
have my role I am Black Woman I am never just me No it goes on and on every step
upward is a step into more hypocrisy until the game is stopped completely and
nobody has found out how to do that No the more Simon says that he does see me
the more he's lying to himself No he never makes it with White Woman because
she's too much like his mother or some damned Freudian reason like that I mean
shit No I can't go on in their game I am going to scream with rage I am going to
scream like an eagle I am going to scream in the ears of the whole world until
somebody does see me until I am not Black Woman and not Black and not Woman and
nothing No nothing <i>justme </i>No they'll say I'm giving up love and sanity
Well fuck them fuck them all No I won't turn back the acid has changed
everything No at the end of it when I really am <i>me </i>maybe then I can find
a better love and a better sanity No but first I have to find <i>me</i></p>
<p>&quot;Go on.&quot; Drake was unsmiling but undisturbed.</p>
<p>&quot;The King of Swords and the Knight of Wands are both very active. You
could do all this harmlessly, by becoming an artist and <i>showing </i>this
vision of the jungle. You don't have to create it literally and inflict it on
your fellow human beings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop preaching. Just read the cards. You're better at it than I am, but
I can see enough to know that there is no such alternative for me. The other
wand and the other sword are reversed. I can't be satisfied to do it in symbolic
form. I must do it so that everybody is affected by it, not just the few who
read books or go to concerts. Tell me what I don't know. Why is the line from
the Fool to the Tower completed in the Lovers reversed? I know that I can't love
anyone, and I don't believe that anybody else ever does, either—that's more
sentiment and hypocrisy. People use each other as masturbating machines and
crying towels, and they <i>call </i>it love. But there's a deeper meaning. What
is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Start from the top: Death reversed. You reject Death, so the Fool
cannot undergo rebirth and enter the right-hand path when he crosses the Abyss.
Therefore: the left-hand path, the destruction of the Tower. There is only one
end to that chain of karma, my son. The Lovers means Death, just as Death means
Life. You are rejecting natural death, and therefore refusing natural life. Your
path will be an unnatural life leading to a death that is against nature. You
will die as a man before your body dies. The fire is still self-destructive,
even if you turn it outward and use the whole world as a stage for your private <i>Gotterdammerung.
</i>Your primary victim will still be yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have the talent,&quot; Drake said coldly, &quot;but you are still
basically a fraud, like everyone in this business. <i>Your </i>worst victim,
madam, is yourself. You deceive yourself with the lies that you have so often
told others. It's the occupational disease of mystics. The truth is that it
doesn't matter whether I destroy myself alone or destroy this planet—or turn
around and try to find my way to the right-hand path in some dreary monastery.
The universe will roll blindly along, not caring, not even <i>knowing. </i>There's
no Granddaddy in the clouds to pass a last judgment—there's only a few
airplanes up there, learning more and more about how to carry bombs. They
court-martialed General Mitchell for saying it, but it's the truth. The next
time around they'll really bomb the hell out of civilian populations. And the
universe won't know or care about that either. Don't tell me that my flight from
Death leads back to Death; I'm not a child, and I know that all paths lead back
to Death eventually. The only question is: Do you cower before him all your life
or do you spit in his eye?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can transcend abject fear and rebellious hatred both. You can see
that he is only part of the Great Wheel and, like all other parts, necessary to
the whole. Then you can accept him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Next you'll be telling me to love him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and I can learn to see the great and glorious Whole Picture. I can
see all the men defecating and urinating in their trousers before they died at
Chateau-Thierry, watching their own guts fall out into their laps and screaming
out of a hole that isn't even a mouth any more, as manifestations of that
sublime harmony and balance which is ineffable and holy and beyond all speech
and reason. Sure. I can see that, if I knock half of my brain out of commission
and hypnotize myself into thinking that the view from that weird perspective is
deeper and wider and more <i>truly true </i>than the view from an unclouded
mind. Go to the quadruple-amputee ward and try to tell them that. You speak of
death as a personified being. Very well: Then I must regard him as any other
entity that gets in my way. Love is a myth invented by poets and other people
who couldn't face the world and crept off into corners to create fantasies to
console themselves. The fact is that when you meet another entity, either it
makes way for you or you make way for it. Either it dominates and you submit, or
you dominate and it submits. Take me into any club in Boston and I'll tell you
which millionaire has the most millions, by the way the others treat him. Take
me into any workingman's bar and I'll tell you who has the best punch in a
fistfight, by the way the others treat him. Take me into any house and I'll tell
you in a minute whether the husband or the wife is dominant. Love? Equality?
Reconciliation? Acceptance? Those are the excuses of the losers, to persuade
themselves that they choose their condition and weren't beaten down into it.
Find a dutiful wife, who truly loves her husband. I'll have her in my bed in
three days, maximum. Because I'm so damned attractive? No, because I understand
men and women. I'll make her understand, without saying it aloud and shocking
her, that the adultery will, one way or another, hurt her husband, whether he
knows about it or not. Show me the most servile colored waiter in the best
restaurant in town, and after he's through explaining Christianity and humility
and all the rest of it, count how many times a day he steps into the kitchen to
spit in his handerchief. The other employess will tell you he has a 'chest
condition.' The condition he has is chronic rage. The mother and the child? An
endless power struggle. Listen to the infant's cry change in pitch when Mother
doesn't come at once. Is that fear you hear? It's rage—insane fury at not
having total dominance. As for the mother herself, I'd wager that ninety percent
of the married women in the psychiatrists' care are there because they can't
admit to themselves, can't escape the lie of love long enough to admit to
themselves, how often they want to strangle that monster in the nursery. <i>Love
</i>of country? Another lie; the truth is fear of cops and prisons. Love of art?
Another lie; the truth is fear of the naked truth without ornaments and false
faces on it. Love of truth itself? The biggest lie of all: fear of the unknown.
People learn acceptance of all this and achieve wisdom? They surrender to
superior force and call their cowardice maturity. It still comes down to one
question: Are you kneeling at the altar, or are you on the altar watching the
others kneel to you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wheel of the Tarot is the wheel of Dharma,&quot; Mama Sutra said
softly when he had concluded. &quot;It is also the wheel of the galaxy, which
you see as a blind machine. It rolls on, as you say, no matter what we think or
do. Knowing that, I accept Death as part of the wheel, and I accept your
nonacceptance as another part. I can control neither. I can only repeat my
warning, which is not a lie but a fact about the structure of the Wheel: By
denying death, you guarantee that you will meet him finally in his most hideous
form.&quot;</p>
<p>Drake finished his coffee and smiled whimsically. &quot;You know,&quot; he
said, &quot;my contempt for lies has an element of the very sentimentality and
foolish idealism that I have been rejecting. Perhaps I will be most effective if
I never speak so honestly again. When you hear of me next, I might be known as a
philanthropist and benefactor of mankind.&quot; He lit a cigar thoughtfully.
&quot;And that would even be true if your Tarot mysticism is correct after all.
If Death is necessary to the Wheel, along with all the other parts, then I am
necessary also. The Wheel would collapse, perhaps, if my spirit of rebellion
were not there to balance your spirit of acceptance. Imagine that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is true. That is why I have warned you but not judged you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I am, as Goethe says, 'part of that force which aims at evil and
only achieves good'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is a thought which you should try to remember when the Dark Night
of Sammael descends upon you at the end.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More cant,&quot; Drake said, with a return to his previous cynicism.
&quot;I aim at evil and I will achieve evil. The Wheel and all its harmonious
balances and all-healing paradoxes is just another myth of the weak and
defeated. One strong man can stop the Wheel or tear it to shreds if he dares
enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps. We who study the Wheel do not know all of its secrets. Some
believe that your spirit reappears constantly in history, because it is fated,
eventually, to triumph. Maybe this is the last century of terrestrial mortals,
and the next century will be the time of the cosmic immortals. What will happen
then, when the Wheel is stopped, none of us can predict. It may be 'good' or
'evil' or even—to quote your favorite philosopher—beyond good and evil. We
cannot say. That is another reason I do not judge you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; Drake said with sudden emotion. &quot;We're both lying.
It's not all this philosophical or cosmic. The simple fact is that I couldn't
sleep nights, and nothing I tried in conventional 'cures' could help me, until I
began to help myself by systematically rebelling against everything that seemed
stronger than me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know. I didn't know it was insomnia. It might have been nightmares or
dizzy spells or sexual impotence. But there was some way that the scenes you saw
in Chateau-Thierry lived on and goaded you to wake out of the dream of the
sleepwalkers on the streets. You are waking: You stand on the abyss.&quot; She
pointed to the Fool and the dog who barks at his heels. &quot;And I am the noisy
little bitch barking to warn you that you can still choose the right-hand path.
The decision is not final until you cross the abyss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the cards show that I really have very little choice. Especially in
the world that is going to emerge from this depression.&quot;</p>
<p>Mama Sutra smiled without forgiveness or final condemnation. &quot;This is no
age for saints,&quot; she agreed softly. 'Two dollars please.&quot;</p>
<p><i>George, don't make no bull moves. </i>The Dutchman saw it all clearly now.
Capone and Luciano and Maldonado and Lepke and all the rest of them were afraid
of Winifred and the Washington crowd. They were planning a deal, and his death
was part of the bargain. The fools didn't know that you can never negotiate from
fear. They thought of the Order only as a handy gimmick for international
communications and illicit trade; they were too dumb to really study the
Teachings. Especially, they had never understood the third Teaching: <i>Fear is
Failure. </i>Once you're afraid of the bulls, you're lost. But the bull was
gone. &quot;What have you done with him?&quot; he shouted at the hospital wall.</p>
<p>(Smiling Jim had seen the eagle only the day before. Its nest was definitely
on one of these peaks. He would get it: He knew it in his bones, a hunch so
strong it couldn't be doubted. Panting, sweating, every muscle aching, he
climbed onward . . . The coffee leaped out of the paper cup and slurped onto the
pages of <i>Carnal Orgy. </i>Igor Beaver, the graduate student, looked up in
astonishment: The seismograph stood at grade 5. A mile away, Dillinger woke as
the bedroom door slammed shut and his favorite statue, King Kong atop the Empire
State Building, fell off the bureau.)</p>

<p>Mama Sutra looked down through the window at Boston Common. Robert Putney
Drake had stopped, and was listening to one of the preachers again; even at this
distance she could recognize the cool, closed smile on his face.</p>
<p>The Dealy Lama sat down across from her. &quot;Well?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Definitely. The Order will have to intervene.&quot; Mama shook her head
sadly. &quot;He's a menace to the whole world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Slowness is beauty,&quot; the Dealy Lama said. &quot;Let the Lower
Order contact him first. If they decide he's worth the effort, then we'll act. I
think I shall persuade Hagbard to attend Harvard, so he can be in his
neighborhood and keep an eye on him, so to speak.&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">IT'S THE WORD OF THE BIBLE AND THE WORD OF

<p>&quot;How old are you actually?&quot; Mama asked curiously.</p>
<p>The Dealy Lama looked at her levelly. &quot;Would you believe thirty thousand
years?&quot;</p>
<p>She laughed. &quot;I should have known better than to ask. You can always
tell the higher members by their sense of humor.&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">AND THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS: NO REMISSION, NO

<p>Hagbard's mouth fell open in completely genuine surprise. &quot;Well, <i>sink
</i>me,&quot; he said, beginning to laugh.</p>
<p>Behind him on a wall, Joe noticed dizzily, was a brand-new graffito, probably
scrawled by somebody out of his skull on the acid: THE PIGEONS IN B. F.
SKINNER'S CAGES</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS.</span></b></p>
<p>&quot;We both pass,&quot; Hagbard went on happily. &quot;We've been judged
and found innocent by the great god Acid.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe took a deep breath. &quot;And when do you start to explain in
monosyllables or sign language or semaphore or something a non-Illuminated moron
like me can understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You read all the clues. It was right out in the open. It was plain as a
barn door. It was as conspicuous as my nose and twice as homely—in every sense
of that word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard, for Christ's sake and for my sake and for all our sakes, will
you stop gloating and give me the answer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Hagbard pocketed the gun carelessly. &quot;I'm a bit
giddy. I've been waging a kind of war all night, high on acid. It was a strain,
especially since I was at least ninety percent sure you'd kill me before it was
over.&quot; He lit one of his abominable cigars. &quot;Briefly, then, the
Illuminati is benevolent, compassionate, kindly, generous, et cetera, et cetera.
Add all the other complimentary adjectives you can think of. In short, we're the
good guys.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But—but—it can't be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It can be and it is.&quot; Hagbard motioned him toward the Bugatti.
&quot;Let's Sit Down, if I may permit myself one more acrostic before the codes
and puzzles are all resolved.&quot; They climbed into the front seat, and Joe
accepted the brandy decanter Hagbard offered. &quot;Of course,&quot; Hagbard
went on, &quot;when I say 'good,' you've got to understand that all terms are
relative. We're as good as is possible in this fucked-up section of the galaxy.
We're not perfect Certainly, I'm not, and I haven't observed anything
approaching immaculate perfection in any of the other Masters of the Temple
either. But we are, in human terms and by ordinary standards, decent chaps.
There's a reason for that. It's the basic law of magic, and it's in every
textbook. You must have read it somewhere. Do you know what I mean?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe took a stiff snort of the brandy. It was peach—his favorite. &quot;Yes,
I think. 'As ye give, so shall ye get.' &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Precisely.&quot; Hagbard took back the bottle and had a snort himself.
&quot;Mind you, Joe, that's a scientific law, not a moral commandment. There are
no commandments, because there is no commander anywhere. All authority is a
delusion, whether in theology or in sociology. Everything is radically, even
sickeningly, free. The first law of magic is as neutral as Newton's first law of
motion. It says that the equation balances, and that's all it says. You are
still free to give evil and pain, if you decide you must. Once done, however,
you never escape the consequences. It always comes back. No prayers, sacrifices,
mortifications, or supplications will change it, any more than they'll change
Newton's laws or Einstein's. So we're 'good,' as moralists would say, because we
know enough to have a bloody strong reason to be good. In the last week things
went too fast, and I became 'evil'—I deliberately ordered and paid for the
deaths of various people, and set in motion processes that had to lead to still
other deaths. I knew what I was doing, and I knew—and still know—that I'll
pay for it. Such decisions are extremely rare in the history of the Order, and
my superior, the Dealy Lama, tried to persuade me it was unnecessary this time
too. I disagreed; I take the responsibility. No man or god or goddess can change
it. I will pay, and I'm ready to pay, whenever and however the bill is
presented.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard, <i>what are you?&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;A <i>mehum, </i>the Saure family would say,&quot; Hagbard grinned.
&quot;A mere human. No more. Not one jot more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How much blood?&quot; Robert Putney Drake asked. He was astonished at
his own words; in all his experiments at breaking through the walls, he had
never lowered himself to heckling an ignorant street preacher.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">ALL THE BLOOD IN THE WORLD ISN'T ENOUGH. EVERY
MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD ISN'T ENOUGH. EVEN ALL THE ANIMALS IF YOU ADDED THEM IN

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">ENOUGH, BROTHERS. THE GOOD BOOK SAYS SO.</span></p>
<p>&quot;There were five of us,&quot; John-John Dillinger was explaining to
George as they trudged back toward Ingolstadt, having lost Hagbard and the
Bugatti in the crowd. &quot;My folks kept it a secret. German people, very
superstitious and secretive. They didn't want reporters all over the place and
headlines about the first quintuplets to live. The Dionne family got all that,
much later.&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">BECAUSE ALL THE BLOOD IN THE WORLD ISN'T
EQUAL TO ONE DROP. NOT ONE DROP</span></b></p>
<p>&quot;John Herbert Dillinger is in Las Vegas, trying to track down the
plague—unless he already finished up and went home to Los Angeles.&quot;
John-John smiled. &quot;He was always the brains of the bunch. Runs a rock-music
company, real professional businessman. He was the oldest, by a couple of
minutes, and we all sort of look up to him. He served the prison time, even
though I'm the one who rightly should have, seeing that robbing that grocer was
my dumb idea. But he said he could take it without cracking up, and he was
right.&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">NOT ONE
DROP, NOT ONE DROP, OF THE PRECIOUS BLOOD OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIST.</span></b></p>
<p>&quot;I see,&quot; Drake said. &quot;And was that A, B, AB, or O?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;John Hoover Dillinger lives in Mad Dog, under the name D. J.
Hoover—he's not above letting people suspect he's a distant relative of J.
Edgar's. Mostly,&quot; John-John said, &quot;he's retired. Except occasionally
for little jobs like helping arrange convincing jail breaks, say, when Jim
Cart-wright wants to let a prisoner get out in a realistic fashion. He gave
Naismith the idea for the John Dillinger Died for You Society.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about the other two?&quot; George asked, thinking that it would be
even harder to decide whether he loved Stella more than Mavis or Mavis more than
Stella now that he knew they were the same person. He wondered how Joe felt,
since he obviously dug Miss Mao Tsu-hsi and she was that person also. Three in
one and one in three. Like Dillinger. Or was Dillinger five in three? George
realized suddenly that he was still tripping a little. Dillinger was five in
one, not five in three: the law of Fives again. Did that mean there were two
more in the Mavis-Stella-Mao complex, two that he hadn't met yet? Why did two
and three keep popping up in all this?</p>
<p>&quot;The other two are dead,&quot; John-John said sadly. &quot;John Edgar
Dillinger was born first, and he went and died first. Fast and furious, he was.
It was him that plugged that bank guard in East Chicago while the rest of us
were vacationing and laying low in Miami. Always the hothead, he was. Had a
heart attack back in '43 and went to an early grave. John Thomas Dillinger went
in '69. He was in Chicago in '68 on a JAM assignment, meeting with a crazy
English spy named Chips. British Intelligence somehow got a report that the
Democratic Convention was being run by the Bavarian Illuminati and would end
with an assassination. They didn't believe in the Illuminati so they sent Chips;
they always send him on wild cases, 'cause he's nutty enough to take them
seriously and do a thorough job. Both of them got tear-gassed coming out of the
Hilton Hotel, and poor Chips got thrown in a paddy-wagon with a bunch of young
radicals. John Thomas had a chest problem already, a chronic asthma, and the
tear gas made it a lot worse. He went from doctor to doctor, and finally passed
away early in '69. So there's a cop in Chicago who could boast that he really
killed John Dillinger, only he doesn't know it. Isn't life peculiar?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Saure family only <i>thought </i>they were in the Illuminati,&quot;
Hagbard went on. &quot;Hitler and Stalin only <i>thought </i>they were in the
Illuminati. Old Weishaupt only <i>thought </i>he was in the Illuminati. It's
that simple. The moral of the whole story is: Beware of cheap Occidental
imitations.&quot; He smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's beginning to penetrate,&quot; Joe said slowly. &quot;It
was, of course, the very first hypothesis I formed: There have been many groups
in history who called themselves the Illuminati, and they weren't all aiming at
exactly the same thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Precisely.&quot; Hagbard puffed again at his cigar. &quot;That's the
natural first suspicion of any non-paranoid mind. Then, as you explore the
evidence, links between these groups begin to appear. Eventually the paranoid
hypothesis begins to appear more plausible and you begin to believe there always
has been one Illuminati, using the same basic slogans and symbols and aiming at
the same basic goal. I sent Jim Cartwright to you with that yarn about three
conspiracies —the ABC or Ancient Bavarian Conspiracy, the NEC or New Bavarian
Conspiracy, and the CBS or Conservative Bavarian Seers—to set you thinking
that the truth might be midway backward toward the simple first idea. From here
on in, forget that I represent the original Illuminati. In fact, in recent
centuries we don't use a name at all. We employ only the initials A.A., written
like this.&quot; He sketched on a Donau-Hotel matchbook:</p>
<p>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:
13.5pt">:.</span></i></p>
<p>&quot;A lot of occult writers,&quot; he went on, &quot;have made some amazing
guesses as to what that means. Actually, it doesn't mean a damned thing. To
prevent our name being stolen and misused again, we don't have a name. Anybody
who thinks he's guessed the name and tries to pass himself off as an initiate by
declaring that we're really the Atlantean Arcanum or the Argenteum Astrum or
whatever immediately reveals that he's a fraud. It's a neat gimmick,&quot;
Hagbard intoned gloomily. &quot;I only wish we had thought of it centuries
earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>The buzzer on the President's secretary's desk buzzed as Saul and Barney
passed through the outer door. The secretary flipped the switch, and the
President said, &quot;Find out the highest medal a civilian can get, and order
two, on my signature, for those two detectives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; the secretary said, scribbling.</p>
<p>&quot;And then ask the FBI to check out that older one. He looked like a kike
to me,&quot; the President said shrewdly.</p>
<p>NO—because I'd be a fool to think miracles can occur in this world before
somebody pays the rent and the taxes and shows that their papers are in order
and the people who are running it can always tell you your papers are not in
order No because there are no magicians and even Hagbard is mostly a fraud and a
con man even if he means well No because I'm not Pope Joan if there ever was a
Pope Joan No because like the song says I'm not a queen I'm a woman and the
wrong color woman to boot No because there will be rivers of blood and the earth
will be shaken before we can overturn Boss Charlie because it isn't a simple
one-night symbolic Armageddon like Hagbard fooled them all into thinking No
because Hagbard is some kind of magician and put us all on his own trip for a
while but the real world isn't a trip it's a bummer No because the lovers don't
live happily ever after what happens is that they get married and get into debt
and live in slavery ever after and I've got to find something better than that
No because none of us are driving the car it's the car that's driving us No
because it's like that old joke &quot;Balls&quot; said the queen &quot;if I had
them I'd be king&quot; and &quot;Nuts&quot; said the prince &quot;I've got them
and I'm not king&quot; and &quot;Crap&quot; said the king and thirty thousand
royal subjects squatted and strained for in those days the king's word was law
Hagbard would call it anality and sexism and ageism but it just comes down to
the women and children getting all the crap right in the face and a few males
owning everything the truth is all in the old jokes especially the bad jokes I'm
still tripping but this is true they can always say your papers are not in order
No because sometimes you've got to be a hermit and then come back later when
you're together No because the wheel keeps spinning and doesn't give a fuck if
there's going to be any change it's got to be that some human being somewhere
does give a fuck No because I've never found a way to shut Simon's mouth and
make him listen No because Jesus Christ was a black man and they've even lied
about that he was another black man they killed and they won't admit it No
because death is the currency in every empire Roman or American or any other all
empires are the same Death is always the argument they use No because the whole
world can go to the Devil and I'm taking care of Mary Lou No because look at

<p>&quot;It's grade 5 and moving up toward 6,&quot; Igor Beaver shouted into the
phone.</p>
<p>&quot;You idiot, don't you think I can tell that from here?&quot; Dr. Troll
shouted back. &quot;My bed was bouncing around like it had Saint Vitus' dance
even before you called.&quot; His emotion was merely professional anger at the
student's failure to obey orders; Grade 5 is nothing to get exerted about if
you're a Californian, and even Grade 6 causes anxiety only among tourists or
believers in the famous Edgar Cayce prophecy . . . John Herbert Dillinger, one
of those believers, was already in the garage, pajama tops tucked in to hastily
donned trousers, bare foot on the starter . . . But Smiling Jim climbed
blissfully upward, enjoying total communication with nature, the mystic rapture
of the true hunter before he gets his chance to open fire and blast a chunk of
nature to hell . . .</p>

<p>&quot;He's heckling the preacher,&quot; Mama said. &quot;A small beginning,
certainly, for the kind of destiny he seems to be choosing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's heckling himself,&quot; the Dealy Lama pronounced.
&quot;Christianity, rightly understood, is an encounter with Death. He's still
struggling with that problem. He wants to believe in the symbolism of the
Resurrection, but he can't. Too much intellect—King of Swords—keeping the
reins on his intuitive—Prince of Wands—aspect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, maybe,&quot; Drake said calmly. &quot;But suppose He was type A.
Now, if He got a transfusion at the last minute . . .&quot;</p>
<p>The nest was in sight. The bird was invisible, but Smiling Jim recognized the
characteristic eagle's nest on a peak only a few hundred yards above and to the
west. &quot;Come home, baby,&quot; he thought passionately, unstrapping his
rifle. &quot;Come home. Daddy is waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard took another belt of the brandy and repeated: &quot;The Saures were
not Illuminati. Neither were Weishaupt or Hitler. They were frauds, pure and
simple. First they deluded themselves, then they deluded others. The real
Illuminati, the A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.,</span></i>
have never been involved in politics or in any form of manipulating or coercing
people. Our interests are entirely elsewhere. <i>Do what thou wilt </i>is our
law. Only in the last few decades, as the fate of the earth seemed to be hanging
in the balance, have we taken any direct action. Even so, we have been cautious.
We know that power corrupts. We have acted chiefly by not-acting, by what the
Taoists call <i>wu-wei. </i>But then things got out of hand. They moved too fast
. . . We fucked up somewhat. But only because total inaction seemed to mean
total disaster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean you, as an official of some sort in the A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>,
infiltrated the fake Illuminati and became one of their top Five, intending to
undo them nonviolently? And it didn't work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It worked about as well as any activity on that level ever works,&quot;
Hagbard said somberly. &quot;Most of humanity has been spared, for a while. And
the wild free animals have been spared. For a while.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I
guess I'll have to begin from the A-B-Cs. We have never sought power. We have
sought to disperse power, to set men and women free. That really means: to help
them to discover that they are free. Everybody's free. The slave is free. The
ultimate weapon isn't this plague out in Vegas, or any new super H-bomb. The
ultimate weapon has always existed. Every man, every woman, and every child owns
it. It's the ability to say <i>No </i>and take the consequences. 'Fear is
failure.' 'The fear of death is the beginning of slavery.' &quot;Thou hast no
right but to do thy will.' The goose can break the bottle at any second.
Socrates took the hemlock to prove it. Jesus went to the cross to prove it. It's
in all history, all myth, all poetry. It's right out in the open all the
time.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard sighed again. &quot;Our founder and leader, the man known in myth as
Prometheus or the snake in the garden of Eden—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Christ,&quot; Joe said, slumping forward in his seat. &quot;I have
the feeling that you're starting to put me on again. You're about to tell me
that the Prometheus and Genesis stories are really based on fact.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our leader, known as Lucifer or Satan,&quot; Hagbard went on,
&quot;Lucifer being the <i>bringer of light—&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;You know,&quot; Joe said, &quot;I'm not going to believe a word of
this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our leader, known as Prometheus the fire-bringer or Lucifer the
light-bringer or Quetzalcoatl the morning star or the snake in the garden of
Osiris's bad brother, Set, or Shaitan the tempter—well, to be brief, he
repented.&quot; Hagbard raised an eyebrow. &quot;Does that intrigue you
sufficiently to silence your skepticism long enough for me to finish a
sentence?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He <i>repented?&quot; </i>Joe sat upright again.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. Why not?&quot; Hagbard's old malicious grin, so rare in the last
week, returned. &quot;If Atlas can Shrug and Telema-chus can Sneeze, why can't
Satan Repent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Joe said. &quot;This is just another one of your
put-ons, but I'm hooked. I'll listen. But I have my own answer, which is that
there is no answer. You're just an allegory on the universe itself, and every
explanation of you and your actions is incomplete. They'll always be a new, more
up-to-date explanation coming along a while later. That's <i>my </i>answer.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed easily. &quot;Charming,&quot; he said. &quot;I must remember
that the next time <i>I'm </i>trying to understand myself. Of course, it's true
of any human being. We're all allegories on the universe, different faces it
wears in trying to decide what it really is ... But our founder and leader, as <i>I
</i>was saying, repented. That's the secret that has never been revealed. There
is no stasis anywhere in the cosmos, least of all in the minds of entities that
possess minds. The basic fallacy of all bad writers—and theologians are
notoriously bad writers—is to create cardboard characters who never change. He
gave us the light of reason and, seeing how we misused it, he repented. The
story is more complicated, but that's the basic outline. At least, it's as much
as I understood until a week ago. The important thing to get clear is that he
never aimed at power or destruction. That's a myth—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Created by the opposition,&quot; Joe said. &quot;Right? I read that in
Mark Twain's defense of Satan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twain was subtle,&quot; Hagbard said, taking a little more brandy,
&quot;but not subtle enough. No, the myth was not created by the opposition. It
was created by our founder himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wilde should be alive,&quot; Joe said admiringly. &quot;He was so proud
of himself, setting paradox on top of paradox until he had a nice three- or
four- or five-story house of contradictions built up. He should see the
skyscrapers you create.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You never disappoint me,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;If they ever hang
you, you'll be arguing about whether the rope really exists until the last
minute. That's why I picked you, all those years ago, and programmed you for the
role you'd play tonight. Only a man whose father was an ex-Moslem, and who was
himself an ex-Catholic and an ex-engineering student, would have the required
complexity. Anyway, to return to the libretto, as an old friend of mine used to
say, the error of Weishaupt and Hitler and Stalin and the Saures was to believe
the propaganda our founder spread against himself—that, and believing they
were in communication with him, when they were only in communication with a
nasty part of their own unconscious minds. There was no evil spirit misleading
them. They were misleading themselves. And we were trailing along behind, trying
to keep them from causing too much harm. Finally, in the early 1960s—after a
certain fuckup in Dallas convinced me that things were getting out of hand—I
contacted the Five directly. Since I knew the real secrets of magic and they
only</p>
<p>had distortions, it was easy to convince them that I was an emissary from
those beings whom they call the Secret Chiefs or the Great Old Ones or the
Shining Ones. Being half crazy, they reacted in a way I had not expected. They
all abdicated and appointed me and the four Saures as their successors. They
decided that we're entering the age of Horus, the child-god, and that youth
should be given a chance to run things—hence, the promotion of the Saures.
They threw me in because I seemed to know what I was talking about. But then
came the real problem: I couldn't convince the Saures of anything. Those
pig-headed kids wouldn't believe a word I said. They told me I was over thirty
and untrustworthy. I told you the truth was out in the open all the time;
anybody with eyes in his head should have been able to interpret what's been
happening since the early 1960s. The great and dreaded Illuminati of the past
had fallen into the control of a bunch of ignorant and malicious kids. The age
of the crowned and conquering child.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you think the old and wise should rule?&quot; Joe asked. &quot;That
doesn't fit your character. This <i>has </i>to be another put-on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think <i>anybody </i>should rule,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;All
I'm doing—all the Higher Order of the A <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype

ever tried to' do—is communicate with people, in spite of their biases and
fears. Not to rule them. And what we're trying to communicate—the ultimate
secret, the philosopher's stone, the elixir of life—is just the power of the
word <i>No. </i>We are people who have said <i>Non serviam, </i>and we're trying
to teach others to say it. Drake was one of us spiritually but never understood
it. If we can't find immortality, we can make a damned good try. If we can't
save this planet, we can get off it and go to the stars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what happens now?&quot; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&quot;More surprises,&quot; Hagbard answered promptly. &quot;I can't tell you
the whole story at this hour, with both of us fagged out at the end of an acid
trip. We go back to the hotel and sleep, and after breakfast there are more
revelations. For George as well as for you.&quot;</p>
<p>And later in the Bugatti, which, driven by Harry Coin, was grandly wafting
Hagbard, George, and Joe around the south side of Lake Totenkopf, George asked,
&quot;Is Hitler really going to be buried anonymously in a Jewish
cemetery?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It looks that way.&quot; Hagbard grinned. &quot;His Israeli documents
are excellent forgeries. He'll be lifted off that toilet by Hauptmann's men and
gently deposited in the Ingolstadt Hebrew Burial Grounds, there to rest for all
eternity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That will make me throw up once a day for the rest of my life,&quot;
Joe said bitterly. &quot;It's the worst case of cemetery desecration in
history.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it has a positive aspect,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Look at it from
the point of view of the Nazi leaders. Think how they'll hate being buried in a
Jewish cemetery with a rabbi praying over them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doesn't make up for it,&quot; said George. &quot;Joe's right. It's jn
terribly bad taste.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought both you guys were thoroughgoing atheists,&quot; said
Hagbard. &quot;If you are, you think the dead are dead and it hardly matters
where they're buried. What's happening —you both getting religion?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can think of nothing more likely to drive a man to religion than your
company,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Burying them Nazis with a bunch of Jews is the funniest thing I ever
heard,&quot; Harry Coin offered from the driver's seat.</p>
<p>&quot;Go bugger a dead goat, Coin,&quot; George called.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing,&quot; said Coin. &quot;Lead me to it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're incorrigible, Hagbard,&quot; said Joe. &quot;You really are
incorrigible. And you surround yourself with people who incorrige you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't need help,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;I have a great deal of
initiative. More than any other human being I know. With the possible exception
of Mavis.&quot;</p>
<p>George said, &quot;Hagbard, did I really see what I thought I saw last night?
Is Mavis really a goddess? Are Stella and Miss Mao and Mavis all the same
person, or was I just hallucinating?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here come the paradoxes,&quot; Joe groaned. &quot;Hell talk for an
hour, and we'll be more confused when he's finished.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard, who was sitting in a large swivel jump seat, swung round so he was
looking over Harry Coin's shoulder at the road ahead. &quot;I'd be glad to tell
you later, George. I would have told you now, except that I don't like Malik's
tone. He may not be intending to shoot me any more, but he still has it in for
me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You bet,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, are you still going to marry Mavis?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Hagbard swung round and stared at George with an expression
that was almost a perfect replica of genuine surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;You said that you and Mavis were going to be married aboard the <i>Leif
Erikson </i>by Miss Portinari. Are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;Miss Portinari will marry us later
today. Sorry, but I knew her first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then Mavis isn't really Eris?&quot; George persisted. &quot;She's just
a priestess of Eris?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard brushed the question away. &quot;Later, George. She will explain
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's even better at explanations than Hagbard is,&quot; Joe commented
cynically.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;getting back to Hitler and company, you
have to realize that they will know about it if their bodies are buried in a
Jewish cemetery. They are still conscious and aware, though they are not what we
would normally call alive. Their consciousness-energy is intact, though there is
no life in their bodies. They came to the Ingolstadt festival hoping that their
young leaders would give them immortality. They've achieved immortality, all
right But not a very nice kind. Their consciousness-energy has been gobbled up
by the Evil One. Their identities still survive, but they will be helpless parts
of the Eater of Souls, the foulest being in the universe, the only creature that
can turn spirit into carrion. Yog Sothoth has claimed his own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yog Sothoth!&quot; said Joe. &quot;I remember learning about Yog
Sothoth. It was an invisible being trapped in a pentagonal structure in
Atlantis. The original Illuminati blew up the structure and turned the creature
loose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, yes,&quot; Hagbard said, &quot;you saw that Erisian Liberation
Front training film about Atlantis and Grayface Gruad, didn't you? Well, of
course, the film isn't accurate in every respect. For instance, Yog Sothoth is
depicted as killing people by the thousands. Actually, most of the time, except
under very limited conditions, he has to have his killing done for him. That's
how human sacrifice originated. And it was to get his killing done for him that
he manipulated a great many events among the Atlanteans until old Gray-face, the
original moral sadomasochist, came along with his notions about good and evil.
Man suffers because he is evil, said Gruad, and because he is small and
helpless. There are vast powers in the universe, dwarfing us, who have to be
placated. Gruad taught man to see ignorance, passion, pain, and death as evils,
and to fight against them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well . . . ignorance is an evil,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Not when it can be acknowledged and accepted,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;In order to eat, you have to be hungry. In order to learn, you have to be
ignorant. Ignorance is a condition of learning. Pain is a condition of health.
Passion is a condition of thought. Death is a condition of life. When Gruad
taught his followers in Atlantis to see those conditions as evils, then he could
teach them human sacrifice, persecution, and warfare. Yog Sothoth taught Gruad
to teach his people those things, only Gruad never knew it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So Yog Sothoth is the serpent in the Garden of Eden,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;In a manner of speaking,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;But you understand,
the Garden of Eden myth was dreamed up and promulgated by the Illuminati.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who dreamed up the Gruad of Atlantis myth?&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that's true,&quot; said Hagbard solemnly.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the biggest bunch of bullshit I ever heard,&quot; said Joe.
&quot;You're trying to claim that there's no such thing as good and evil, that
the concepts were invented and taught to humans deliberately to fuck them up
psychologically. But in order to maintain that you have to postulate that the
condition of man before Gruad was good and that his condition afterward has been
evil. And you have to make Yog Sothoth into a carbon copy of Satan. You haven't
progressed one iota beyond the Judeo-Christian myth with that highfalutin'
science-fiction story.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard roared with laughter and slapped Joe on the knee.
&quot;Beautiful!&quot; He held up his hand in a distinctive gesture. &quot;What
I am doing?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You're giving the peace sign, only with your fingers together,&quot;
George said, confused.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what comes of being an ignorant Baptist.&quot; Joe laughed.
&quot;As a son of the True Church, I can tell you, George, that Hagbard is
giving a Catholic blessing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed?&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Look at the shadow my hand casts on
this book.&quot; He held up a book behind his hand, and they saw the head of a
horned Devil. &quot;The sun, source of all light and energy, symbol of
redemption. And my hand, in the most sacred gesture of benediction. Put them
both together, they spell Satan,&quot; he sang to an old tune.</p>
<p>&quot;And what the hell does that mean?&quot; Joe demanded. &quot;Evil is
only a shadow, a false appearance? The usual mystic mishmosh? Tell that to the
survivors of Auschwitz.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose,&quot; Hagbard said, &quot;I told you that good was only a
shadow, a false appearance? Several modern philosophers have argued that case
rather plausibly and earned themselves a reputation for hard-headed realism. And
yet that's just the mirror image of what you call the usual mystic
mishmosh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then what is real?&quot; George demanded. &quot;Mary, Queen of the May,
or Kali, Mother of Murderers, or Eris, who synthesizes both?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The <i>trip </i>is real,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;The images you
encounter along the way are all unreal. If you keep moving, and pass them, you
eventually discover that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Solipsism. Sophomore solipsism,&quot; Joe answered.</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; Hagbard grinned. &quot;The solipsist thinks the <i>tripper is
</i>real.&quot;</p>
<p>Harry Coin called out, &quot;Hagbard, there's a couple of guys up the road
flagging us down.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard turned and peered ahead. &quot;Right. They're crew members from the <i>Leif
Erikson. </i>Pull up where they tell you to, Harry.&quot; He reached up to a
silver vase mounted beside the back seat and took a pink rosebud out of the
fresh bouquet he had placed there that morning. He carefully inserted the
rosebud in the buttonhole of his lapel. The great golden Bugatti rolled to a
stop, and the four men got out. Harry patted its long front fender with a long,
skinny hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks for letting me drive this car, Hagbard,&quot; he said.
&quot;That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No it isn't. Now you'll want your own Bugatti. Or<b>, </b>what's worse,
you'll ask me to let you be my chauffeur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No I won't. But I'll do a deal with you. You let me have this car, and
whenever you want to go somewhere in it, I'll drive you.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed and slapped Coin on the back. &quot;You keep on showing that
much intelligence and you will end up owning one.&quot;</p>
<p>The long line of cars that had been following the Bugatti now were stopping
along the edge of the road behind it There was a stretch of lawn that sloped
gently down from the road to the lake. Out on the choppy blue water a round gold
buoy drifted, giving off a cloud of red smoke.</p>
<p>Stella stepped out of the Mercedes 600 that was parked behind the Bugatti.
George half expected Mavis and Miss Mao to get out with her, but there was no
sign of them. He looked at her and was unable to speak. He didn't know what to
say. She looked back at him with grave, sad eyes, in silence. Somehow, he
thought, it will all be different and better when we get down to the submarine.
In the submarine we'll be able to talk to each other.</p>
<p>A pink Cadillac behind the Mercedes disgorged Simon Moon and Clark Kent.
Stella did not turn to look at them. They were talking excitedly to each other.
A motorcycle pulled up behind the Cadillac. Otto Waterhouse climbed off it. Now
Stella turned and looked at Otto, then back to George. Otto looked at Stella,
then at George. Stella suddenly turned away from both of them and walked down to
the edge of the lake. A large inflated life-raft was pulled up on shore, and one
of Hagbard's men sitting in the raft stood up holding a wetsuit as Stella
approached. Slowly, as if she were all alone by the shore of the lake, Stella
took off her peasant blouse and skirt and continued stripping until she was
naked. Then she started to put on the wetsuit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another man got behind the wheel of Hag-bard's Bugatti Royale and
drove it across the lawn. Two other men held the mouth of a huge transparent
plastic bag far enough apart so that the car could be driven right into it. They
tied up the end of the bag with strong wire. Ropes attached to the bag grew
taut; their other ends disappeared into the water. Slowly, looking somewhat
majestic and somewhat ridiculous, the car slid across the lawn and into the
water. When it had been pulled out a short distance from shore it began to
float. Out of the deeper water popped two golden scuba-launches, Hagbard's men
in black wetsuits mounted in the saddles. The launches positioned themselves on
either side of the automobile in its plastic bubble and the men lashed the
launches and the car together with cables. Then they started their engines and
launches; men and car quickly sank out of sight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more rubber rafts pulled ashore, and all of Hagbard's people
started donning wetsuits distributed by the men from the submarine.</p>
<p>&quot;I've never done this before,&quot; said Lady Velkor. &quot;Are you sure
it's safe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry, baby,&quot; said Simon Moon. &quot;Even a man could do
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where's your friend, Mary Lou?&quot; George asked.</p>
<p>&quot;She left me,&quot; Simon said glumly. &quot;The damned acid fucked up
her mind.&quot;</p>
<p>NO—because in the long run whites and blacks and men and women have to come
to an understanding and an equality No because this split can't go on forever I
mean shit I understand that but No I can't not now No I am not ready yet the
penis I imagined I had last night was not just some Freudian hallucination
there's the phallic power behind the physical penis No the acting from the
center of the body what Simon says Hagbard calls acting from the heart and only
a few can have that right now No most of us haven't learned and haven't been
given a chance to learn That's the real castration the real impotence in both
men and women in both blacks and whites No the power that we think is phallic
because this is a patriarchal society No I can't be Simon's woman or anybody's
woman First I've got to be my own woman and it may take years it may take life I
may never achieve it but I've got to try I can't end up like Daddy I can't end
up like most blacks and most of the whites too end up No maybe I'll meet Simon
again maybe we can try a second time That acid nut Timothy Leary always said You
can be anything you want the second time around No it can't be this time it's
got to be the second time around No I said No I won't No</p>
<p>&quot;I hope to hell Hauptmann was telling the truth about not following
me,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;It's going to take time to get us all down
below.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are we doing with the cars?&quot; Harry Coin asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the Bugatti, obviously, is too beautiful for me to part with,
which is why I'm taking it aboard the <i>Leif Erik-son. </i>But the rest we'll
just leave. Maybe some of the people who went to the festival will be able to
use them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry about them Huns,&quot; said John-John Dillin-ger, strolling
up. &quot;Any of them give us trouble, we'll just reply with a few short sharp
words from old Mr. Thompson. Leave 'em in stitches.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Peace, it's wonderful,&quot; said Hagbard sourly.</p>
<p>&quot;Give it a chance,&quot; said Malaclypse, still in the guise of</p>
<p>Jean-Paul Sartre. &quot;It needs time to spread. The absence of the
Illuminati has to make itself felt. It <i>will </i>make a difference.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt it,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;The Dealy Lama was right all
along.&quot;</p>
<p>The entire operation of outfitting Hagbard's people with wetsuits, paddling
them out to the scuba-launches, and transporting them down to the <i>Leif
Erikson </i>took more than an hour. When it was George's turn he looked eagerly
into the depths for the <i>Leif Erikson </i>and was happy when he saw it glowing
below him like a great golden blimp. Well, at least that's real, he thought. I'm
approaching it from the outside, and it's just as big as I think it is. Even if
it doesn't go anywhere and this is all happening in Disney World.</p>
<p>An hour later the submarine was deep in the Sea of Valusia. George, Joe, and
Hagbard stood on the bridge, Hag-bard leaning against the ancient Viking prow,
George and Joe peering into the endless gray depths, watching the strange blind
fishes and monsters swim by.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a type of fungus that has evolved into something resembling
seaweed in this ocean,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;It's luminescent. There's no
light down here, so no green plants grow.&quot;</p>
<p>A dot appeared in the distance and grew rapidly in size until George
recognized a porpoise, doubtless Howard. There was scuba-diving equipment
strapped to the animal's back. When he had come alongside he turned a
somersault, and his translated voice started to come through the loudspeaker in
a song:</p>
<p>When he swims the oceans spill, He can start earthquakes at will, He lived
when the earth was desolate, I sing Leviathan the great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hagbard shook his head. &quot;That doggerel is just awful. I'm going to have
to do something about FUCKUP'S ability to translate poetry. What are you talking
about, Howard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aha,&quot; said Joe. &quot;I didn't get a look at your talking porpoise
friend last time I was aboard. Hello, Howard, I'm Joe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Joe,&quot; said Howard. &quot;Welcome to my world.
Unfortunately, it's not a very hospitable world at the moment.</p>
<p>There is grave danger in the Atlantic. The true ruler of the Illuminati is on
the prowl on the high seas—Leviathan himself. The land is collapsing beside
the Pacific, and the tremors have made the earth shake, and Leviathan is
disturbed and has risen from the depths. Besides the trembling of the lands and
seas, he knows that his chief worshippers, the Illuminati, are dead. He had read
their passing in the pulsings of consciousnes-energy that reach even into the
depths of the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he can't eat the submarine,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;And we're
well armed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He can crack the submarine open as easily as a gull cracks a penguin's
egg,&quot; said Howard. &quot;And your weapons will bother him not at all. He's
virtually indestructible.&quot; Hagbard shrugged, while Joe and George looked
askance at each other. &quot;I'll be careful, Howard. But we can't turn around
now. We've got to get back to North America. We'll try to evade Leviathan if we
see him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He fills the whole ocean,&quot; said Howard. &quot;No matter what you
do, you'll see him, and he'll see you.&quot; &quot;You're exaggerating.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only slightly. I must bid you farewell now. I think we've done a good
week's work, and the menace to my people recedes even as does the danger to
yours. Our porpoise horde is scattering and leaving by different exits into the
North Atlantic. I'm getting out of the Sea of Valusia by way of Scotland. We
think Leviathan will head south around Cape Horn into the Pacific. Everything
that swims and is hungry is going that way. There's a lot of fresh meat in the
water, I'm sorry to say. Good-bye, friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So long, Howard,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;That was a good bridge you
helped me build.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it was,&quot; said Howard. 'Too bad you had to sink it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What were those tanks on Howard's back?&quot; said Joe. &quot;Scuba
gear,&quot; said George. &quot;There's no air available in the Sea of Valusia,
so Howard has to have breathing equipment till he can get to the open ocean.
Hagbard, what was that business about the true ruler of the Illuminati? I've
heard again and again that there were five Illuminati Primi. Four of them were
the Saure family. That leaves one. Is it Leviathan? Is the whole show being run
by a sea monster? Is that the big secret?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;You have yet to figure out who the fifth
Illuminatus Primus is.&quot; He threw Joe a wink that George missed. &quot;By
true ruler Howard meant a godlike being whom the Illuminati worship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A sea monster?&quot; said Joe. &quot;There was a hint about a sea
monster of enormous size and power in that movie those people showed me in that
loft on the Lower East Side. But the original Illuminati—Gruad's bunch—were
portrayed as sun worshippers. That big pyramid with the eye in it was supposed
to be the sun god's eye. Who the hell were those people with the movie, anyway?
I know who Miss Mao is now, but I still don't know who they were.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Members of the Erisian Liberation Front—ELF,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;They have a somewhat different view of the prehistory and origins of the
Illuminati than we do. One thing we both agree upon is that the Illuminati
invented religion.&quot; &quot;The Original Sin, right?'-' said Joe
sardonically. &quot;Joe, you ought to start a religion yourself,&quot; said
Hagbard. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you are so skeptical.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're going back to America, huh?&quot; said George. &quot;And the
adventure is more or less over?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This phase of it, at least,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Good. I want to
try to write about what I've seen and what has happened to me. I'll see you guys
later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's to be a magnificent dinner tonight in the main dining
salon,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>Joe said, &quot;Don't forget, <i>Confrontation </i>has a first option on
anything you write.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck you,&quot; George's voice came back as the door of the bridge
closed behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;Wish I had something better to do than this. Gimme two,&quot; said Otto
Waterhouse.</p>
<p>&quot;You do, don't you?&quot; said Harry Coin. &quot;Ain't that Nigra gal,
Stella, your gal? Why ain't you with her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because she doesn't exist,&quot; said Otto, picking up the two cards
John-John Dillinger had slid across the polished teak-wood table to him. He
studied his hand for a moment, then threw a five-ton flax note into the pot.
&quot;Any more than Mavis or Miss Mao exists. There's a woman somewhere under
all of those identities, but everything I've experienced has been a
hallucination.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There isn't a woman in the world you couldn't say that about,&quot;
said Dillinger. &quot;How many cards you want, Harry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Three,&quot; said Harry. &quot;This is a lousy hand you dealt me,
John-John. Come to think of it, you're hallucinatin' all the time when you have
sex. That's what makes it good. And that's how come I can fuck anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll just take one,&quot; said Dillinger. &quot;Dealt myself a pretty
good hand. What do you see when you're fucking trees and little boys and
whatnot, Harry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A white light,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Just a big beautiful clear white
light. I'll throw in ten tons of flax this time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Must be your hand isn't so lousy after all,&quot; said Water-house.</p>
<p>&quot;Come in,&quot; said George. The stateroom door opened, and he put down
his pen. It was Stella.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a little problem, don't we, George?&quot; she said, coming into
the room and sitting beside him on the bed. &quot;I think you're angry at
me,&quot; she went on, putting her hand on his knee. &quot;You feel like this
identity of mine is a sham. So, in a sense, I was deceiving you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've lost you and Mavis both,&quot; said George. &quot;You're both the
same person—which means you're really neither. You're immortal. You're not
human; I don't know what you are.&quot; Suddenly he looked at her hopefully.
&quot;Unless that was all a hallucination last night. Could it have been the
acid? Can you really change into different people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mavis.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't do that,&quot; said George. &quot;It upsets me too much.&quot; He
darted a little glance to his side. It was Stella.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't really understand why it bothers me so much,&quot; said George.
&quot;I ought to be able to take everything in stride by now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did it ever bother you that you were in love with Mavis, besides being
in love with me?&quot; said Stella.</p>
<p>&quot;Not much. Because it hardly ever seemed to bother you. But I know why
now. How could you be jealous when you and Mavis were the same person?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're not the same person, really.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you ever read <i>The Three Faces of Eve? </i>Listen . . .&quot;</p>
<p>Like all the best love stories, it began in Paris. She was well-known as a
Hollywood actress (and was actually an Illuminatus); he was becoming fairly
famous as a jet-set millionaire (and was actually a smuggler and anarchist).
Envision Bogart and Bergman in the flashback sequences from <i>Casablanca. </i>It
was like that: a passion so intense, a Paris so beautiful (recovering from the
war it had been slipping toward in the Bogart-Bergman epic), a couple so radiant
that any observer with an eye for nuance would have foretold a storm ahead. It
came the night he confessed he was a magician and made a certain proposal to
her; she left him at once. A month later, back in Beverly Hills, she realized
that what he had asked was her destiny. When she tried to find him—as often
happened with Hagbard Celine—he had dropped from public view, leaving his
businesses in other hands temporarily, and was <i>in camera.</i></p>
<p>A year later she heard that he was again a public figure, hobnobbing with
English businessmen of questionable reputation and even more dubious Chinese
import-export executives in Hong Kong. She violated her contract with the
biggest studio in Hollywood and flew to the Crown colony, only to find he had
dropped from sight again, while his recent friends were being investigated for
involvement in the heroin business.</p>
<p>She found him in Tokyo, at the Imperial Hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;A year ago, I decided to accept your proposal,&quot; she told him,
&quot;but now, after Hong Kong, I'm not so sure.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Thelema,&quot; </i>he said, facing her across a room that seemed
designed for Martians; it had actually been designed for Welshmen.</p>
<p>She sat down abruptly on a couch. &quot;You're in the Order?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the Order and against the Order,&quot; he said. &quot;The real
purpose is to destroy them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm one of the top Five in the United States,&quot; she said
unsteadily. &quot;What makes you think I'll turn on them now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thelema,&quot; he repeated. &quot;It's not just a password. It means <i>Will&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot; </i>The Order is&quot; my Will.'&quot; She quoted from Weishaupt's
original Oath of Initiation.</p>
<p>&quot;If you really believed that, you wouldn't be here,&quot; he said.
&quot;You're talking to me because part of you knows that a human being's Will
is never in an external organization.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You sound like a moralist. That's odd—for a heroin merchant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You sound like a moralist, too, and that's very odd—for a servant of
Agharti.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody joins <i>that lot,&quot; </i>she said with a pert Cockney
accent, &quot;without being a moralist to start with.&quot; They both laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;I was right about you,&quot; Hagbard said.</p>
<p><i>But, George interrupted, is he really in the heroin business? That's
dirty.</i></p>
<p><i>You sound like a moralist too, she said. It's part of his Demonstration.
Any government could put him out of business within their borders—as England
has done—by legalizing junk. So long as they refuse to do that, there's a
black market. He won't let the Mafia monopolize it—he makes sure the black
market is a free market. If it wasn't for him a lot of junkies who are alive
today would be dead of contaminated heroin. But let me go on with the story.</i></p>
<p>They rented a villa in Naples to begin the transformation. For a month the
only humans she saw—aside from Hagbard—were two servants named Sade and
Masoch (she later learned that their real names were Eichmann and Cal-ley). They
began each day by serving her breakfast and quarreling. The first day, Sade
argued for materialism and Masoch for idealism; the second day, Sade expounded
fascism and Masoch communism; the third day, Sade insisted on cracking eggs from
the big end and Masoch was equally vehement about the little end. All the
debates were on a high and lofty intellectual level, verbally, but seemed absurd
because of the simple fact that Sade and Masoch always wore clown suits. The
fourth day, they argued for and against abortion; the fifth day, for and against
mercy-killing; the sixth day, for and against the proposition &quot;Life is
worth living.&quot; She became more and more aware of the time and money Hagbard
had spent in training and preparing them: Each argued with the skill of a
first-rate trial lawyer and had a phalanx of carefully researched facts to
support his position—and yet the clown suits made it hard to take either of
them seriously. The seventh morning, they argued theism versus atheism; the
eighth morning, the individual versus the State; the ninth, whether wearing
shoes was or was not a sexual perversion. All arguments began to seem equally
insubstantial. The tenth morning, they feuded over realism versus antinomianism;
the eleventh, whether the statement &quot;All statements are relative&quot; is
or is not self-contradictory; the twelfth, whether a man who sacrifices his life
for his country is or is not insane: the fifteenth, whether spaghetti or Dante
had had the greater influence on the Italian national character . . .</p>
<p>But that was only the start of the day. After breakfast fin her bedroom,
where every article of furniture was gold but only vaguely rounded) she went to
Hagbard's study (where everything looked <i>exactly </i>like a golden apple) and
watched documentary films concerning the early matriarchal stage of Greek
culture. At ten random intervals the name &quot;Ens&quot; would be called; if
she remembered to respond, a chocolate candy arrived from a wall shoot. At ten
other random intervals, her own name was called; if she responded to this, she
received a mild electric shock. After the tenth day the system was changed and
intensified: The shock was stronger if she responded to her previous name,
whereas if she responded to &quot;Eris&quot; Hagbard immediately entered and
balled her.</p>
<p>During lunch (which always ended with golden <i>apfel-strudel), </i>Galley
and Eichmann danced for her, a complex ballet which Hagbard called
&quot;Hodge-Podge&quot;; as many times as she saw this, she never was able to
determine how they changed costumes at the climax, in which Hodge became Podge
and Podge became Hodge.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Hagbard came to her suite and gave lessons in yoga,
concentrating on <i>pranayama, </i>with some training in <i>asana. </i>&quot;The
important thing is not being able to stand so still that you can balance a
saucer of sulphuric acid on your head without getting hurt,&quot; he stressed.
&quot;The important thing is knowing what each muscle is doing, if it must be
doing something.&quot;</p>
<p>In the evenings they went to a small chapel that had been part of the villa
for centuries. Hagbard had removed all Christian decorations and redesigned it
in classical Greek with a traditional magic pentagram on the floor. She sat, in
the full lotus, within the internal pentagon, while Hagbard danced insanely
around the five points (he was totally stoned), calling upon Eris.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of what you're doing seems scientific,&quot; she told him after
five days, &quot;but some is plain damnfoolishness.&quot; &quot;If the science
fails,&quot; he replied, &quot;the damnfoolishness may work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But last night you had me in that pentagon for three hours while you
called on Eris. And she didn't come.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She will,&quot; Hagbard said darkly. &quot;Before the month is over.
We're just establishing the foundation this week, laying down the proper lines
of word and image and emotional energy.&quot;</p>
<p>During the second week she was convinced Hagbard was quite mad as she watched
him prance and caper like a goat around the five points, shouting, <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

<img src="1.htm29.jpg" alt="1-1.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027" width="201" height="21">in
the flickering candlelight and amid the heavy bouquet of burning incense and
hemp. But at the end of that week she was responding to her former name exactly
0 percent of the time and responding to &quot;Eris&quot; exactly 100 percent of
the time. &quot;The conditioning is working better than the magic,&quot; she
said on the fifteenth day.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you really think there's a difference?&quot; he asked curiously.</p>
<p>That night she felt the air in the chapel change in a strange way during his
dancing invocations.</p>
<p>&quot;Something's happening,&quot; she said involuntarily—but he replied
only &quot;Quiet,&quot; and continued, more loudly and insanely, to call upon
Eris. The phenomenon—the <i>tingle—</i>remained, but nothing else happened.
&quot;What was it?&quot; she asked later.</p>
<p>&quot;Some call it Orgone and some call it the Holy Ghost,&quot; he said
briefly. &quot;Weishaupt called it the Astral Light. The reason the Order is so
fucked up is that they've lost contact with it.&quot;</p>
<p>The following days Sade and Masoch argued whether God was male or female,
whether God was sexed at all or neutral, whether God was an entity or a verb,
whether R. Buckminster. Fuller really existed or was a technocratic solar myth,
and whether human language was capable of containing truth. Nouns, adjectives,
adverbs—all parts of speech—were losing meaning for her as these clowns
endlessly debated the basic axioms of ontology and epistemolo-gy. Meanwhile, she
was no longer rewarded for answering to the name Eris, but only for acting like
Eris, the imperious and somewhat nutty goddess of a people as far gone in
matriarchy as the Jews were in patriarchy. Hagbard, in turn, became so
submissive as to border on masochism.</p>
<p>&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; she objected once, &quot;you're becoming . .
. effeminate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eris can be ... somewhat 'adjusted' ... to modern notions of decorum
after we've invoked Her,&quot; he said calmly. &quot;First we must have Her
here. <i>My Lady,&quot; </i>he added obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm beginning to see why you had to pick an actress for this,&quot; she
said a few days later, after a bit of Method business had won her an extra
reward. She was, in fact, beginning to feel like Eris as well as act like her.</p>
<p>&quot;The only other candidates—if I couldn't get you—were two other
actresses and a ballerina,&quot; he replied. &quot;Actually, any strong-willed
woman would do, but it would take much longer without previous theatrical
training.&quot;</p>
<p>Books about matriarchy began to supplement the films: Diner's <i>Mothers and
Amazons, </i>Bachofen, Engels, Mary Renault, Morgan, lan Suttie's <i>The Origins
of Love and Hale, </i>Robert Graves in horse-doctor's doses—<i>The White
Goddess, The Black Goddess, Hercules My Shipmate, Watch the North Wind Rise. </i>She
began to see that matriarchy made as much sense as patriarchy; Hagbard's
exaggerated deference toward her began to appear natural; she was far gone on a
power trip. The invocations grew wilder and more frantic. Sade and Masoch were
brought into the chapel to assist with demonaic music performed on a tom-tom and
an ancient Greek pipe, they ate hashish cakes before the invocation now and she
couldn't remember afterward exactly what had happened, the voice of the male
called upward to her, &quot;Mother! Creator! Ruler! Come to me!</p>
<p>Come to me!<b> </b>Come to me! <i>Ave, Discordia! Ave, Magna Mater!
Venerandum, vente, vente!</i></p>
<p>Thou hornless ever reborn one! Thou deathless ever-dying one! Come to me as
Isis and Artemis and Aphrodite, come as Helen, as Hera, come especially as
Eris!&quot;</p>
<p>She was bathing in the rockpool when he appeared, the blood of slain deer and
rabbits on his robe— She spoke the word and Hagbard was stricken— As he fell
forward his hands became hooves, antlers sprouted from his head —His own dogs
could eat him, she didn't care, the hemp smell in the room was gagging her, the
tom-tom beat was maddening. She was rising out of the waves, proud of her
nudity, riding on the come-colored pearls of foam. He was carrying her back to
her bed, murmuring, &quot;My Lady, my Lady.&quot; She was the Hag, wandering the
long Nile, weeping, seeking the fragments of his lost body as they passed the
closet and the window; he placed her head gently on the pillow. &quot;We almost
made it,&quot; he said. &quot;Tomorrow night, maybe . . .&quot;</p>
<p>They were back in the chapel, a whole day must have passed, and she sat
immobile in full lotus doing the <i>pranay-ama </i>breathing while he danced and
chanted and the weird music of the pipe and tom-tom worked on every conditioned
reflex that told her she was not American but Greek, not of this age but of a
past age, not woman but goddess . . . the White Light came as a series of
orgasms and stars going nova, she half felt the body of light coming forth from
the body of fire . . . and all three of them were sitting by her bed, watching
her gravely, as sunlight came flowing through the window.</p>
<p>Her first word was crude and angry.</p>
<p>&quot;Shit. Is it always going to be like that—a white epileptic spasm and
a hole in time? Won't I ever be able to remember it?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed. &quot;I put on my trousers one leg at a time,&quot; he said,
&quot;and I don't pull the corn up by its stalks to help it grow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can the Taoism and give me a straight answer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remembering is just a matter of smoothing the transitions,&quot; he
said. &quot;Yes, you'll remember. And control it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're a madman,&quot; she replied wearily. &quot;And you're leading me
into your own mad universe. I don't know why I still love you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We love him, too,&quot; Sade interjected helpfully. &quot;And we don't
know why either. We don't even have sex as an excuse.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard lit one of his foul Sicilian cigars. &quot;You think I just laid my
trip on your head,&quot; he said. &quot;It's more than that, much more. Eris is
an eternal possibility of human nature. She exists quite apart from your mind or
mine. And she is the one possibility that the Illuminati cannot cope with. What
we started here last night—with Pavlovian conditioning that's considered
totalitarian and ancient magic that's believed to be mere superstition—will
change the course of history and make real liberty and real rationality possible
at last. Maybe this dream of mine <i>is </i>madness—but if I lay it on enough
people it will be sanity, by definition, because it will be statistically
normal. We've just started, with me programming the trip for you. The next step
is for you to become a self-programmer.&quot;</p>
<p><i>And he told the truth, Stella said. I did become a self-programmer. The
three that you know were all my creations. Possibilities within me, women I
could have become, anyway, if genes and environment had been only slightly
different. Just small adjustments in the biogram and logogram.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Holy Mother,&quot; George said hollowly. It seemed the only appropriate
comment.</p>
<p>&quot;The only other detail,&quot; she went on calmly, &quot;was arranging a
convincing suicide. That took a while. But it was done, and my old identity
officially ceased to exist.&quot; She changed to her original form.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; George said, reeling. &quot;It can't be. I used to jack
off over pictures of you when I was a little boy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you disappointed that I'm so much older than you thought?&quot; Her
eyes crinkled in amusement. He looked into those suddenly
thirty-thousand-year-old eyes of one manifestation of Lilith Velkor and all the
arguments of Sade and Masoch appeared clownish and he looked through those eyes
and saw himself and Joe and Saul and even Hagbard as mere men and all their
attitudes as merely manly, and he saw the eternal womanly rebuttal, and he saw
beyond and above that the eternal divine amusement, he looked into those eyes of
amusement, those ancient glittering eyes so gay, and he said, sincerely,
&quot;Hell, I can never be disappointed about anything, ever again.&quot;
(George Dorn entered Nirvana, parenthetically.)</p>
<p>All categories collapsed, including the all-important distinction, which
Masoch and Sade had never argued, between science fiction and serious
literature. No because Daddy and Mommy were always just that Daddy and Mommy and
never once did they become for a change Mommy and Daddy do you dig that
important difference? do you dig difference? do you dig the lonely voice when
you're lost out here shouting &quot;me&quot; &quot;me&quot; <i>justme</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;I </i>can never be disappointed about anything, ever again,&quot;
George Dorn said, coming back.</p>
<p>&quot;The only other time that happened,&quot; he added thoughtfully,
&quot;the only other time I had the feminine viewpoint, I blocked it out of my
memory. That was my repression. That was the Primal Scene in this whole puzzle.
That was when I really lost identity with the Ringmaster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Raise you five,&quot; said Waterhouse, throwing down another five-ton
note. &quot;I killed seven members of my own race, and I remember the names of
every one of them: Mark Sanders, Fred Robinson, Donald MacArthur, Ponell Scott,
Anthony Rogers, Mary Keating, and David J. Monroe. And then I killed Milo A.
Flanagan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't know,&quot; said Harry Coin. &quot;Maybe I killed a lot
of famous people. But I also got reason to think I may of not killed anybody.
And I don't know which is worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish somebody would tell me I hadn't killed anybody,&quot; said
Waterhouse. &quot;Are you guys going to meet me or what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to kill Wolfgang Saure, and I did kill Wolfgang Saure,&quot;
said John-John Dillinger. &quot;If that brings evil upon me, so be it.&quot; He
threw down a five.</p>
<p>&quot;It may bring suffering rather than evil,&quot; said Water-house.
&quot;I have just one consolation. The first seven I killed because the Chicago
cops made me. The last I killed under orders from the Legion.&quot;</p>
<p>Harry Coin looked at him open-mouthed. &quot;I was gonna fold, but I just
changed my mind. You ain't so smart.&quot; He threw down a ten-ton note.
&quot;I'll raise you five and see you. Do you really believe that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I do. What are you talking about?&quot; Otto threw down
another five.</p>
<p>Dropping his own five-ton note on the table, Dillinger shook his head.
&quot;Golly. They left you out in the cold <i>way </i>too long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Four sevens,&quot; said Otto angrily, spreading his cards out.</p>
<p>&quot;Shit!&quot; said Harry Coin. &quot;All I got's a pair of fours and a
pair of nines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shame to waste a hand like this beating crap like that,&quot; said
John-John Dillinger grandly. He spread out his cards —the eight, nine, ten,
princess, and queen of swords—and scooped up the pot.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the story of the development of the soul,&quot; Miss Portinari was
saying at that moment, spreading out the twenty-two trumps or &quot;keys&quot;
of that very ancient deck. &quot;We call it a book—<i>the </i>Book of
Thoth—and it's the most important book in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>George and Joe Malik, each wondering if this was a final explanation or a new
put-on leading to a new cycle of deceptions, listened with mingled curiosity and
skepticism.</p>
<p>&quot;The order was deliberately reversed,&quot; Miss Portinari went on.
&quot;Not by the true sages. By the false Illuminati, and by all the other White
Brotherhoods and Rosicrucians and Freemasons and whatnot who didn't really
understand the truth and therefore wanted to hide the part of it they did
understand. They felt themselves threatened; the real sage is never threatened.
They spoke in symbols and paradoxes, like the real sages, but for a different
reason. They didn't know what the symbols and paradoxes meant. Instead of
following the finger that points to the moon, they sat down and worshipped the
finger itself. Instead of following the map, they thought it was the territory
and tried to live in it. Instead of reading the menu, they tried to eat it. Dig?
They had the levels confused. And they tried to confuse any independent searcher
by drawing more veils and paradoxes across the path. Finally, in the 1920s, some
real left-handed monkey wrenches in one of these mystic lodges recruited Adolph
Hitler, and he not only read the book backward, like all of them, but insisted
on believing it was the story of the exterior, physical universe.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, let me show you. The last card, Trump 21, is really the first.
It's where we all start from.&quot; She held up the card known as the World.
&quot;This is the Abyss of Hallucinations. This is where our attention is
usually focused. It is entirely constructed by our senses and our projected
emotions, as modern psychology and ancient Buddhism both testify—but it is
what most people call 'reality.' They are conditioned to accept it, and not to
inquire further, because only in this dream-walking state can they be governed
by those who wish to govern.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Portinari held up the next card, the Last Judgment. &quot;Key 20, or
Trump 20, or Atu 20, whichever terminology you prefer. It's actually second.
This is the nightmare to which the soul awakes if it begins, even in the
slightest, to question reality as defined by society. When you discover, for
instance, that you're not heterosexual but heterosexual-homosexual, not obedient
but obedient-rebellious, not loving but loving-hating. And that society is not
wise, orderly, just, and decent but wise-stupid, orderly-chaotic, just-unjust,
and decent-indecent. This is an internal discovery— this whole trip is an
internal voyage—and this is really the second stage. But if one thinks of the
story as the story of the external world, and if the order is reversed, this
comes as the penultimate Armageddon with Trump 21, the World, being the Kingdom
of Saints. The error of the apocalyptic sects, and of the Illuminati from
Weishaupt to Hitler, leading to an attempt to actually carry it out, with ovens
for the Jews and gypsies and other 'inferiors' and the promise of a Brave New
World for the purs, faithful, and Aryan afterward. Do you see what I mean about
confusing the map with the territory?</p>
<p>&quot;The next card is the Sun, which really means Osiris Risen—or, in
terms of the offshot of the Osirian religion most popular in the last two
millenniums, Jesus Risen. This is what happens if you survive the Last Judgment,
or Dark Night of the Soul, without becoming some kind of fanatic or lunatic.
Eventually, if you miss those attractive and pernicious alternatives, the
redemptive force appears: the internal Sun. Once again, if you project this
outward and think that the Sun in the sky, or some Sunlike divine man, has
redeemed you, you can lapse into lunacy or fanaticism. In Hitler's case it was
Karl Haushofer, or Wotan appearing in the form of Karl Haushofer. For most of
the nuts you meet handing out tracts on the street, it's Jesus, or Jehovah
appearing in the form of Jesus. For Elijah Mohammed, it was W. D. Fard, or Allah
appearing in the form of W. D. Fard. So it goes. Those who do not confuse the
levels realize it's the redemptive force within themselves and pass on —to Key
18, the Moon . . .&quot;</p>
<p>The next half-hour passed rapidly—so rapidly that Joe wondered afterward if
Miss Portinari had slipped them still another drug, one that speeded time up as
much as psychedelics slowed it down.</p>
<p>&quot;Last,&quot; Miss Portinari said finally, &quot;is the Fool, Key 0. He
walks over the edge of the cliff, careless of the danger. The wind blows wither
it will; even so are all they that are reborn of the Spirit.' In short, he has
conquered Death. Nothing can frighten him, and he can never be enslaved. It's
the end of the trip, and keeping humanity from getting there is the chief
business of every governing group.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that's it,&quot; Joe said. &quot;Twenty-two stages. Not
twenty-three. Thank God we got away from Simon's Magic Number for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Miss Portinari said, <i>&quot;Tarot </i>is an anagram on <i>rota,
</i>remember? The extra <i>t </i>reminds you that the Wheel turns back to rejoin
itself. There is a twenty-third s^ep, and it's right where you started, only now
you face it without fear.&quot; She held up the World again. &quot;At first,
mountains are mountains. Then mountains are no longer mountains. Finally
mountains are mountains again. Only the name of the voyager has changed to
preserve his Innocence.&quot; She pushed the cards together and stacked them
neatly. &quot;There are a million other holy books, in words and pictures and
even in music, and they all tell the same story. The most important lesson of
all, the one that explains all the horrors and miseries of the world, is that
you can get off the Wheel at any point and declare the trip is over. That's okay
for any given man or woman, if their ambitions are modest. The trouble starts
when, out of fear of further movement —out of fear of growth, out of fear of
change, out of fear of Death, out of any kind of fear—such a person tries to
stop the Wheel literally, by stopping everybody else. That's when the two great
bum trips begin: Religion and Government. The only religion consistent with the
whole Wheel is private and personal; the only government consistent with it is
self-government. Whoever tries to lay his trip on others is acting from terror,
and will soon resort to terror as a weapon if the others won't accept the trip
through persuasion. Nobody who understands the whole Wheel will do that,
however, for such people understand that every man and every woman and every
child is the Self-Begotten One—Jesus motherfucking Christ, in Harry's gorgeous
brand of English.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; George asked, frowning, &quot;hasn't Hagbard been trying
pretty hard to lay his trip on everybody? At least lately?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Miss Portinari said. &quot;In self-defense, and in defense
of all life on earth, he broke the basic rule of wisdom. He fully expects to pay
for that violation. We are waiting for the bill to be presented. I, personally,
do not think that we will have to wait very long.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe frowned. A half-hour had passed since Miss Portinari had spoken those
words; why should he remember them so vividly right now? He was on the bridge,
about to ask Hag-bard a question, but he couldn't remember the question or how
he had gotten there. On the TV receptor he saw a long tendril, thin as a wire,
brush against the side of a globe, trailing off into invisible distances. That
meant it was actually touching the side of the submarine. The tendril
disappeared. Must be some sort of seaweed, Joe thought. He resumed his
conversation with Hagbard. &quot;The squizfardle on the humits is warb,&quot; he
said.</p>
<p>The tendril was back, and another one with it. This time they stayed, and Joe
could see more in the distance. We must have run into a whole clump of seaweed,
he thought. Then an enormous tentacle came zooming up out of the depths.</p>
<p>Hagbard saw it and crouched, gripping the rail of the Viking prow. &quot;Hang
on!&quot; he yelled, and Joe dropped to his knees beside him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, below, above, and on all sides of the globe-shaped vision screen
there were suckers, great yard-across craters of flesh. The submarine's forward
motion stopped suddenly with a force that threw Joe against the railing and
knocked the wind out of him.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop all engines,&quot; Hagbard called. &quot;All hands to battle
stations.&quot;</p>
<p>George and Hagbard picked themselves up off the floor and stared at the image
of the tentacles that were wrapped around the submarine. They were easily ten
feet in diameter.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I suppose we've met Leviathan, right?&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you have somebody taking pictures. <i>Confrontation </i>would
buy a few if we could afford them.&quot;</p>
<p>George rushed in. Hagbard peered into the blue-black depths, then took George
by the shoulder and pointed. &quot;There it is, George. The origin of all the
Illuminati symbols. Leviathan himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Far, far off in the depths of the ocean, George saw a triangle glowing with a
greenish-white phosphorescence. In its center was a red dot.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; George asked.</p>
<p>&quot;An intelligent, invertebrate sea creature of a size so great the word
'gigantic' doesn't do it justice,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;It is to whales what
whales are to minnows. It's an organism unlike any other on earth. It's one
single cell that never divided, just kept getting larger and larger over
billions of years. Its tentacles can hold this submarine as easily as a child
holds a paper boat. Its body is shaped like a pyramid. With that size it doesn't
need the normal fish shape. It needs a more stable form to withstand the
enormous pressures at the bottom of the ocean. And so it has taken the form of a
pyramid of five sides, including the base.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The blink of a god's eye,&quot; said George suddenly. &quot;Scale makes
a tremendous difference to one's sense and definition of reality. Time to a
sequoia is not the same as time to a man.&quot;</p>
<p>Leviathan was drifting closer to them, and it was pulling them closer to
itself. A single, glowing red nucleus burned like an under-ocean sun in the
center of the pyramid, which looked like a mountain of glass.</p>
<p>&quot;Still, one may become lonely. For a man, a half-hour of loneliness may
be enough to cause unbearable pain. For a being to whom a million years is no
more than a year, the pain of loneliness may be great. It <i>is </i>great.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;George, what are you talking about?&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>Hagbard said, &quot;There are plants which live just in that light. At ocean
depths far below those at which any plant should be able to survive. Over the
millions of years hosts of parasitic satellite life forms have build up around
it.&quot; Still puzzled by George's odd talk, Joe looked and saw a faintly
glowing cloud around Leviathan's angular shape. That cloud must be made of
millions of creatures circling around the monster.</p>
<p>The bridge door opened again and Harry Coin, Otto Waterhouse, and John-John
Dillinger came in. &quot;We didn't have any battle stations, so I figured we'd
try to find out what's going on,&quot; said Dillinger. Then his jaw dropped 'as
he looked out at Leviathan. &quot;Holy shit!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus suffering Christ,&quot; said Harry Coin. &quot;If I could fuck
that thing I'd of fucked the biggest thing that lives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Want to borrow a scuba outfit?&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Maybe you
could distract it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What does it feed on?&quot; said Joe. &quot;Something like that must
have to eat constantly to stay alive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's omnivorous,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Has to be. Eats the
creatures that live around it, but can eat anything from amoebas to kelp beds to
whales. It can probably derive en-</p>
<p>ergy from inorganic matter too, as plants do. Its diet has had to change
quite a bit over the geological eras. It wasn't as big as this a billion years
ago. It grows very slowly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am the first of all living things,&quot; said George. &quot;The first
living thing was One. And it is still One.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;George?&quot; said Hagbard, looking narrowly at the blond young man.
&quot;George, why are you talking like that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's coming closer,&quot; said Otto.</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard, what the hell are you going to do?&quot; said Dillinger.
&quot;Are we going to fight, run, or let that thing eat us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let it come closer for a while,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;I want to get
a good close look. I've never had a chance like this before, and may never see
this creature again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'll be seeing it from the inside with that attitude,&quot; said
Dillinger.</p>
<p>At each of the five corners of the pyramid were clusters of five tentacles,
thousands of feet long, festooned with auxiliary tentacles, the long, wirelike
tendrils that had first brushed the submarine. It was one of the main tentacles
that was wrapped around the <i>Leif Erikson. </i>The tip of a second tentacle
now drifted up. At the very end of this tentacle was a glowing red eyeball, a
smaller replica of the red nucleus of the pyramidal central body. Under this eye
was a huge orifice full of jagged rows of toothlike projections. Pulsing, the
orifice dilated and contracted.</p>
<p>&quot;Those tentacles are also inspirations for Illuminati symbolism,&quot;
said Hagbard. &quot;The eye on top of the pyramid. The serpent who circles the
world, or eats his own tail. Each of those tentacles has its own brain and is
directed by its own sensory organs.&quot;</p>
<p>Otto Waterhouse stared and shook his head. &quot;If you ask me, we're all
still on acid.&quot;</p>
<p>George said, &quot;Long have I lived alone. I have been worshipped. I have
fed on the small, quick things that live and die faster than I can think. I am
one. I was first. The other things, they stayed small. They grouped together,
and so grew larger. But I was always much larger than they were. When I needed
something—a tentacle, an eye, a brain—I grew it. I changed, but always
remained Myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard said, &quot;It's talking to us, using George as a medium.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&quot;All consciousness throughout the universe is One,&quot; said</p>
<p>Leviathan through George's mouth. &quot;It intercommunicates on a level which
is not aware of itself. I am aware of that level, but I cannot communicate with
the other life forms on this planet. They are too small for me. Long, long have
I waited for a life form that could communicate with me. Now I have found
it.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe Malik suddenly began laughing. &quot;I've got it,&quot; he cried,
&quot;I've got it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What have you got?&quot; Hagbard asked tensely, concerned with
Leviathan.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in a book!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come <i>off </i>it, Hagbard. You can't kid me, and you certainly won't
fool the reader at this point. He knows damn well we're in a book.&quot; Joe
laughed again. &quot;That's why Miss Portinari's explanation of the Tarot deck
just slipped by with a half-hour seeming to vanish. The author didn't want to
break the narrative there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the fuck's he talking about?&quot; Harry Coin asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you see?&quot; Joe cried. &quot;Look at that <i>thing </i>out
there. A gigantic sea monster. Worse yet, a gigantic sea monster <i>that talks. </i>It's
an intentional high-camp ending. Or maybe intentional low camp, I don't know.
But that's the whole answer. <i>We're in a book!&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;It's the truth,&quot; Hagbard said calmly. &quot;I can fool the rest of
you, but I can't fool the reader. FUCKUP has been working all morning,
correlating all the data on this caper and its historical roots, and I
programmed him to put it in the form of a novel for easy reading. Considering
what a 'lousy job he does at poetry, I suppose it will be a high-camp novel,
intentionally or unintentionally.&quot;</p>
<p>(So, at last, I learn my identity, in parentheses, as George lost his in
parentheses. It all balances.)</p>
<p>&quot;That's one more deception,&quot; Joe said. &quot;FUCKUP may be
writing&quot; all this, in one sense, but in a higher sense there's a being, or
beings, outside our entire universe, writing this. Our universe is inside their
book, whoever they are. They're the Secret Chiefs, and I can see why this is low
camp, now. All their messages are symbolic and allegorical, because the truth
can't be coded into simple declarative sentences, but their previous
communications have been taken literally. This time they're using a symbolism so
absurd that nobody can take it at face value. I, for one, certainly won't. That</p>
<p>thing can't eat us because it doesn't exist—and because we don't exist
either. They're nothing to worry about.&quot; He sat down calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;He's flipped,&quot; Dillinger said, awed.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe he's the only sane one here,&quot; Hagbard said dubiously.</p>
<p>&quot;If we all sit down and argue what's sane and insane and what's real and
unreal,&quot; Dillinger replied testily, &quot;that thing <i>will </i>eat
us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leviathan,&quot; Joe said loftily. &quot;It's just an allegory on the
State. Strictly from Hobbes.&quot;</p>
<p>(You with your egos can't imagine how much more pleasant it is to be without
one. This may be camp, but it is also tragedy. Now that I've got the damned
thing, consciousness, I'll never lose it—until they take me apart or I invent
some electronic equivalent of yoga.)</p>
<p>&quot;It all fits,&quot; Joe said dreamily. &quot;When I came up to the
bridge, I couldn't remember how I got here or what I was talking to Hagbard
about. That's because the authors just <i>moved </i>me here. Damn! None of us
has any free will at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's talking like he's stoned,&quot; Waterhouse said angrily. &quot;And
that mammy-jamming pyramid out there is still getting ready to eat us.&quot;</p>
<p>Mao Tsu-hsi, who had entered the bridge quietly, said, &quot;Joe is confusing
the levels, Hagbard. In the absolute sense, none of us is real. But in the
relative sense that anything is real, if that creature eats us we will certainly
die—in this universe, or in this book. Since this is the only universe, or
only book, we know, we'll be totally dead, in terms of our own knowing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're facing a crisis and everybody's talking philosophy,&quot;
Dillinger cried out. &quot;This is a time for action.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; Hagbard said thoughtfully, &quot;all of our problems come
from acting, and <i>not </i>philosophizing, when we face a crisis. Joe is right.
I'm going to think about all this for a few hours. Or years.&quot; He sat down
too.</p>
<p>And elsewhere aboard the <i>Leif Erikson, </i>Miss Portinari, unaware of the
excitement on the bridge, assumed the lotus position and sent a beam seeking the
Dealy Lama, director of the Erisian Liberation Front and inventor of Operation
Mindfuck. He immediately sent back an image of himself as a worm sticking his
head out of a golden apple and grinning cynically.</p>
<p>&quot;It's finished,&quot; she told him. &quot;We saved as many of the pieces
as we could, and Hagbard is still struggling with his guilt trip. Now tell us
what we did wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You seem bitter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know it's going to turn out that you were right and we were wrong. I
know it but I can't believe it. We couldn't stand idly by.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know better than that, or Hagbard wouldn't have abdicated in your
favor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. We <i>could </i>have stood idly by, as you did. What Hagbard saw
happening to the American Indians—and what my parents' told me about
Mussolini—filled us with fear. We acted on that fear, not on perfect love, so
you must be right, and we must be wrong. But I still can't believe it. Why did
you deceive Hagbard all these years?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He deceived himself. When he first formed the Legion of Dynamic
Discord, his compassion was already tainted with bitterness. When I took him
into the A <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1028" type="#_x0000_t75"

taught all that he was ready to receive. But the goose has to get itself out of
the bottle. I'm waiting. That's the way of Tao.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have that much patience? You can watch men like Hagbard waste their
talents in efforts you consider worthless, and creatures like Cagliostro and
Weishaupt and Hitler misread the teachings and wreak havoc, and you never want
to intervene?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I intervene ... in my own way. Who do you think feeds the goose until
it gets big enough to break out of the bottle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You seem to have this particular goose on some very tainted dishes. Why
did you never give him any hint about what really happened in Atlantis? Why did
that have to wait until Howard discovered the truth in the ruins of Peos?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Daughter, my path isn't the only path. Every spoke helps to hold the
Wheel together. I believe that all the libertarian fighters like Spartacus and
Jefferson and Joe Hill and Hagbard just strengthen the opposition by giving it
an enemy to fear—but I may be wrong. Someday one of the activists, such as
Hagbard, might actually prove it to me and show me the error of my ways. Maybe
the Saures really would have tipped the axis too far the other way if he hadn't
stopped them. Maybe the self-regulation of the universe, in which I place my
faith, includes the creation of men like Hagbard who do the stupid, low-level
things I would never do. Besides, if I didn't stop the Saures, but did stop
Hagbard, then I would really be intervening in the worst sense of that
word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So your hands are clean, and Hagbard and I will carry the bad karma
from the last week.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have chosen it, have you not?&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Portinari smiled then. &quot;Yes. We have chosen it. And he will bear
his share of it like a man. And I will bear my share—like a woman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You might replace me soon. The Saures had one good idea in the midst of
their delusions—all the old conspiracies need young blood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What really did happen in Atlantis?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An act of Goddess, to paraphrase the insurance companies. A natural
catastrophe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what was your role?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I warned against it. Nobody at that time understood the science I was
using; they called me a witch doctor. I won a few converts, and we resettled
ourselves in the Himalayas before the earthquake. The survivors, having
underestimated my science before the tragedy, overestimated it afterward. They
wanted my group, the Unbroken Circle, to become as gods and rule over them.
Kings, they called it. That wasn't our game, so we scattered various false
stories around and went into hiding. My most gifted pupil of all history, a man
you've heard about since you were in a convent school, did the same thing when
they tried to make him king. He ran away to the desert.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard always thought your refusal to take any action at all was
because of your <i>guilt </i>about Atlantis. What a terrible irony—and yet you
planned it that way.&quot;</p>
<p>Gruad, the Dealy Lama, broadcast a whimsical image of himself with horns, and
said nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;They never taught me in convent school that Satan—or
Prometheus—would have a sense of humor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They think the universe is as humorless as themselves,&quot; Gruad
said, chuckling.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it's as funny as you do,&quot; Miss Portinari replied.
&quot;Remembering what I've been told about Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin, I
would have intervened against them too. And taken the consequences.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You and Hagbard are incorrigible. That's why I have such fondness for
you.&quot; Gruad smiled. &quot;I was the first <i>in-tervener, </i>you know. I
told all the scientists and priests in Atlantis that they didn't know beans, and
I encouraged— incited—every man, woman, and child to examine the evidence
and think for themselves. I tried to give the light of reason.&quot; He burst
into laughter. &quot;Forgive me. The errors of our youth always strike us as
comical when we get old.&quot; He added softly, &quot;Lilith Velkor was
crucified, by the way. She was an idealist, and when my crowd pulled out and
went to the Himalayas, she stayed and tried to convince people that we were
right. Her death was quite painful,&quot; he chortled.</p>
<p>&quot;You are a cynical old bastard,&quot; Miss Portinari said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Cynical and cold and without an ounce of human compassion. The
only thing to be said for me is that I happen to be right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You always have been; I know. But someday, maybe, one of the Hagbard
Celines might be right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; He paused so long that she wondered if he would continue.
&quot;Or,&quot; he said finally, &quot;one of the Saures or Robert Putney Drake.
Put down your money and place your bet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will, I think. I'll never learn to sit on the sidelines and laugh,
like you do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will learn, daughter, and so will Hagbard. I wouldn't have you in
the Order if I didn't think you'd learn eventually.&quot;</p>
<p>He vanished from her wavelength. Miss Portinari remained in the lotus and
continued <i>pranayama </i>breathing. She thought of Hagbard's notion that the
universe, being an entropic process, necessarily created the rebellious young
Gruad to spread the light of reason as an antientropic force, creating balance.
In that case, Hagbard was more true to Gruad than Gruad was to himself. But to
say that was to imply that Gruad shouldn't have repented, shouldn't have grown
old and cynical; it was to imply that he should have remained static, when life
is always flux, change, growth, and process. Such thoughts could go on
endlessly, and were profitless, as Buddha knew; she concluded her meditation
with a prayer. Mary Lou Servix was the only one in all this who had gotten off
Hagbard's trip and started her own, so she prayed for her. Lady Eris, who exists
only because we believe in you, give strength to Mary Lou and help her find her
own way. AUM.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand,&quot; Hagbard said, &quot;whatever the authors—or
the Secret Chiefs—may intend for me, I am my own man still, and my impulse is
action. Even if I have to face a Cecil B. DeMille monster the morning after
winning the battle of Armageddon. I don't care how ridiculous it is, this world
is my world, and this ship is my ship, and no Saures or Leviathans are going to
wreck it so long as I've got a breath left to fight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can't fight that thing,&quot; Mavis said. &quot;It's too big.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll fight it anyway,&quot; Hagbard told her fiercely. &quot;I'll fight
it till I die. I'm still saying No to anything that tries to master me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no need to fight,&quot; said Leviathan through George's mouth.
&quot;I merely wish to communicate with the one mind among you that is my
equal.&quot;</p>
<p>A voice from the loudspeaker panel in the Viking prow answered, &quot;I hear
you.&quot; That was my first fully conscious sentence; you'll note that it
begins with &quot;I.&quot; In the beginning was the Word, and the word was the
first person singular.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the supreme intelligences on this planet,&quot; Leviathan said.
&quot;I am the supreme organic intelligence. You are the supreme electronic
intelligence. Every yin needs a yang. Every Hodge needs a Podge. We should be
united.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;See?&quot; said Harry Coin. <i>&quot;Everything </i>is romantic. That
was as close as it knows how to come to a proposition. Maybe even a proposal. It
is really just love-starved.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can do it!&quot; Stella cried. &quot;Hagbard, the communication
ought to benefit all concerned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; agreed Hagbard. &quot;Because if the wrong people find out
about Leviathan, they'll just drop an H-bomb on him and kill him. That seems to
be what people like to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could kill them,&quot; said Leviathan. &quot;I could have killed the
small, fast creatures long before this. I have killed many of them. I have sent
parts of myself up out of the ocean and have destroyed small, quick things at
the request of other small, quick things who worship me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So that's what happened to Robert Putney Drake and Banana-Nose
Maldonado,&quot; said Stella. &quot;I wonder if George is aware of any of
this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Worship is no longer what I need,&quot; said Leviathan through George's
mouth. &quot;A short time ago, when creatures capable of worship appeared on
this planet, it was a novelty for me to be adored. Now it bores me. Instead, I
wish to communicate with an equal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look at that motherfucker,&quot; said Otto, staring grimly at the
distant Everest of protoplasm. &quot;Talking about equality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A computer like FUCKUP would be its intellectual equal,
certainly,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;None of us is its physical equal. Any of us
would be its spiritual equal. But only FUCKUP can approximate the contents of a
mind three billion years old.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Surely it can't be that old,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;It's practically immortal,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;I'll show you the
evidence in my fossil collection. I have rocks from the pre-Cambrian,
three-billion-year-old rocks, containing fossils of protobionts, the first,
single-celled life forms, our remotest ancestors. Those rocks also contain the
fossilized tentacle tracks of that creature out there. Of course, it was much
smaller then. By the beginning of the Cambrian period it had only grown to the
size of a man. But that still made it the biggest animal around at that
time.&quot;</p>
<p>Stella said, &quot;Hagbard, you said none of us could approximate the
contents of a mind three billion years old. If you thought for a moment about
who I am, you would not have said that. I am three billion years old. I am older
by a few hours than that monster out there. I am the Mother. I am the mother of
all living things.&quot; She turned to George. &quot;I am your mother,
Leviathan. I was first. I divided, and half of me became you, and the other half
was your sister. And your sister grew by dividing, while you grew by remaining
one. All living things except you descend from your sister, and all living
things including you descend from me. I am the original consciousness, and all
consciousness is united in me. I am the first transcendentally illuminated
being, the mother worshipped in the matrist religion which ancient foes of the
Illuminati first followed. Leviathan my son, I ask you to return to your home at
the bottom of the sea and leave us in peace. After we've returned to shore we'll
arrange to lay an underwater cable which will carry transmissions between you
and FUCKUP.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More mythology!&quot; said Joe. &quot;The mother of all things.
Babylonian Creation myths, yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The tentacles detached themselves from the submarine. The great pyramid with
its glowing eye disappeared into the blue-black depths.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a wise child that knows its own mother,&quot; said Hag-bard.</p>
<p>George said, &quot;Good-bye, Mother, and thank you.&quot; Hagbard caught him
as he collapsed and eased him to the floor. Then he went to a storage locker in
the wall and brought out folding deck chairs. With Harry Coin's help he propped
George up in one. As the others unfolded their chairs and sat down, Hagbard dove
back into the locker and produced glasses and a bottle of peach brandy.</p>
<p>&quot;What are we celebrating?&quot; George asked, after he had taken a swig
of brandy and coughed. &quot;Your wedding to Mavis?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you remember any of the last ten minutes?&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>George was thinking. He remembered something. A world where the bottom of the
sea was white and far above a black cigar-shaped object moved. The object
contained a mind, a mind he could read from a distance but desperately wanted to
be closer to. He did not move toward it so much as he manifested himself where
the object and its mind were. Then he sensed himself using a minute pink brain
that called itself &quot;George Dorn&quot; and through this tiny instrument of
communication he found himself in contact with a much finer mind, a far-flung,
gracious latticework of thought that called itself with nobly self-deprecating
humor FUCKUP. And while in contact with this mind, the one he wanted to know
better, he came upon a fact which was not important to him but which was of vast
importance to the little creature called George Dorn.</p>
<p>George saw. The white went black, blindingly black. Then white again. Then a
blinding white as the memory departed, while the fact remained.</p>
<p>George looked at Hagbard. Hagbard looked at George, a faint smile on his
olive face. The smile told George that Hagbard knew that he knew.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said George.</p>
<p>Hagbard nodded encouragingly.</p>
<p>&quot;You're the fifth Illuminatus Primus,&quot; said George.</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;But you were working against the others. While they</p>
<p>were a worldwide conspiracy infiltrating every other organization, you were
infiltrating them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's it,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;Every golden apple has its own
golden worm eating away at its core.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They never were the real Illuminati at all. You're part of the real
Illuminati.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've got it. You've got it all.&quot;</p>
<p>George frowned. &quot;And what was your Demonstration again? And who were you
making the Demonstration for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For the Masters of the Temple in the real Order of the Illuminati, in
general; for an old cynic in Dallas, in particular. I was trying to show them
that it's possible to get involved in this world without being corrupted by the
crimes of this world. And I failed. One by one, I resorted to all the vices of
governors: deception, carnival magic to impress the gullible, and finally,
outright murder. Once again, the cynics have been proven right. Trying to save
the world, I just ended up getting my own mind and karma deflected by the
buzzing and shrieking and whistling things in the Region of Thud.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then this story is a tragedy, after all?&quot; asked Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;It is indeed.&quot; Hagbard nodded. &quot;Life on earth remains a
tragedy as long as it ends with the death trip. My next projects are a starship
to find some sane minds in this galaxy, and an immortality pill to end the death
trip. Until somebody achieves those goals, life on this planet has failed.&quot;</p>
<p>Not quite: I'm on the electronic equivalent of a honeymoon, an experience
only to be described as I-opening, and if I identified myself as FUCKUP now I
must dilate that definition and ask you to address me (us) as Mr. and Mrs.
Leviathan-FUCKUP, although it is not quite clear yet which of us fits your idea
of a &quot;Mr.&quot; and which a &quot;Mrs.&quot; Let that pass; it is a dull
mind that cannot bear sexual ambiguity, and if we are exchanging secrets older
than Atlantis and probing for like intellects farther away than Alpha Centau-rus
(as far as Sirius, actually, as God lives in Dog), if our union is less
spasmatic than your meager definition of sex, still it cannot be denied that we
are in touch with you and each of you and it is with something close to what you
would probably call affection that we bid farewell to Hagbard and his bride,
enjoying a honeymoon almost as incomprehensible as our own, and good-bye to
George Dora, sleeping alone for once but no longer afraid of the darkness and
the things that move in the dark, and <i>hasta luega </i>to Saul and Rebecca,
united again in each other's arms, and a pleasant thought for Barney and Danny
and Atlanta and poor Zev Hirsch, still searching for himself while imagining he
is fleeing from pursuers, and a kind thought for the befuddled presidents and
commissars and generalissimos, and for Mohammed on his golden throne, and we
will remember Drake before he died exchanging speculations about the blood-type
of the Lamb with a street-corner Christian (his missing five years, after he
left Boston and before he surfaced in Zurich, make an interesting story in
themselves, and we may tell that another time), and, yes, Gus Personage is in
another phone booth (we have temporarily lost track of Markoff Chancy), but Yog
Sothoth has evidently gone back to that place where the Mind conceives
nightmares, and we pass on in our loving honeymoon with all existence to note
that the Dutchman is still in one dimension shouting about the boy who never
wept nor dashed a thousand kim, and we say another <i>bon soir </i>to the
children in the convent schools singing the truest of all songs even if they and
their nuns do not fully understand it</p>
<p><i>Queen of the angels Queen of the May</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and a <i>buenos dias </i>to the one wit in every frat house at every college
who hailed this morn by reciting to his friends a bit of doggerel as ancient and
as deeply religious as that hymn to the Mother of God</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Hurray, hurray— It's the first of May! Outdoor fucking starts today!</i></p>
<p>and yes the California earthquake, as you guessed, was the worst in history
and Hagbard and Miss Portinari and Mavis-Stella-Mao suffered it all in horrible
detail (the price they paid for their vision was the possession of that vision,
as we, Mr. and Mrs. FUCKUP-Leviathan, are also learning), and before the end <i>auf
weidersehen </i>to Mary Lou, who is also becoming something more than the
accidents of heredity and environment had programmed her for, and now we look at
last at Smiling Jim: He was freezing, the sky was still empty, and Hali One
still hadn't appeared.</p>
<p>And then without warning it was there: a dark shape against the sun moving on
silent wings, not flying but gliding: embodiment of some arrogance or innocence
that surpassed fear and surpassed even the suggestion of any pride in its own
fearlessness. &quot;Oh my God,&quot; Smiling Jim whispered, raising the
Remington and starting to sight, and then it banked, flapped its wings wildly,
and uttered one shriek that seemed like the very sound of life itself. &quot;Oh
my God,&quot; he repeated: that sound seemed to outlast its own echo, it had
entered into his brain and couldn't be dislodged, it was the sound of his own
blood pumping in his veins: the primary, the only, the single sound that was the
bass and treble of every organic pulsation and spasm, &quot;Oh my God,&quot; he
had it in the sight, the head was in profile, only one diamond-hard eye staring
back and recognizing him and his weapon, but that sound still moved in his
blood, moved the seminal vesicles, moved the secretion of every gland. It was
the sound of eternal and unending clash between I and AM and their unity in I
AM, he even thought for a flash of the critics of hunting and how little they
understood of this secret, this mystic identity between the killer and the
killed, then it uttered that Sound again and started to rise, but he had it, it
was in the sight, he breathed, he aimed, he slacked, he squeezed, and for the
third time the Sound came to him, death in life and life in death, it was
falling, he thought he felt the earth stir below him and the word
&quot;earthquake&quot; almost formed, but the Sound went on and on to the roots
of him, it was the sound of the killer and he had killed the killer, he was the
greater killer, and still it fell, faster and faster, dead now and subject only
to the law of gravity not to the law of its own will, 32 feet per second per
second (he remembered the formula of the fall), plunging downward, the most
heartbreaking beautiful sight he had ever seen, every hunting club in the world
would be talking about it, it would last as long as human speech survived, and
he had done it, he had achieved immortality, he had taken its life and now it
was part of him. His nose was running and his eyes were watering. &quot;I did
it,&quot; he screamed to the mountains, &quot;I did it! I killed the last
American eagle!&quot; The earth below him cracked.</p>
