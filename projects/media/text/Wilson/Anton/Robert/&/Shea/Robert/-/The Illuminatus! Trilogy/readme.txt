special thanks to the creator/s of v1.0 from which this version is based. v1.5 is basically a splitting of the older single-file version into several more manageable chunks (for those of us with not as much RAM, or patience, or both). cover.htm may be taken to be the index, while contents.htm is the primary point from which to reach the text. unsplit.htm is essentially v1.0 with the contents added as intra-page links. this book is a holy text of discordianism, and it has been fun to profane it by treating it as nothing more than raw data to shove around, which it also is. hail Eris, enjoy reading, and hold onto your sanity caps. or don't. whatever.

(this conversion was undertaken in the sixth year preceding the sixth age, which i am sure contains some cosmic significance. which does? whichever. don't let me keep you from reading that which you came for.)
