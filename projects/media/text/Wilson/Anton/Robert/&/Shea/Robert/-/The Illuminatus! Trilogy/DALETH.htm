<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">HASSAN i SABBAH AND ALAMOUT BLACK</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Prophet died in 4632 A.M.,* the true faith was almost immediately
shattered by conflict between the Shiite and Sunnite parties. More than a
century of religious and civil warfare followed, and by 4760 A.M. the Shiites
themselves had split and given birth to a subsect known as the Ismailis, or
Ishmaelians. It was out of this group that Has-, san i Sabbah formed the Order
of the Assassins in 5090 A.M.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* Known as the year 52 to Moslems, 4392 to
Jews and Scotch Rite Masons, 4320 to Confucians, and 632 to Christians.</span></p>
<p>Ishmaelian religion had already at that date become a nine-level affair in
the manner typical of mystical secret societies. Those of the lowest grade, for
instance, were merely informed that <i>Al Koran </i>contained an allegorical
meaning in addition to its surface teachings, and that their salvation lay in
following orders. As a neophyte progressed through the various grades, more and
more of the allegories would be explained, and a doctrine would gradually emerge
which is, in essence, that taught by all the mystics of East and
West—Buddhists, Taoists, Vedantists, Rosicrucians, etc. The doctrine is, in
important aspects, unspeakable (which is why the trainee required an <i>imam—</i>the
Ishmaelian equivalent of a <i>guru—</i>to guide him in the nonverbal aspects)
; the ninth and highest grade, however, had no parallel except in very strict
Theravada Buddhism. In this ninth grade, which Hassan attained shortly before
founding the Hashishim, it was taught that even the personal mystical experience
of the seeker (his own encounter with the Absolute, or the Void, or the
Hodge-Podge, or God, or Goddess, or whatever one chooses to call it) should be
subject to the most merciless analysis and criticism, and that there is no guide
superior to reason. The Ishmaelian adept, in short, was one who had achieved
supreme mystical awareness but refused to make even that into an idol; he was a
total atheist-anarchist subject to no authority but his own independent mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Such men are dangerous,&quot; as Caesar observed, and certainly they
are dangerous to the Caesars; the Ishmaelians were being persecuted throughout
the Moslem world, and strong efforts were being made to exterminate them
entirely when Hassan i Sabbah became Imam of the whole movement.</p>
<p>It was Hassan's cynical judgment (and many Illuminated beings, such as the
Lamas of Tibet, have agreed with him) that most people have no aspiration or
capacity for much spiritual and intellectual independence. He thereupon
reorganized the Ishmaelians in such a way as to allow and encourage those of
small mind to remain in the lower grades.</p>
<p>The tools of this enterprise were the famous &quot;Garden of Delights&quot;
in his castle at Alamout (a good duplication of the Paradise of <i>Al Koran, </i>complete
with the beautiful and willing houris the Prophet had promised to the
faithful)— and a certain &quot;magick chemical.&quot; Those of the lowest
grade were brought to Alamout, given the miraculous concoction, and set loose
for several hours in the Garden of Delights. They came out convinced that they
had truly visited heaven and that Hassan i Sabbah was the most powerful Holy Man
in the world. They were assured, furthermore, that if they obeyed every order,
even at the cost of their own lives, they would return to that Paradise after
death.</p>
<p>These men became the first &quot;sleeper agents&quot; in the history of
international politics. Where the three major contending religions of that time
in the Near East (Christianity, Judaism, and orthodox Islam) insisted that it
was an unforgivable sin to deny one's faith, Hassan taught that Allah would
forgive such little white lies when they served a worthy purpose. Thus, his
agents were able to pass themselves off as Christians, Jews, or orthodox Moslems
and infiltrate any court, holy order, or army at will. Since the other religions
had the above-mentioned prohibition against such deception, they were unable to
infiltrate the Ishmaelians in turn.</p>
<p>The use of these agents as assassins is discussed <i>passim </i>in the novel,
and Weishaupt's opinion that Hassan had discovered &quot;the moral equivalent of
war&quot; is an interesting commentary. Hassan never had to send an army into
battle, and armies sent against him were soon stopped by the sudden and
unexpected deaths of their generals.</p>
<p>One of Hassan's successors was Sinan, who moved the headquarters of the cult
from Alamout to Messiac and may (or may not) have written the letter about
Richard the Lion-Hearted which George recalls in the Third Trip. Sinan,
contemporaries claimed, performed miracles of healing, conversed with invisible
beings, and was never seen to eat, drink, or perform the functions of urination
and excretion. He was also credited with telepathy and with the ability to kill
animals by looking at them. It was he (and not Hassan i Sabbah, as many popular
books state) who ordered two of the lower members of the Order to commit suicide
in order to impress a visiting ambassador with his power over his followers.
(The two obeyed, leaping from the castle wall into the abyss below.) Sinan also
made attempts to form ah alliance with the Knights Templar, to drive both
orthodox Christians and orthodox Moslems out of the arena, but this evidently
fell through.</p>
<p>The Hashishim were finally crushed, despite their powerful espionage and
assassination network, when the whole Middle East was overrun by hordes of
Mongols, who came from so far away that they had not been infiltrated. It took
several centuries for the Hashishim to make a comeback as the nonviolent
Ishmaelian movement of today, under the leadership of the Aga Khan.</p>
<p>Finally, it was at Hassan i Sabbah's death that he allegedly uttered the
aphorism for which he is best known, and which is quoted several times in the
novel: &quot;Nothing is true. All is permissible.&quot; The orthodox Moslem
historian Juvaini—who may have invented this whole episode—adds that as soon
as these blasphemous words passed his lips, &quot;Hassan's soul plunged to the
depths of Hell.&quot;</p>
<p>Ever since Marco Polo recorded the story of the Garden of Delights, Western
commentators have identified Hassan's &quot;magick chemical&quot; as pure
hashish. Recent scholarship, however, has thrown this into doubt, and it is
clear that hashish, and other marijuana preparations were well known in the Near
East for thousands of years before Hassan ever lived; for instance, the plant
has been found in grave mounds of late Neolithic Man in the area, dated around
5000 B.C., as Hagbard mentions in the novel. It is implausible, then, that the
ingenious Sabbah would have tried to pass this drug off as something new and
magical.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that Hassan, who was known to have traveled much in his
youth, might have brought opium back from the East and mixed it with hashish.
The scholarly Dr. Joel Fort goes further and argues, in <i>The Pleasure Seekers,
</i>that Hassan's supercharger was wine-and-opium, with no marijuana products at
all. Dr. John Allegro, in <i>The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross, </i>argues that
both Hassan and the first Christians actually achieved the paradisical vision
with the aid of <i>amanita muscaria, </i>the &quot;fly agaric&quot; mushroom,
which is poisonous in high doses but psychedelic (or at least deleriant) in
small quantities.</p>
<p>The present book's suggestion—Alamout black, an almost pure hashish with a
few pinches of belladonna and stramonium—is based on:</p>
<p>(1) the strong etymological evidence that the Hashishim Were <i>somehow </i>involved
with hashish;</p>
<p>(2) the unlikelihood that wine, opium, mushrooms, or any combination thereof
could account for the etymological and historical association of Hassan with
hashish;</p>
<p>(3) the reasons previously given for doubting that hashish <i>alone </i>is
the answer;</p>
<p>(4) the capacity of stramonium and belladonna (in small doses) to create
intensely brilliant visual imagery, beyond that of even the best grades of
hashish;</p>
<p>(5) the fact that these latter drugs were used in both the Elusinian
Mysteries and in the European witch cult contemporary with Hassan (see R.E.L.
Masters, <i>Eros and Evil).</i></p>
<p>Since it is not the intent of this book to confuse fact with fancy, it should
be pointed out that these arguments are strong but not compelling. Many other
alternatives can be suggested, such as hashish-belladonna-mandragora,
hash-ish-stramonium-opium, hashish-opium-belladonna, hashish-opium-bufotinin,*
etc., etc. All that can be said with certainty is that Hagbard Celine insists
the correct formula is hashish-belladonna-stramonium (in ratio 20:1:1), and we
believe Hagbard—most of the time.</p>
<p>The exact link between the Assassins and the European Illuminati remains
unclear. We have seen (but no longer own) a John Birch Society publication
arguing that the alliance between the Hashishim and the Knights Templar was
consummated and that European masonry has been more or less under Hashishim
influence ever since. More likely is the theory of Daraul <i>(op. cit.) </i>that
after the Hashishim regrouped as the nonviolent Ishmaelian sect of today, the
Roshinaya (Illuminated Ones) copied their old tactics and were in turn copied by
the Allumbrados of Spain and, finally, by the Bavarian Illuminati.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* Medieval magicians knew how to obtain
bufotinin. They took it, as Shakespeare recorded, from &quot;skin of toad.&quot;</span></p>
<p>The nine stages of Hashishim training, the thirteen stages in Weishaupt's
Iluminati, the thirty-two degrees of masonry, etc., are, of course, arbitrary.
The Theravada Buddhists have a system of forty meditations, each leading to a
definite stage of growth. Some schools of Hinduism recognize only two stages: <i>Dhyana,
</i>conquest of the personal ego, and <i>Samadhi, </i>unity with the Whole. One
can equally well posit five stages or a hundred and five. The essential that is
common to all these systems is that the trainee, at some point or other, is
nearly scared to death.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* An interesting account of a traditional
system used by quite primitive Mexican Indians, yet basically similar to any and
all of the above, is provided by anthropologist Carlos Castaneda, who underwent
training with a Yaqui shaman, and recounts some of the terrors vividly in <i>The
Teachings of Don Juan, A Separate Reality, Journey to Ixtlan, </i>and <i>Tales
of Power. </i>Don Juan used peyote, stramonium, and a magic mushroom (probably <i>psilocyble
Mexicana, </i>the drug Tim Leary used for his first trip).</span></p>
<p>The difference between these systems is that some aim to liberate every
candidate and some, like Sabbah's and Weishaupt's, deliberately encourage the
majority to remain in ignorance, whereby they may with profit be endlessly
exploited by their superiors in the cult. The same general game of an
illuminated minority misusing a superstitious majority was characteristic of
Tibet until the Chinese Communist invasion broke the power of the high lamas. A
sympathetic account of the Tibetan system, which goes far toward justifying it,
can be found in Alexandra David-Neel's <i>The Hidden Teachings of Tibetan
Buddhism; </i>an unsympathetic account by a skeptical fellow mystic is available
in <i>The Confessions of Aleister Crowley.</i></p>
<p>Another word about Alamout black: It is not for the inexperienced psychedelic
voyager. For instance, the first time Simon Moon tried it, in early 1968, he had
occasion to use the men's room in the Biograph Theatre (where he had gone to see
<i>Yellow Submarine </i>while under the influence). After his bowel movement he
reached for the toilet paper and saw with consternation that the first sheet
hanging down off the roll was neatly stamped</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OFFICIAL</p>
<p>BAVARIAN ILLUMINATI EWIGE BLUMENKRAFT!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On ordinary marijuana or hashish, such illusions occur, of course—but they
are not true hallucinations. They go away if you look 'at them hard enough. No
matter how hard Simon looked at the toilet paper, it still said</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OFFICIAL</p>
<p>BAVARIAN ILLUMINATI EWIGE BLUMENKRAFT!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simon went back to his seat in the theater badly shaken. For weeks afterward
he wondered if the Illuminati had some sinister reason for infiltrating the
toilet-paper industry, or if the whole experience were a genuine hallucination
and the first sign, as he put it, &quot;that this fucking dope is ruining my
fucking head.&quot; He never solved this mystery, but eventually he stopped
worrying about it</p>
<p>As for Hassan i Sabbah X and the Cult of the Black</p>
<p>Mother, the authors have been able to learn precious little about them. Since
they are clearly related <i>somehow </i>to the Assassins and the cult of Kali,
Mother of Destruction, one can consider them part of the Illuminati, or Podge,
side of the Sacred Chao; since they seem to be businessmen rather than fanatics,
and since Kali might be a version of Eris, one can consider them part of the
Discordian or Hodge side. Amid such speculation and much mystery, they go their
dark way, peddling horse and preaching some pretty funky doctrines about Whitey.
Perhaps they intend to betray everybody and run off with the loot at an
opportune moment—and, then again, maybe they are the only really dedicated
revolutionaries around. &quot;Nothing is too heavy to be knocked on its ass, and
everything is cool, baby&quot; is the only summary of his personal philosophy
that Hassan i Sabbah X himself would give us. He's a studly dude, and we didn't
press him.</p>
