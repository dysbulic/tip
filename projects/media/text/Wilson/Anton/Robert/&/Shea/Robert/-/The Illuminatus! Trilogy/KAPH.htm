<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saul, Barney, Markoff Chancy, and Dillinger were all puzzled that a man like
Carmel would bring a suitcase full of roses with him when fleeing to Lehman
Cavern. Those who knew Carmel in Las Vegas were even more perplexed when this
fact was made public. The first readers of this romance were not only puzzled
and perplexed but petulant, since they knew Carmel had loaded his briefcase with
Mal-donado's money, not with roses.</p>
<p>The explanation, as is usually the case when seeming magick has occurred, was
simple: Carmel was the victim of the oldest swindle in the world, the <i>okkana
borra </i>(gypsy switch). It was his custom to transport his earnings to the
bank in the same suitcase which he used when looting Maldonado's safe. His
figure, and the suitcase, were well known to the shadier elements in Las Vegas,
and among these were three gentlemen who decided early in April to intercept him
during one of his journeys and remove the suitcase from his possession, using,
as young people say, &quot;any means necessary&quot;; they even considered
striking him upon the temple with a blunt instrument. One of the gentlemen
involved in this project, John Wayne Malatesta, however, had a sense of humor
(of sorts) and began to devise a plan involving a nonviolent gypsy switch. Mr.
Malatesta thought it would be amusing if this could be carried off smoothly and
Carmel, arriving at the bank, opened a case full of horse manure, human
excrement, or something else in equally dubious taste. The other two gentlemen
were persuaded that this might indeed be worth a laugh. A substitute suitcase
was purchased, and a plan was devised.</p>
<p>Two changes were made at virtually the last minute. Mr. Malatesta learned
from Bonnie Quint (a lady whose company he often enjoyed, at $100 a throw) that
Carmel suffered acutely from rose fever. A more hilarious image occurred to him:
Carmel opening the case in the bank and starting to sneeze spasmodically while
trying to figure out where the switch had been made. The roses were purchased,
and the caper was set for the next day.</p>
<p>When Carmel, Dr. Naismith, and Markoff Chaney collided, Malatesta and his
associates abandoned the switch idea: Two collisions in a few minutes would be
more than a man like Carmel would accept without profound suspicion. They
therefore decided to follow him to his house and revert to the more
old-fashioned but time-proven technique of the sudden rap on the skull.</p>
<p>When Bonnie Quint left after her violent interview with Carmel, the bandits
prepared to enter. To their amazement, Carmel came running out, threw his
suitcase into his jeep, and then ran back in. (He had forgotten his candies.)</p>
<p>&quot;It's God's will,&quot; Malatesta said piously.</p>
<p>The switch was made, and they took off for points south in a great hurry.</p>
<p>Several weeks after the crisis had passed, a state trooper found a car with
three dead men in it off the road in a ditch. His own symptoms were
self-diagnosed while he waited for the coroner's crew to arrive, and he received
the antidote in time.</p>
<p>The empty suitcase in the car caused only minor speculation: A Gila monster
had obviously eaten most of one side</p>
<p>of it to shreds. &quot;Whatever they had in there,&quot; the trooper said
later, &quot;must have been pretty light. The wind blew it all over the freaking
desert.&quot;</p>
