<p>The mutation from terrestrial to interstellar life must be made, because the

Earth is a stepping stone on our time-trip through the galaxy. Life has to get
its seed-self off the planet to survive . . .</p>

<p>SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk. PURPOSE: To sink object
or an object or a thing ... in water or mud or anything you can sink something
in. RULES: Sinking is allowed in any manner. To date, ten-pound chunks of mud
have been used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water or
a hole to drop things into. But rivers—bays—gulfs—I dare say even
oceans—can be used.</p>
<p>TURNS are taken thusly: whosoever gets the junk up and in the air first.</p>
<p>DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing SINK to help find more
objects to sink, once one object is sunk. UPON SINKING: The sinker shall yell,
&quot;I sank it!&quot; or something equally as thoughtful.</p>
<p>NAMING OF OBJECTS is sometimes desirable. The object is named by the finder
of such object, and whoever sinks it can say (for instance), &quot;I sank
Columbus, Ohio.&quot;</p>

<p>For over a week the musicians had been boarding planes and heading for
Ingolstadt. As early as April 23, while Simon and Mary Lou listened to Clark
Kent and His Supermen and George Dorn wrote about the sound of one eye opening,
the Fillet of Soul, finding bookings sparse in London, drove into Ingolstadt in
a Volvo painted seventeen Day-Glo colors and flaunting Ken Kesey's old slogan,
&quot;Furthur!&quot; On April 24 a real trickle began, and while Harry Coin
looked into Hagbard Celine's eyes and saw no mercy there (Buckminster Fuller,
just then, was explaining &quot;omnidirectional halo&quot; to his seatmate on a
TWA Whisperjet in m-H-Pacific), the Wrathful Visions, the Cockroaches, and the
Senate and the People of Rome all drove down Ra-thausplatz in bizarre vehicles,
while the Ultra-Violet Hippopotamus and the Thing on the Doorstep both navigated
Friedrich-Ebert-Strasse in even more amazing buses. On April 25, while Carmel
looted Maldonado's safe and George Dorn repeated &quot;I Am the Robot,&quot; the
trickle turned to a stream and in came Science and Health with Key to the
Scriptures, the Glue Sniffers, King Kong and His Skull Island Dinosaurs, the
Howard Johnson Hamburger, the Riot in Cell Block Ten, the House of Frankenstein,
the Signifying Monkey, the Damned Thing, the Orange Moose, the Indigo Banana,
and the Pink Elephant. On April 26 the stream became a flood, and while Saul and
Barney Mul-doon tried to reason with Markoff Chaney and he struggled in their
grip, Ingolstadters found themselves inundated by Frodo Baggins and His Ring,
the Mouse That Roars, the Crew of the Flying Saucer, the Magnificent Ambersons,

began the drum-beating, the Acapulco Gold-Diggers arrived, followed by the Epic
of Gilgamesh, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, Dracula and His Brides, the Iron
Curtain, the Noisy Minority, the International Debt, Three Contributions to the

<p>(But, on April 23, while Joe Malik and Tobias Knight were setting the bomb in
<i>Confrontation's </i>office, the Dealy Lama broadcast a telepathic message to
Hagbard Celine saying <i>It's not too late to turn back </i>and Joe hesitated a
moment, blurting finally, &quot;Can we be sure? Can we be really sure?&quot;
Tobias Knight raised weary eyes. &quot;We can't be sure of anything,&quot; he
said simply. &quot;Celine has popped up at banquets and other social occasions
where Drake was present five times now, and each conversation eventually got
around to the puppet metaphor and Celine's favorite bit about the unconscious
saboteur in everybody. What else can we assume?&quot; He set the timer for 2:30
A.M. and then met Joe's eyes again. &quot;I wish I could have given George a few
more hints,&quot; Joe said lamely. &quot;You gave him too damned many hints as
it is,&quot; Knight replied, closing the bomb casing.)</p>
<p>On April 1, while God's lightning paraded about UN Plaza and Captain Tequila
y Mota was led before a firing squad, John Dillinger arose from his cramped
lotus position and stopped broadcasting the mathematics of magic. He stretched,
shook all over like a dog, and proceeded down the tunnel under the UN building
to Alligator Control. OTO yoga was always a strain, and he was glad to abandon
it and return to more mundane matters.</p>
<p>A guard stopped him at the AC door, and John handed over his plastic
eye-and-pyramid card. The guard, a surly-looking woman whose picture John had
seen in the newspapers as a leader of the Radical Lesbians, fed the card into a
wall slot; it came out again almost at once, and a green light flashed.</p>
<p>&quot;Pass,&quot; she said. <i>&quot;Heute die Welt.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Morgens das Sonnensystem,&quot; </i>John replied. He entered the
beige plastic underworld of Alligator Control, and walked through geodesic
corridors until he came to the door marked MONOTONY MONITOR. After he inserted
his card in the appropriate slot, another green light blinked and the door
opened.</p>
<p>Taffy Rheingold, wearing a mini-skirt and still pert and attractive despite
her years and gray hair, looked up from her typing. She sat behind a beige
plastic desk that matched the beige plastic of the entire Alligator Control
headquarters. A broad smile spread across her face when she recognized him.</p>
<p>&quot;John,&quot; she said happily. &quot;What brings you here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gotta see your boss,&quot; he answered, &quot;but before you buzz him,
do you know you're in another book?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The new Edison Yerby novel?&quot; She shrugged philosophically.
&quot;Not quite as bad as what Atlanta Hope did to me in <i>Telemachus
Sneezed.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I suppose, but how did this guy find out so much? Some of those
scenes are <i>absolutely true. </i>Is he in the Order?&quot; John demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;A mind leak,&quot; Taffy said. &quot;You know how it is with writers.
One of the Illuminati Magi scanned Yerby and he thought he had invented all of
it. Not a clue. The same kind of leak we had when Condon wrote <i>The Manchurian
Candidate.&quot; </i>She shrugged. &quot;It just happens sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; John said absently. &quot;Well, tell your boss I'm
here.&quot;</p>
<p>In a minute he was in the inner office, being effusively greeted by the old
man in the wheelchair. &quot;John, John, it's so <i>good </i>to see you
again,&quot; said the crooning voice that had hypnotized millions; otherwise, it
was hard, in this aged figure, to recognize the once handsome and dynamic
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you get stuck with a job like this?&quot; Dillinger asked
finally, after the amenities had been exchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;You know how it is with the new gang in Agharti,&quot; Roosevelt
murmured. &quot; 'New blood, new blood'—that's their battle cry. All of us old
and faithful servants are being pushed into minor bureaucratic positions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I remember your funeral,&quot; John said wistfully. &quot;I was
envious, thinking of you going to Agharti and working directly with the Five.
And now it's come to this . . . Monotony Monitor in Alligator Control. Sometimes
I get pissed with the Order.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Careful,&quot; Roosevelt said. &quot;They might be scanning. And a
double agent, such as you are, John, is always under special surveillance.
Besides, this isn't really so bad, considering how they reacted in Agharti when
the Pearl Harbor revelations started coming out in the late forties. I did not
handle that matter too elegantly, you know, and they had a right to demote me.
And Alligator Control is interesting.&quot; &quot;Maybe,&quot; John said
dubiously. &quot;I never have understood this project&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's very significant work,&quot; Roosevelt said seriously. &quot;New
York and Chicago are our major experiments in testing the <i>mehum </i>tolerance
level. In Chicago we concentrate on mere ugliness and brutality, but in New York
we're simultaneously carrying on a long-range boredom study. That's where
Alligator Control comes in. We've got to keep the alligators in the sewers down
to a minimum so the Bureau of Sanitation doesn't reactivate their own Alligator
Control Project, which would be an opportunity for adventure and a certain
natural <i>mehum </i>hunting-band mystique among some of the young males. It's
the same reason we took out the trolley cars: Riding them was more fun than
buses. Believe me, Monotony Monitoring is a very important part of the New York
project&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've seen the mental-health figures,&quot; John said, nodding.
&quot;About seventy percent of the people in the most congested part of
Manhattan are already prepsychotic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll have it up to eighty percent by 1980!&quot; Roosevelt cried, with
some of his old steely-eyed determination. But then he fixed a joint in his
ivory holder and, clenching it at his famous jaunty angle, added, &quot;And
we're immune, thanks to Sabbah's Elixir.&quot; He quoted cheerfully: &quot;
'Grass does more than Miltpwn can/ To justify God's ways to man.' But what <i>does
</i>bring you here, John?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A 'small job,' &quot; Dillinger said. &quot;There's a man in my
organization named Malik who is getting a little too close to the secret of the
whole game. I need some help here in New York to set him off on a snark hunt
until after May first I'd like to know who you've got on your staff closest to
him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Malik,&quot; Roosevelt said thoughtfully. &quot;That would be the Malik
of <i>Confrontation </i>magazine?&quot; John nodded, and Roosevelt sat back in
his wheelchair, smiling. &quot;This is a lead-pipe cinch. We've got an agent in
his office.&quot;</p>
<p>(But neither of them realized that ten days later a dolphin swimming through
the rums of Atlantis would discover that no Dragon Star had ever fallen. Nor
could they have guessed how Hagbard Celine would reevaluate Illuminati history
when that revelation was reported to him, and they had no clue of the decision
he would then make, which would change everybody's conspiracies shockingly and
unexpectedly.)</p>
<p>&quot;Here are the five alternate histories,&quot; Gruad said, his wise old
eyes crinkling humorously. &quot;Each of you will be responsible for planting
the evidence to make one <i>ot </i>these histories seem fairly credible. Wo
Topod, you get the Carcosa story. Evoe, you get the lost continent of Mu.&quot;
He handed out two bulky envelopes. &quot;Gao Twone, you get this charming snake
story—I want variations of it scattered throughout Africa and the Near
East.&quot; He handed out another envelope. &quot;Unica, you get the Urantia
story, but that one isn't to be released until fairly late in the Game.&quot; He
picked up the fifth envelope and smiled again. &quot;Kajeci, my love, you get
the Atlantis story, with certain changes that make us out to be the most
double-dyed bastards in all history. Let me explain the purpose behind that
...&quot;</p>
<p>And in 1974 the four members of the American Medical Association gazed
somberly down at Joe Malik from his office wall. It looked to be a long day, and
there was nothing to anticipate as exciting as last night had been. There was a
thick manuscript in a manila envelope in the IN box; he noticed that the stamps
had been removed. That was doubtless Pat Walsh's work; her kid brother was a
stamp collector. Joe smiled, remembering the diary he'd kept when he was a
teen-ager. In case his parents found it, he always referred to masturbation as
stamp collecting. &quot;Collected five stamps today—a new record.&quot;
&quot;After five days of no stamps, collected a beauty in several colors.
Enormous, but the negotiations were tiring.&quot; Doubtless today's kids, if
they kept diaries (they probably used casette tape recorders), either talked
openly about it or considered it too incidental to mention. Joe shook his head.
The Catholic teen-ager he had been in 1946 was no more remote than the crumbling
liberal he'd been in 1968. And yet, in spite of all he'd been through, much of
the time he felt that all of the knowledge didn't make a difference. People like
Pat and Peter still treated him as if he were the same man, and he still did the
same job in the same way.</p>
<p>He took the heavy manuscript out and shook the envelope. Damn it, there was
no return envelope. Well, working at a magazine like <i>Confrontation, </i>whose
contributors were mostly radicals and the kind of kooks who were willing to
write for no bread, you didn't really expect them to enclose stamped
self-addressed envelopes. There was a covering letter. Joe sucked in his breath
when he saw the golden apple embossed in the upper left-hand corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hail Eris and Hi, Joe,</p>
<p>Here is a brilliant, original interpretation of international finance called
&quot;Vampirism, the Heliocentric Theory and the Gold Standard.&quot; It's by
Jorge Loben-gula, a really far-out young Discordian thinker. JAMs don't go in
much for writing, but Discordians, fortunately, do. If you find it worth
printing, you may have it at your usual rates. Make the check payable to the
Fernando Poo Secessionist Movement and sent it to Jorge at 15 Rue Hassan,
Algiers 8.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Jorge will not be involved in the Fernando Poo coup. He is
turning toward a synergistic economics, which will gradually lead him to see the
folly of Fernando Poo going it alone. And the coup itself, of course, will not
be any of our doing. But Jorge will be a key figure in Equatorial Guinea's
subsequent economic recovery—assuming the world pulls through that particular
mess. If you can't use this paper, burn it Jorge has plenty of copies.</p>
<p>Five tons of flax,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mat</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. The Fernando Poo rebellion may still be one or two years in the future,
so don't jump to the conclusion that the pot is coming to a boil already.
Remember what I told you about the goose in the bottle.</p>
<p>M.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Down the hall in the lady's room, bolting the door for privacy, Pat Walsh
takes her transistorized transmitter from her pantyhose and broadcasts to the
receiver at the Council on Foreign Relations headquarters half a block east
&quot;I'm still writing lots of Illuminati research papers, and they'll give him
plenty of false leads. The big news today is an article on Erisian economics by
a Fernando Poo national. It came with a covering letter signed 'Mal,' and from
the context, I feel fairly certain it's the original—Malaclypse the Elder
himself. If not, at last we've got a lead on that damned elusive Malaclypse the
Younger. The envelope was postmarked Mad Dog, Texas . . .&quot;)</p>
<p>Joe put down Mal's letter, trying to remember the obscure references to
Fernando Poo before the movie last night. Someone had said something was going
to happen there. Maybe he should get a stringer on the island, or even send
somebody over. A malicious grin crossed his face: It might be interesting to
send Peter. First some AUM, then a trip to Fernando Poo. That might fix Peter
up.</p>
<p>Joe flipped through the Loberigula manuscript quickly, scanning. There were
no fnords. That was a relief. He had become painfully conscious of them since
Hagbard had removed the aversion reflex, and each fnord had sent a pang through
him that was a ghost of the low-grade emergency in which he had previously
lived. He turned back to the first page and began to read in earnest:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">VAMPIRISM, THE HELIOCENTRIC THEORY AND THE
GOLD STANDARD</span></b></p>
<p>by Jorge Lobengula <i>Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe stopped. That sentence had been used in the Black Mass in Chicago and
further back, he knew, it was the code of the Abbey of Theleme in Rabelais; but
there was something else about it that chewed at his consciousness, something
that suggested a hidden meaning. This was not just a first axiom of
anarchism—there was something else there, something more hermetic. He looked
back at Mal's letter: &quot;Remember what I told you about the goose in the
bottle.&quot;</p>
<p>That was a simple riddle used by Zen Masters in the training of monks, Joe
remembered. You take a newborn gosling and slip it through the neck of a bottle.
Month after month you keep it in there and feed it, until it is a full-grown
goose and can no longer be passed through the bottle's neck. The question is:
Without breaking the bottle, how do you get the goose out?,</p>
<p>Neither riddle seemed to shed much light on the other.</p>
<p><i>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.</i></p>
<p><i>How do you get the goose out of the bottle?</i></p>
<p>&quot;Holy God.&quot; Joe laughed. &quot;Do what <i>thou </i>wilt shall be
the whole of the law.&quot;</p>
<p>The goose gets out of the bottle the same way John Dillinger got out of the
&quot;escape-proof&quot; Crown Point jail.</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus motherfucking Christ,&quot; Joe gasped. <i>&quot;It's
alive!&quot;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">JUST LIKE A TREE THAT'S STANDING BY THE
WAAATER WE SHALL NOT WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED</span></b></p>
<p>The only place where all five Illuminati Primi met was the Great Hall of
Gruad in Agharti, the thirty-thousand-year-old Illuminati center on the peaks of
the Tibetan Himalayas, with a lower-level water front harbor on the vast
underground Sea of Valusia.</p>
<p>&quot;We will report in the usual order,&quot; said Brother Gracchus Gruad,
pressing a button in the table before him so his words would automatically be
recorded on impervium wire for the Illuminati archives. &quot;First of all,
Fernando Poo. Jorge Lobengula, having decided that the combined resources of
Fernando Poo and Rio Muni can be reallocated so as to increase the per-capita
wealth of citizens of both provinces, has accordingly broken with the Fernando
Poo separatists and returned to Rio Muni, where he hopes to persuade Fang
leaders to go along with his schemes for economic redevelopment. Our plans now
center on a Captain Ernesto Tequila y Mota, one of the few Caucasians left on
Fernando Poo. He has good contacts among the wealthier Bubi, the ones who favor
separatism, and he is inordinately ambitious. I don't think we need contemplate
a change in timetable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should hope not,&quot; said Brother Marcus Marconi. &quot;It would be
such a shame not to immanentize the Eschaton on May first&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we can't count on May first,&quot; said Brother Gracchus Gruad.
&quot;But with three distinct plans pointing in that direction, one of them is
bound to hit Let's hear from you, Brother Marcus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charles Mocenigo has now reached Anthrax Leprosy Mu. A few more
nightmares at the right moment and he'll be home.&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Theda Theodora spoke next. &quot;Atlanta Hope and God's Lighting are
becoming more powerful all the time. The President will be scared shitless of
her when the time comes, and he'll be ready to be even more totalitarian than
her, just to keep her from taking over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't trust Drake,&quot; said Brother Marcus Marconi.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Brother Gracchus Gruad. &quot;But he has builded
his house by the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And he who builds by the sea builds on sand,&quot; said Brother Otto
Ogatai. &quot;My turn. Our record, <i>Give, Sympathize, Control, </i>is an
international hit. Our next tour of Europe should be an extraordinary success.
Then we can begin, very slowly and tentatively, negotiations for the <i>Wal-purgisnacht
</i>festival. Anyone who tries to develop the idea prematurely, of course, will
have to be deflected.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or liquidated,&quot; said Brother Gracchus Gruad. He looked down the
long table at the man who sat by himself at the far end. &quot;Now you. You've
been silent all this time. What do you have to say?&quot;</p>
<p>The man laughed. &quot;A few words from the skeleton at the feast, eh?&quot;
This was the fifth and most formidable Illumina-tus Primus, Brother Henry
Hastur, the only one who would have the gall to name himself after a lloigor.
&quot;It is written,&quot; he said, &quot;that the universe is a practical joke
by the general at the expense of the particular. Do not be too quick to laugh or
weep, if you believe this saying. All I can say is, there is a serious threat in
being to all your plans. I warn you. You have been warned. You may all die. Are
you afraid of death? You need not answer—I see that you are. That in itself
may be a mistake. I have tried to explain to you about not fearing death, but
you will not listen. All your other problems follow from that.&quot;</p>
<p>The other four Illuminati Primi listened in cold, disdainful silence and did
not reply.</p>
<p>&quot;If all are One,&quot; the fifth Illuminatus added significantly,
&quot;all violence is masochism.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If all are One,&quot; Brother Otto replied nastily,'&quot;all sex-is
masturbation. Let's have no more <i>mehum </i>metaphysics here.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">HARE KRISHNA HARE HARE</span></p>
<p>&quot;George!&quot;</p>
<p>Then George was here, with Celine, in Ingolstadt. This was going to be
tricky. George's head was bent over an earthenware stein, doubtless full of the
local brew.</p>
<p>&quot;George!&quot; Joe called again. George looked up, and Joe was
astonished. He had never seen George like this before. George shook his
shoulder-length blond hair to clear it away from his face, and Joe looked deep
into his eyes.</p>
<p>They were strange eyes, eves without fear or pity or guilt, eyes that
acknowledged that the natural state of man was one of perpetual surprise, and
therefore could not be greatly surprised by any one thing, even the unexpected
appearance of Joe Malik. What has Celine done to him in the past seven days? Joe
wondered. Has he destroyed his mind or has he—illuminated him?</p>
<p>Actually, it was George's tenth stein of beer that day, and he was very, very
drunk.</p>

<p>Joe Malik, hit by the raga rock as if by an avalanche of separate notes which
were each boulders, felt his body dissolve. Count Dracula wailed it again
(YOU'RE NOT A THING AT ALL), and Joe felt mind crumble along with body and could
find no center, no still point in the waves of sound and energy; the fucking
acid was Hagbard's ally and had turned against him, he was dying; even the words
&quot;Hey that cat's on a bummer&quot; came from far away, and his effort to
determine if they really meant him collapsed into an effort to remember what the
words were, which imploded into an uncertainty about what effort he was trying
to make, mental or physical, and why. &quot;Because,&quot; he cried out,
&quot;because, because—&quot; . . . but &quot;because&quot; meant nothing.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A NOTHING NOTHING BUT A

<p>&quot;But I can't take acid now,&quot; George had protested. &quot;I'm so
damned drunk on this Bavarian beer, it's sure to be a down trip.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody takes acid,&quot; Hagbard said coldly. &quot;Those are Miss
Portinari's orders, and she's right. We can only face this thing if our minds
are completely open to the Outside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, dig,&quot; Clark Kent said. &quot;That French cat eating the
popsicle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah?&quot; said one of the Supermen.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Jean-Paul Sartre. Who'd ever expect to see <i>him </i>here?&quot;
Kent shook his head. &quot;Hope to hell he stays long enough to hear our gig.
Sheee-it, the influence that <i>man </i>has had on me! He should hear it come
back at him in music.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's your trip, baby,&quot; a second Superman said. &quot;I don't

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">YOU'RE NOT A THING AT ALL</span></b></p>
<p>Joe had always had the policy at <i>Confrontation </i>that real screwballs
should be sent to him for interviewing, but the little fat man who came in
didn't seem particularly crazy. He just had the bland, regular, somewhat
smallish features of a typical WASP.</p>
<p>&quot;The name is James Cash Cartwright,&quot; the fat man said, holding out
his hand, &quot;and the subject is consciousness energy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The subject of what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh—this here article I have written for you.&quot; Cart-wright
reached into his alligator briefcase and pulled out a thick sheaf of typewritten
paper. It was an odd size, possibly eight by ten. He handed the manuscript to
Joe. &quot;What kind of paper is this?&quot; said Joe. &quot;It's the standard
size in England,&quot; said Cartwright. &quot;When I was over there in 1963
visiting the tombs of my ancestors, I bought ten reams of it. I took the plane
from Dallas on November 22, the day Kennedy was shot. Syn-chronicity. Also, I
sneezed the moment the gunman squeezed. More synchronicity. But about this
paper, I've never used anything else for my writing since then. Kind of gives a
man a nice feeling to know that all the trees that went into my paper were
chopped down over ten years ago, and no trees have died since then to support
the proliferation of Jim Cartwright's philosophical foliage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That certainly is a wonderful thing,&quot; said Joe, thinking how much
he loathed ecological moralists. During the height of the ecology fad, back in
1970 and '71, several people actually had had the nerve to write Joe saying that
ecologically responsible journals like <i>Confrontation </i>had a duty to cease
publication in order to save trees. &quot;Just what fruit have your
philosophical researches borne, Mr. Cart-wright?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Golden apples of the sun, silver apples of the moon,&quot; said
Cartwright with a smile. Joe saw Lilith Velkor defying Gruad atop the Pyramid of
the Eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Cartwright, &quot;my basic finding is that life
energy pervades the entire universe, just as light and gravity do. Therefore,
all life is one, just as all light is one. All energies, you see, are broadcast
from a central source, yet to be found. If four amino acids—adenine, cytosine,
guanine, and thymine—suddenly become life when you throw them together, then
all chemicals are potentially alive. You and me and the fish and bugs are that
kind of life made from adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine: DNA life. What
we call dead matter is another kind of life: non-DNA-life. Okay so far? If
awareness is life and if life is one, then the awareness of the individual is
just one of the universe's sensory organs. The universe produces beings like us
in order to perceive itself. You might think of it as a giant, self-contained
eye.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe remained impassive.</p>
<p>Cartwright went on. &quot;Consciousness is therefore also manifested as
telepathy, clairvoyance, and telekinesis. Those phenomena are simply
non-localized versions of consciousness. I'm very interested in telepathy, and
I've had a lot of success with telepathic research. These cases of communication
are just further evidence that consciousness is a seamless web throughout the
universe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now wait a minute,&quot; said Joe. &quot;Automobiles run on mechanical
energy, heat energy, and electrical energy, but that doesn't mean that all the
automobiles in the world are in contact with each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What burns?&quot; said Cartwright, smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean in a car? Well, the gas ignites explosively in the
cylinder—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only organic matter burns,&quot; said Cartwright smugly. &quot;And all
organic matter is descended from a single cell. All fire is one. And all
automobiles do communicate with each other. You can't tell me anything about gas
or oil. Or cars. I'm a Texan. Did I tell you that?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe shook his head. &quot;Just what part of Texas are you from?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Little place called Mad Dog.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Had a notion you might be. Tell me, Mr. Cartwright, do you know
anything about a conspiratorial organization called the Ancient Illuminated
Seers of Bavaria?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I know three organizations that have similar names: the Ancient
Bavarian Conspiracy, the New Bavarian Conspiracy, and the Conservative Bavarian
Seers.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe nodded. Cartwright didn't seem to have the facts straight—as Joe knew
them. Perhaps the fat man had other pieces of the puzzle, perhaps fewer pieces
than Joe had. Still, if they were different, they might be useful.</p>
<p>&quot;Each of these organizations controls one of the major TV networks in
the U.S.,&quot; said Cartwright. &quot;The initials of each network have been
intentionally chosen to refer back to the name of the group that runs it. They
also control all the big magazines and newspapers. That's why I came to you.
Judging by the stuff you've been getting away with printing lately, not only do
the Illuminati not control your magazine, but you seem to have the benefit of
some pretty powerful protection.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, there are three separate Illuminati groups, and</p>
<p>among them they dominate all the communications media —is that
correct?&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; said Cartwright, his face as cheerful as if he were
explaining how his wife made ice cream with a hand freezer. &quot;They dominate
the motion-picture industry too. They took a hand in the making of hundreds of
movies, the best known of which are <i>Gunga Din </i>and <i>Citizen Kane. </i>Those
two movies are especially full of Illuminati references, symbols, code messages,
and subliminal propaganda. 'Rosebud,' for instance, is their code name for the
oldest Illuminati symbol, the so-called Rosy Cross. You know what that
means.&quot; He snickered lewdly.</p>
<p>Joe nodded. &quot;So—you know about 'flowery combat.'&quot;</p>
<p>Cartwright shrugged. &quot;Who doesn't? Dr. Horace Nais-mith, a learned
friend of mine, and head of the John Dillin-ger Died for You Society, has
written an analysis of <i>Gunga Din, </i>pointing out the real meaning of the
thuggee, the evil goddess Kali, the pit full of serpents, the elephant medicine,
the blowing of the bugle from the top of the temple, and so forth. <i>Gunga Din </i>celebrates
the imposition of law and order in an area terrorized by the criminal followers
of a goddess who breeds evil and chaos. The thuggee are a caricature of the
Discordians, and the English represent the Illuminati's view of themselves. The
Illuminati love that movie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes I wonder if we're not all working for them, one way or
another,&quot; said Joe, trying deliberately to be ambivalent to see which way
Cartwright would move.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sure we are,&quot; said Cartwright. &quot;Everything we do that
contributes to a lack of harmony in the human race helps them. They are forever
shaking up society with experiments involving suffering and death for large
numbers of people. For instance, consider the <i>General Slocum </i>disaster on
June 15, 1904. Note that 19 plus 04 equals 23, by the way.&quot;</p>
<p>Him too? Joe groaned mentally. He's got to be either one of us or one of
them, and if he's one of them, why is he telling me so much?</p>
<p>&quot;You tell me,&quot; Cartwright said, &quot;if all consciousness is not <i>one,
</i>just how did Joyce happen to pick the very next day for <i>Ulysses, </i>so
the <i>General Slocum </i>disaster would be in the newspaper his characters
read? You see, Joyce knew he was a genius, but he never did understand the
nature of genius, which is to be in better touch with the universal
consciousness than the average man is. Anyway, the Illumi-nati were trying, with
the <i>General Slocum </i>disaster, a new, more economical technique for
achieving transcendental illumination—one that would require only a few
hundred sudden deaths instead of thousands. Not that they care about saving
lives, you understand, though the desire might result from the return of the
repressed original purpose of the Illuminati, which was benign.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; said Joe. &quot;What was the benign purpose?&quot;
'&quot;The preservation of human knowledge after the natural catastrophe that
destroyed the continent of Atlantis and the first human civilization, thirty
thousand years ago,&quot; said Cartwright.</p>
<p>&quot;Natural catastrophe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. A solar flare that erupted just when Atlantis was turned toward
the sun. The original Illuminati were scientists who predicted the solar flare
but were scoffed at by their fellows, so they fled by themselves. The
benevolence of those early Illuminati was replaced by elitist attitudes id their
successors, but the benign purpose keeps coming back in the form of factions
which arise among the Illuminati and split off. The factions preserve
traditional Illuminati secrecy, but they aim to thwart the destructiveness of
the parent body. The Justified Ancients of Mummu were expelled from the
Illuminati back in 1888. But the oldest anti-Illuminati conspiracy is the
Erisian Liberation Front, which splintered off before the beginnings of the
current civilization. Then there's the Discordian Movement—another splinter
faction, but they're almost as bad as the Illuminati. They're sort of like a
cross between followers of Ayn Rand and Scientologists. They've got this guy
named Hagbard Celine, their head honcho. You didn't read about it because the
governments of the world were too scared shitless to do anything about it, but
five years ago this Celine character infiltrated the nuclear-submarine service
of the U.S. Navy for the Illuminati—and stole a sub. He's a supersalesman,
Celine is—he could talk old H. L. Hunt right out of half his oil wells. He was
a Chief Petty Officer. First he converted about half the crew with the most
incredible line of bullshit you've heard since Tim Leary was in his prime. Then
he put some kind of drug in the ship's air supply, and while they were under the
influence he converted most of the others. The ones that were stubborn he just
blew out through the torpedo tubes. Nice guy. Now, mind you, this sub was armed
with Polaris missiles. So the next thing Ce-line does is get himself off to
someplace in the ocean where they can't find him and blackmail the fucking
governments of the U.S., the U.S.S.R., and Red China to each give him ten
million dollars in gold, and after he gets the thirty million he will scuttle
his missiles. Otherwise he will dump 'em on a city of one of those three
countries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was Celine still working for the Illuminati at that point?&quot;
&quot;Hell, no!&quot; Cartwright snorted. &quot;That's not how they play the
game. They like to operate stealthily, behind the throne-room curtains. They
work with poison and daggers and things, not H-bombs. No, Celine told the
Illuminati to go fuck themselves, and there was nothing they could do but grind
their teeth. He's been operating like a pirate ever since. And I'll tell you
something else. There's more than one world leader, including the Illuminati
leaders, that hasn't been able to sleep at night because of what else Hagbard
Celine has on that submarine.&quot; &quot;What's that, Mr. Cartwright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, see, the U.S. Government did a very dumb thing. They weren't
satisfied to have just nuclear weapons aboard their Polaris submarines for a
while. They also thought the subs should be armed with the other kind of
weapon— bugs.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe felt himself go cold, and the back of his neck prickled. Let others worry
about the nuclear devastation all they want. Disease—the extinction of the
human race through the spread of some manmade plague for which man would have no
remedy—was his particular nightmare. Maybe because at the age of seven he'd
very nearly died of polio; though he'd been healthy ever since, the fear of
fatal illness had been impossible to shake.</p>
<p>&quot;This Hagbard Celine—these Discordians—have a bacteriological weapon
aboard the submarine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. Something called Anthrax Tau. All Celine has to do is release it
in the water and within a week the whole human race would be dead. It spreads
faster'n a two-dollar whore on Saturday night. Any living thing can carry it.
But one nice thing about it—it's fatal only to man. If Celine ever gets crazy
enough to use it—and he's pretty crazy these days, and getting worse all the
time—it'll give the planet a fresh start, so to speak. Some other life form
could evolve into sentience. Now, if we have a nuclear war, or if we pollute the
planet to death, there won't be <i>any </i>life left worth talking about. Might
be the best thing that ever happened if Hagbard Celine shot that Anthrax Tau
down the tube. It would sure prevent worse things from happening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If there were no one left alive,&quot; said Joe, &quot;from whose point
of view would it be the best thing that ever happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Life's,&quot; said Cartwright. &quot;I told you, all life is one. Which
gets me back to my manuscript. I'll just leave it with you. I realize it's much
longer than what you usually publish, so feel free to excerpt from it as you
please, and to pay me at your usual rates for whatever you publish.&quot;</p>
<p>That evening Joe stayed till nine at his office. He was, as usual, a day late
getting copy to the typesetter on his editorial column and the letters column.
These were two parts of the magazine that he felt only he could do right, and he
refused to delegate either job to Peter or anyone else on the staff. First he
ran the letters through his typewriter, shortening and pointing them up, then
adding brief editorial answers where called for. After that he put aside his
notes and research for the editorial he'd planned for this August issue, and
instead he wrote an impassioned plea that each reader make himself personally
responsible for doing something about the menace of bacteriological warfare.
Even if what Cartwright had told him was a crock, it reminded him of his
long-held conviction that germ warfare was far more likely to put the quietus to
the human race than nuclear weapons. It was just too easy to unleash. He
envisioned Hagbard in his submarine spewing the microbes of all-destroying
plague out into the seas, and he shuddered.</p>
<p>His briefcase weighed down by Cartwright's manuscript, which he'd decided to
take home with him, he stood in the lobby of his office building, gazing
gloomily at the tanks full of tropical fish in the window of the pet store. One
tank had, as an ornament, a china model of a sunken pirate ship. It made Joe
think again of Hagbard Celine. Did he trust Hagbard or didn't he? Was it
possible to really believe in a Hagbard with the Captain Nemo psychosis,
brooding over tubes and jars full of bacteria cultures, one hairy finger
hovering tentatively over a button that would send a torpedo full of Anthrax Tau
germs out into the inky waters of the Atlantic? Within a week all humans would
die, Cartright had said. And it was hard to think that Cartwright was lying,
since he knew so much about so many other things.</p>
<p>When Joe got home he put on his favorite Museum of National History record, <i>The
Language and Music of the Wolves, </i>and lit up a joint He liked listening to
the wolves when he was high, and trying to understand their language. Then he
took Cartwright's manuscript out of his briefcase and looked at the title page.
It didn't say a word about consciousness energy, indeed, it referred to a
subject Joe found much more interesting:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">HOW THE ANCIENT BAVARIAN CONSPIRACY</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">PLOTTED AND CARRIED OUT</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THE ASSASSINATIONS OF MALCOLM X, JOHN F.
KENNEDY, MARTIN LUTHER KINO, JR., GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL, ROBERT KENNEDY,
RICHARD M. NECON, GEORGE WALLACE, JANE FONDA, GABRIEL CONRAD, AND HANK BRUMMER</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Joe, &quot;I'll be fucked.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;It was quite a trip,&quot; said Hagbard Celine.</i></p>
<p>&quot;You're quite a tripper,&quot; Miss Portinari replied. &quot;You really
did Harry Coin very well. Probably just the way he'll do it, when he gets up the
nerve to come see me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was simpler than doing my own trip,&quot; Hagbard said wearily.
&quot;My guilt is much deeper, because I know more. It was easier to take his
guilt trip than to take my own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it's over? Your fur no longer bristles?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know who I am and why I'm here. Adenine, cytosine, guanine,
thymine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you ever forget?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard grinned. &quot;It's easy to forget. You know that&quot;</p>
<p>She smiled back. &quot;Blessed be, Captain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blessed be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Returning to his stateroom, he was still subdued. The vision of the
self-begotten and the serpent eating its own tail had broken the lines of word,
image, and emotional energy that were steering him toward the Dark Night of the
Soul again—but resolving his personal problem did not rescue the Demonstration
or help him cope with the oncoming disaster. It merely freed him to begin anew.
It merely reminded him that the end is the beginning and humility is endless.</p>
<p>It merely, merrily, turned the Wheel another Tarot-towery connection ...</p>
<p>He realized he was still tripping a little. That was readily fixed: Harry
Coin was tripping, and he wasn't Harry Coin right now.</p>
<p>Hagbard, remembering again who he was and why he was there, opened his
stateroom door. Joe Malik sat in a chair, under an octopus mural, and regarded
him with a level glance.</p>
<p>&quot;Who killed John Kennedy?&quot; Joe asked calmly. &quot;I want a
straight answer this time, H.C.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard relaxed into another chair, smiling gently. &quot;That one finally
registered, eh? I told John, all those years ago, to emphasize that you should
never trust anyone with the initials H.C., and yet you've gone on trusting me
and never noticing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I noticed. But it seemed too wild to take seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;John Kennedy was killed by a man named Harold Can-vera who lived on
Fullerton Avenue in Chicago, near the Seminary Restaurant, where you and Simon
first discussed his theories of numerology. Dillinger had moved back to that
neighborhood for a while in the late fifties, because he liked to go to the
Biograph Theatre for old times' sake, and<sup>1 </sup>Canvera was his landlord.
A very sane, ordinary, rather, dull individual. Then, in Dallas in 1963, John
saw him blow the President's head off before Oswald or Harry Coin or the Mafia
gun could fire.&quot; Hagbard paused to light a cigar. &quot;We investigated
Canvera afterward, like scientists investigating the first extraterrestrial life
form. You can imagine how thorough we were. He had no politics at all at the
time, which puzzled the hell out of us. It turned out that Canvera had put a lot
of money into Blue Sky; Inc., a firm that made devices for landing on
low-gravity planets. That was back La the very early fifties. Finally,
Elsenhower's hostility to the space program drove Blue Sky to the bottom off the
board, and Canvera sold out at a terrible loss. Theft| Kennedy came in and
announced that the U.S. was going toi put a man on the moon. The stocks he'd
sold were suddenly worth millions. Canvera's brain snapped—that was all.
Killing Kennedy and getting away with it turned him schizzy; finally. He went hi
for spiritualism for a while, and then later joined White Heroes Opposing Red
Extremism, one the really paranoid anti-Illuminati groups, and ran a telephone
message service giving WHORE propaganda.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And nobody else ever suspected?&quot; Joe asked. &quot;Canvera is still
there in Chicago, going about his business, just another face on the
street?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not quite. He was shot a few years ago. Due to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Due to <i>me?&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Yes. He was one of the subjects in the first AUM test He subsequently
made the mistake of knocking up the daughter of a local politician. It appears
that the AUM made him susceptible to libertine ideas.&quot;</p>
<h3>WE'RE GONNA ROCK ROCK ROCK TILL BROAD DAYLIGHT</h3>
<p>&quot;You sound very convincing, and I almost believe you,&quot; Joe said
slowly. &quot;Why, all of a sudden? Why no more put-ons and runarounds?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're getting to the chimes at midnight,&quot; Hagbard replied simply,
with a Latin shrug. &quot;The spell is ending. Soon the coach turns back to a
pumpkin, Cinderella goes back to the kitchen, everybody takes their masks off,
and the carnival is over. I mean it,&quot; he added, his face full of sincerity.
&quot;Ask me anything and you get the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you keeping George and me apart? Why do I have to skulk around
the sub like a wanted fugitive and eat with Calley and Eichmann? Why don't you
want George and me to compare notes?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard sighed. &quot;The real explanation for that would take a day. You'd
have to understand the whole Celine System first. In the baby talk of
conventional psychology, I'm taking away George's father figures. You're one:
his first and only boss, an older man he trusts and respects. I became another
very quickly, and that's one of the thousand and one reasons I turned the
guru-hood over to Miss Portinari. He had to confront Drake, the bad father, and
lose you and me, the good fathers, before he could really learn to ball a woman.
The next step, if you're curious, is to take the woman away from him.
Temporarily,&quot; Hagbard added quickly. &quot;Don't be so jumpy. You've been
through a large part of the Celine System, and it hasn't killed you. You're
stronger because of it, aren't you?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe nodded, accepting this, but shot the next question immediately. &quot;Do
you know who bombed <i>Confrontation?&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe. And I know <i>why </i>you did it&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">YOU'RE NOT A THING AT ALL</span></b></p>
<p>&quot;Okay, then, here's the payoff, and your answer better be good. Why are
you helping the Illuminati to immanentize the Eschaton, Hagbard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It steam-engines when it comes steam-engine time, as a very wise man
once said.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus,&quot; Joe said wearily. &quot;I thought I had crossed that <i>pom
asinorum. </i>When I figured out how you get the goose out of the bottle in the
Zen riddle—you do nothing and wait for the goose to peck its way out, just
like a chick pecks its way out of an egg—I realized 'Do what thou wilt'
becomes 'the whole of the law' by a mathematical process. The equation balances
when you realize who the 'thou' is, as distinguished from the ordinary 'you.'
The whole fucking works, the universe—all of it alive in the same way we're
alive, and mechanical in the same way we're mechanical. The Robot. The one more
trustworthy than all the Buddhas and sages. Oh, Christ, yes, I thought I
understood it all. But this, this . . . this stone fatalism—<i>what the hell
are we going to Ingolstadt for, if we can't do anything?&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;The coin has two sides. It's the only coin that comes up at this time,
but it still has two sides.&quot; Hagbard leaned forward intensely. &quot;It's
mechanical <i>and </i>alive. Let me give you a sexual metaphor, since you
usually hang out with New York intellectuals. You look at a woman across a room
and you know you're going to bed with her before the night is over. That's
mechanical: Something has happened when your eyes met But the orgasm is organic;
what it will be like, neither of you can predict. And I know, just as the
Illuminati know, that immanentization is going to happen on May first because of
a mechanical process Adam Weishaupt started on another May first two centuries
ago, and because of other processes other people started before then and since
then. But neither I nor the Illuminati know what form immanentization will take.
It doesn't have to be hell on earth. It can be heaven on earth. And that's why
we're going to Ingolstadt.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">THREE O'CLOCK TWO O'CLOCK ONE O'CLOCK ROCK</span></p>
<p>I became a cop because of Billie Freshette. Well, I don't want to jive
you—that wasn't the whole reason. But she sure as hell was one bodacious big
part of the reason, and that's the curious thing about what finally happened,
and how Milo Flanagan assigned me to infiltrate the Lincoln Park anarchist
group, getting me in right up to my black ass in all that international intrigue
and yoga-style balling with Simon Moon. But maybe I should start over from the
beginning again, from Billie Freshette. I was a little kid and she was an old
woman—it was in the early 1950s, you see (Hassan i Sabbah X was operating in
the open then, going around the South Side preaching that the greatest of the
White Magicians had just died recently in England and now the age of the Black
Magicians was beginning; everybody thought he was one stone-crazy stud), and my
father was a cook in a restaurant on Halsted. He pointed her out to me on the
street once (it must have been just a while before she went back to the
reservation in Wisconsin to die). &quot;See that old woman, child? She was John
Dillinger's girl friend.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I looked, and I saw she was really heavy and together and that whatever
the law had done to her never broke her, but I also saw that sorrow hung around
her like a dark halo. Daddy went on and told me a lot more about her, and about
Dillinger, but it was the sorrow that got printed all over every cell in my
little baby brain. It took years for me to figure it out, but what it really
meant, as an omen or conjure, was that she was basically just like the women of
the black gang leaders on the South Side, even if she was an Indian. There's
just one way for a black in Chicago, and that's to join a gang—Solidarity
Forever, as Simon would say—but I dug that there was only one gang that was
really safe, the biggest gang of all, Mister Charlie's boys, the motherfucking
establishment</p>
<p>I guess every black cop has that in the back of his head, before he finds out
that we never really can join mat gang, not as full members anyway. I found out
quicker, being not just black but female. So I was in the gang, the baddest and
heaviest gang, but I was always looking for something better, the impossible,
the boss gimmick that would get me off the Man's black-and-white chessboard
entirely into some place where I was myself and not just a pawn being moved
around at Charlie's whim.</p>
<p>Otto Waterhouse never had that feeling, at least not until near the end of
the game. I never did get inside his head enough to know what was going on there
(he was a real cop and got into my head almost as soon as we met, and I could
always feel him watching me, waiting for the time when I would round on Charlie
and go over to the other side), so the best I can do in making him is to say
that he was no Tom in the ordinary sense: He didn't screw blacks for the Man, he
screwed blacks for himself; it was strictly his own trip.</p>
<p>Otto was my drop after I got assigned to underground work. We met in a place
that I could always have an excuse to visit, a rundown law firm called
Washington, Weishaupt, Budweiser and Kief, on 23 North Clark. Later, for some
reason I was never told, they changed the name to Ruly, Kempt, Sheveled and
Couth, and then to Weery, Stale, Flatt and Profitable, and to keep up the front
they actually did hire a couple of lawyers and did some real law work for a
corporation called Blue Sky, Inc.</p>
<p>On April 29, still harboring a cargo of doubt about Hag-bard, Joe Malik
decided to try the simplest method of Tar-ot divination. Concentrating all his
energy on the question,' he cut the deck and picked out one card that would
reveal Hagbard Celine's true nature, if the divination worked. With a sinking
heart, he saw that he had come up with the Hierophant Running the mnemonics
Simon had taught him, Joe quickly identified this figure with the number five,
the Hebrew letter <i>Vau </i>(meaning &quot;nail&quot;), and the traditional
interpretation of a false show: a hypocrisy or a trick. Five was the number of <i>Grummet,
</i>the destructive and chaotic end of a cycle. <i>Vau </i>was the letter
associated with quarrels, and the meaning &quot;nail&quot; was often related to
the implement of Christ's death. The card was telling him that Hag-bard was a
hypocritical trickster aiming at destruction, a murderer of the Dreamer-Redeemer
aspect of humanity. Or, taking a more mystical reading, as was usually advisable
with the Tarot, Hagbard only seemed to be these things, and was actually an
agent of Resurrection and Rebirth—as Christ had to die before he could become
the Father, as (in Vedanta) the false &quot;self must be obliterated to join the
great Self. Joe swore. The card was only reflecting his own uncertainty. He
rummaged in the bookshelf Hagbard had provided for his stateroom and found three
books on the Tarot. The first, a popular manual, was absolutely useless: It
identified the Hierophant with the letter of religion in contrast to the spirit,
with conformity, and with all the plastic middle-class values Hagbard
conspicuously lacked. The second (by a true adept of the Tarot) just led him
back to his own confused reading of the card, remarking that the Hierophant is
&quot;mysterious, even sinister. He seems to be enjoying a very secret joke at
somebody's expense.&quot; The third work raised more doubts: It was <i>Liber
555, </i>by somebody named Mordecai Malignatus, which vaguely reminded Joe that
the old <i>East Village Other </i>chart of the Illuminati conspiracy showed a
&quot;Mordecai the Foul&quot; in charge of the Sphere of Chaos—and
&quot;Mordecai Malignatus&quot; was a fair Latinization of &quot;Mordecai the
Foul.&quot; Mordecai, Joe remembered, was, according to that half-accurate and
half-deceptive chart, in dual control (along with Richard Nixon, then living) of
the Elders of Zion, the House of Rothschild, the Politburo, the Federal Reserve
System, the U.S. Communist Party, and Students for a Democratic Society. Joe
flipped the pages to see what the semimythical Mord had to say about the
Hierophant. The chapter was brief; it was in &quot;The Book of Republicans and
Sinners,&quot; and said:</p>

<p>Five stoned men were in a courtyard when an elephant entered.</p>
<p>The first man was stoned on sleep, and he saw not the elephant but dreamed
instead of things unreal to those awake.</p>
<p>The second man was stoned on nicotine, caffeine, DDT, carbohydrate excess,
protein deficiency, and the other chemicals in the diet which the Illuminati
have enforced upon the half-awake to keep them from fully waking.
&quot;Hey,&quot; he said, &quot;there's a big, smelly beast <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">in</span>
our courtyard.&quot;</p>
<p>The third stoned man was on grass, and he said, &quot;No, dads, that's the
Ghostly Old Party in its true nature, the Dark Nix on the Soul,&quot; and he
giggled in a silly way.</p>
<p>The fourth stoned man was tripping on peyote, and he said, &quot;You see not
the mystery, for the elephant is a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>poem
written in tons instead of words,&quot; and his eyes danced.</p>
<p>The fifth stoned man was on acid, and he said nothing, merely worshipping the
elephant in silence as the Father of Buddha.</p>
<p>And then the Hierophant entered and drove a nafl of mystery into all their
hearts, saying, &quot;You are all elephants!&quot;</p>

<p>On April 29 Hagbard invited George to join him on the bridge of the <i>Leif
Erikson. </i>They had been sailing through a smooth-walled tubular passage that
was completely filled with water and was both underground and below sea level It
had been built by the Atlanteans and not only had survived the catastrophe but
had been maintained <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">in</span> good
condition for the next thirty thousand years by the Illuminati. There was even a
salt lock, located, roughly, under Lyon,</p>
<p>France, which served to keep the salt water of the Atlantic out of the
further reaches of the passage and the underground freshwater Sea of Valusia.
The underground waterways were connected with many lakes in Switzerland,
Bavaria, and eastern Europe, Hagbard explained, and if salt water were found in
all of those lakes the existence of the weird subsurface world of the Illuminati
would be suspected. As the submarine approached a huge circular hatchway barring
the passage, Hagbard turned off the devices that rendered the craft
indetectable. Immediately the enormous round metal door swung toward them.</p>
<p>&quot;Won't the Illuminati know we've activated this machinery?&quot; said
George.</p>
<p>&quot;No. This works automatically,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;It's never
occurred to them that anyone else might use this passageway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But they know <i>you </i>could. And you guessed wrong about their
spider-ships being able to detect you.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard whirled on George, a hairy arm lifted to punch him in the chest.
&quot;Shut up about the fucking spider-ships! I don't want to hear any more
about the spider-ships! Portinari's running the show now. And she says it's
safe. Okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Commander, you're out of your fucking mind,&quot; George said firmly.</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed, his shoulders slumping slightly in relaxation. &quot;All
right. You can get off the sub any time you want to. Well just open the hatch
and let you swim out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're out of your fucking mind, but I'm stuck with you,&quot; said
George, clapping Hagbard on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;You're either on the sub or off the sub,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;Watch this.&quot;</p>
<p>The <i>Leif Erikson </i>had sailed through the round metal gateway, which
closed behind it Here the ceiling of the underwater passage was about fifty feet
higher than it had been in the section they just left, and the tunnel was only
partially filling with water. The air seemed to be coming from vents in the
ceiling. There was another metal hatchway in the distance down the tunnel.</p>
<p>&quot;This lock is pretty big,&quot; George said. &quot;The Illuminati must
have sailed some enormous submarines through here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And animals,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>The hatchway ahead of them opened, and fresh water came pouring in. The water
level in the lock rose until it I reached the ceiling, and the <i>Leif Erikson's
</i>engines turned over and began to propel it forward once more. Now George is
writing in his diary again:</p>
<p>April 29</p>
<p>And what the hell does it mean to say that life shouldn't change too rapidly?
How fast is evolution? Do you measure it in terms of lifetime? A year is more
than a lifetime to many kinds of animals, while seventy years is an hour in the
lifetime of a sequoia. And the universe is only ten billion years old. How fast
do ten billion years go? To a god they might go very fast indeed. They might all
happen at once. Suppose the lifetime of your typical basic god was a hundred
quin-tillion years. The whole lifetime of this universe would be to him no more
than the amount of time it takes us to watch a movie.</p>
<p>So, from the point of view of a god or of the universe, things evolve very
quickly. It's like one of those Walt Disney films where you watch a plant
growing before your eyes and the whole cycle from bud to fruit takes about two
minutes. To a god, life is a single organism proliferating in all directions all
over the earth, and now on the moon and Mars, and the whole process from the
first of the protobionts to George Dorn and fellow humans takes no longer than-</p>
<p>Hagbard's voice over the intercom jolted him out of his reverie. &quot;Come
on back up, George. There's more to see.&quot;</p>
<p>This time Mavis was on the bridge with Hagbard. As George entered, Hagbard
withdrew his hand from her left breast in an unhurried movement. George wanted
to kill Hagbard, but he was thankful that he hadn't seen Mavis touching Hagbard
in any sexual way. That would have been past bearing. He might have tested his
new-found courage by taking a poke at Hagbard, and Goddess only knows what
karate or yoga or magic would be the response. Besides, Mavis and Hagbard must
be balling all the time. Who else but Hagbard would a woman like Mavis take for
her regular lover? Who else but Hagbard could satisfy her?</p>
<p>Mavis greeted George with a comradely hug that made the entire front of his
body ache. Hagbard pointed to an inscription carved into the wall of the cave.
There was a row of symbols that George didn't recognize, but above them was
something quite familiar: a circle with a downward-pointing trident carved
inside it</p>
<p>&quot;The peace symbol,&quot; said George. &quot;I didn't know it was that
old.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the days when it was put up there,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;it was
called the Cross of Lilith Velkor, and its meaning is simply that anyone who
attempts to thwart the Illuminati will suffer from the most horrible torture the
Illuminati can devise. Lilith Velkor was one of the first of their victims. They
crucified her on a revolving cross that looked very much like that&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You told me it wasn't really a peace symbol,&quot; said George, looking
wistfully back at the carving, &quot;but I didn't know what you meant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was a Dirigens-grade Illuminatus in Bertrand Russell's circle who
put it in somebody's mind that the circle and trident would be a good symbol for
the Aldermas-ton marchers to carry. It was very cleverly and subtly done. If the
Committee for Nuclear Disarmament had thought about it, what did they need any
kind of a symbol for? But Russell and his people fell for it What they didn't
know was that the circle-and-trident had been a traditional symbol of evil among
left-hand-path Satanists for thousands of years. So many right-wingers are
secret left-hand-path magicians and Satanists that of course they spotted the
symbol for what it was right away. That made them think the Illuminati were
behind the peace movement, which threw them off the track, and they accused the
peaceniks of using a Sa-tanist symbol, which to a small extent discredited the
peace movement. A cute gambit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why is it there on the wall?&quot; said George.</p>
<p>&quot;The inscription warns the passer-by to purify his heart because he is
about to enter the Sea of Valusia, which belongs exclusively to the Illuminati.
Traveling across the Sea of Valusia, you come eventually to the underground port
of Agharti, which was the first Illuminati refuge after the At-lantean
catastrophe. We are emerging into the Sea of Valusia right now. Watch.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard gestured, and George watched, open-mouthed, as the walls of the cave
that closed around them fell away. They were sailing out of the tunnel, but what
they seemed to be entering was an infinite fog. The television cameras and their
laser wave-guides penetrated just as far into this lightless ocean that they
were about to navigate as they had into the Atlantic, but this ocean was neither
blue nor green, but gray. It was a gray that seemed to extend infinitely in all
directions, like an overcast sky. It was impossible to gauge distance. The
farthest depth of the gray around them might be hundreds of miles away, or it
might be right outside the submarine.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's the bottom?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Too far below us to see,&quot; said Mavis. &quot;The top of this ocean
is just a little above the level of the bottom of the Atlantic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're so smart,&quot; said Hagbard, pinching her buttock and causing
George to flinch.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't pay any attention to him, George,&quot; said Mavis. &quot;He's a
little bit nervous, and it's making him silly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut the fuck up,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>Beginning to feel anxious himself, wondering if the noble mind of Hagbard
Celine was being overthrown by the weight of responsibility, George turned to
look out at the empty ocean. Now he saw that it wasn't quite empty. Fish swam
by, some large, some small, many of them grotesque. All were totally eyeless. An
octopoidal monster with extremely long, slender tentacles drifted past the
submarine, feeling for its prey. There was a covering of fine hairs on the tips
of the tentacles. A small fish, also blind, swam close enough to one tentacle to
set up a current that disturbed the hairs. Instantly the octopus's whole body
moved in that direction, the disturbed tentacle wrapped itself around the
hapless fish, and several others joined in to help scoop it up. The octopus
devoured the fish in three bites. George was glad to see that at least the blood
of these creatures was red.</p>
<p>The door behind them opened, and Harry Coin stepped out onto the bridge.
&quot;Morning, everybody. I was just wondering if I might find Miss Mao up
here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's doing her stint in Navigation right now,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;But stay here and have a look at the Sea of Valusia, Harry.&quot;</p>
<p>Harry looked all around, slowly and thoughtfully, then shook his head.
&quot;You know, there's times when I start to think you're doing this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, Harry?&quot; asked Mavis.</p>
<p>&quot;You know&quot;—Harry waved a long, snakelike hand— &quot;doing
this, like a science-fiction movie. You've just got us in an abandoned hotel
somewheres, and you've got a big engine in the basement that shakes the whole
place, and here you've got some movie cameras, only they point at the screen
instead of away from you, if you know what I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rear projection,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Tell me, Harry, what
difference would it make if it wasn't real?&quot;</p>
<p>Harry thought a moment, his chinless face sour. &quot;We wouldn't have to do
what we think we have to do. But even if we don't have to do what we think we
have to do, it won't make any difference if we do it Which means we should just
go ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>Mavis sighed. &quot;Just go ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just go ahead,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;A powerful mantra.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if we don't go ahead,&quot; said George, &quot;it doesn't matter
either. Which means that we just do go ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another powerful mantra,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Just do go
ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>George noticed a small speck in the distance. As it got closer, he
reccognized it He shook his head. Was there no end to the surrealism he'd been
subjected to in the last six days? A dolphin wearing scuba gear!</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, man-friends,&quot; said Howard's voice over the loudspeaker on the
bridge. George cast a glance at Harry Coin. The former assassin was standing
open-mouthed and limp with astonishment</p>
<p>&quot;Greetings, Howard,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;How goes it with the
Nazis?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead, sleeping, whatever it is they are. I have a whole porpoise
horde—most of the Atlantean Adepts—watching them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And ready to perform other tasks as needed, I hope,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;Ready indeed,&quot; said Howard. He turned a somersault.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Harry Com softly. &quot;All <i>right,&quot; </i>he
said more firmly. &quot;It's a talking fish. But why the hell is it wearing an
oxygen tank and breathing through a fucking mask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see we have a new friend on the bridge,&quot; said Howard. &quot;I
got the mask from Hagbard's on-shore representative at</p>
<p>Fernando Poo. After all, a porpoise has to breathe air. And there is no
surface in most of this underground ocean. It's water all the way to the top of
the cavernous chambers that contain it. The only place I can get air near here
is by swimming up to the top of Lake Totenkopf.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Lake Totenkopf monster,&quot; said George with a laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll moor the submarine in Lake Totenkopf later today,&quot; said
Hagbard. &quot;Howard, I'd like you and your people to stand by tonight and
tomorrow night. Tomorrow night be ready to do a lot of hard physical work.
Meanwhile, stay out of the way of the Nazis—the protection they're under is
particularly aimed at sea animals, since that was the presumed greatest danger
to them. We'll have oxygen equipment as needed for any of your people who want
it. Tell them to try to avoid surfacing on the lake unless absolutely necessary.
We don't want to attract more attention than we have to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I salute you in the name of the porpoise horde,&quot; said Howard.
&quot;Hail and farewell.&quot; He swam away.</p>
<p>A little later, sailing on, they saw in the distance an enormous reptile with
four paddles for swimming and a neck twice the length of its body. It was in hot
pursuit of a school of blind fish.</p>
<p>&quot;The Loch Ness monster,&quot; said Hagbard, and George remembered his
little joke about Howard's surfacing in Lake Totenkopf. &quot;One of Gruad's
genetic experiments with reptiles,&quot; Hagbard went on. &quot;He was really
queer for reptiles. He filled the Sea of Valusia with these plesiosaurlike
things. Blind, of course, so they could navigate in darkness. Think about
that—eyes are a liability under certain conditions. Graud figured monsters
like that would be another protection against anybody finding Agharti. But the <i>Leif
Erikson </i>is too big for Nessie to tangle with, and she knows it.&quot;</p>
<p>At last there was a column of yellow light ahead. This was the light let into
the Sea of Valusia by Lake Totenkopf. Hagbard explained that the lake was simply
a place where the ceiling of rock over the Sea of Valusia.had been soft and
unstable enough to collapse. The resulting hole, being at sea level, filled with
water. Debris falling down through the bottom of the lake had formed a mountain
below the place where the roof of the Sea of Valusia was punctured.</p>
<p>&quot;The Jesuits, of course, always knew that Lake Totenkopf connected with
the Sea of Valusia and thus made possible easy contact with Agharti,&quot;
Hagbard said. &quot;That's why, when they gave Weishaupt the assignment of
founding an overt branch of the Illuminati, they sent him to Ingolstadt, which
is right by Lake Totenkopf. And there's the mountain under the lake.&quot;</p>
<p>It loomed ahead of them, dark and forbidding. As the submarine sailed over
it, George saw a cloud of dolphins circling in the distance. The mountain top
had been sheared off in a fashion that seemed too precise to be natural; it
formed a plateau about two miles long and one mile wide. There were what
appeared to be dark squares on this gray plateau. The submarine swooped down,
and George saw that the squares were huge formations of men. In a moment they
were hovering over the army, like a helicopter observing troops on parade.
George could clearly see the black uniforms, the green tanks with
black-and-white crosses painted on them, the long, dark, upjutting snouts of big
guns. They stood there silent and immobile, thousands of feet below the surface
of the lake.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the weapon the Illuminati plan to use to immanentize the
Eschaton?&quot; asked George. &quot;Why don't we destroy them now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because they're under a protective biomystic field,&quot; said Hagbard,
&quot;and we can't. I did want you to see them, though. When the electrical,
Astral, and orgonomic vibrations of the American Medical Association, amplified
by the synergetic clusters of sound, image, and emotional energy of all these
young people responding to the beat, bring that Nazi legion back to life, it
will call for nothing less than the appearance on the field of battle of the
goddess Eris Herself to save the day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard,&quot; George protested disgustedly. &quot;Are you telling me
Eris is real? <i>Really real </i>and not just an allegory or symbol? I can't buy
that any more than I can believe Jehovah or Osiris is really real.&quot;</p>
<p>But Hagbard answered very solemnly, &quot;When you're dealing with these
forces or powers in a philosophic and scientific way, contemplating them from an
armchair, that rationalistic approach is useful. It is quite profitable then to
regard the gods and goddesses and demons as projections of the human mind or as
unconscious aspects of ourselves. But every truth is a truth only for one place
and one time, and that's a truth, as I said, for the armchair. When you're
actually dealing with these figures, the only safe, pragmatic and operational
approach is to treat them as having a being, a will, and a purpose entirely
apart from the humans who evoke them. If the Sorcerer's Apprentice had
understood that, he wouldn't have gotten into so much trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>Approaching the outskirts of the crowd, Fission Chips saw a group of
musicians who were obviously English from their dress and hair style. Their
name, he saw on the biggest drum, was Calculated Tedium, and the guitar play had
a canteen strapped to his hip. It reminded 00005 of how thirsty he was, and he
asked, &quot;Pardon me, do you know where I could get some water or a soft
drink?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take a snort from my canteen,&quot; the guitarist said affably,</p>
<p>passing it over. He pointed to the west. &quot;See that geodesic plywood dome
there? It's a bleeding giant Kool Aid station set up by the Kabouters and
guaranteed to hold out<sup> </sup>even if the crowd doubles in size before this
is over. I just filled the canteen from there, so it's fresh. You can get more
over there any time you need it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; 00005 said warmly, taking a long, cold, delightful
swallow.</p>
<p>He had a very low threshhold for LSD. The world began to seem brighter,

<p>(The joker was actually Rhoda Chief, the vocalist who sang with the Heads of
Easter Island, and who had inspired much admiration in the younger
generation—and much horror in the older—when she named her out-of-wedlock
baby Jesus Jehovah Lucifer Satan Chief. A former Proces-sene and Scientologist,
currently going the Wicca route, the buxom Rhoda was renowned through show biz
for &quot;giving head like no chick alive,&quot; a reputation which often
provoked certain Satanists on the Linda Lovelace for President Committee to send
very deadly vibes in her direction, all of which bounced off due to her Wicca
shield. She was also possibly the greatest singer of her generation, and firmly
believed that most human problems would be solved if the whole world could be
turned on to acid. She had been preparing for the Ingolstadt festival for
several months, buying</p>
<p>only the top-quality tabs from the most reliable dealers, and she had crept
into the geodesic Kool-Aid station only a few moments earlier, dumping enough
pure lysergic acid diethy-lamicte to blow the minds of the population of a small
country. Actually, the idea had been subtly planted in her consciousness by the
leader of her Wiccan, an astonishingly beautiful woman with flaming red hair and
smoldering green eyes who had once played a starring role in a Black Mass
celebrated by Padre Pederastia at 2323 Lake Shore Drive. This woman called
herself Lady Velkor, and often made jokes about her memories of 18th-century
Bavaria, which Rhoda assumed were references to reincarnation.) On April 10,
while Howard made his discovery in the ruins of Atlantis and Tlaloc grinned in
Mexico D.F., Tobias Knight, in his room at the Hotel Pan Kreston in Santa
Isobel, concluded a broadcast to the American submarine in the Bight of Biafra.
&quot;The Russkies and Chinks have completed their withdrawal, and Generalissimo

<p>(Frank Sullivan, capitalizing on his only real asset, was operating in Havana
as a Cuban Superman, using the name Papa Piaba, when the Brotherhood spotted his

And it's only a practical joke, you say?&quot; &quot;It'll be a very funny

pleasantly and concealed her annoyance.</p>

<p>Robinson and Lehrman of the Homicide Department actually started the last
phase of the operation. I was in New York to see Hassan i Sabbah X about a new
phase of Laotian opium operation (I had just come from Chicago, after staging
that conversation with Waterhouse for Miss Servix's benefit), and I decided to
check with them for those little nuances that can't go into an official report
We met in Washington Square and found a bench far enough from the chess nuts to
give us some privacy.</p>
<p>&quot;Muldoon is on to us,&quot; Robinson told me right off. He was wearing a
beard; I figured that meant he was currently in a Weather Underground group,
since he was too old to pass for under twenty-one and get into Morituri.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>He made the usual reply: &quot;Who's ever sure of anything in this business?
But Barney is pure cop through and through,&quot; he added, &quot;and his
instincts are like dowsing rods. Everybody on the force knows we've infiltrated
them by now, anyway. They even make jokes about it 'Who's the CIA man in your
department?'—that kind of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Muldoon is on to us, all right,&quot; Lehrman agreed. &quot;But he's
not the one I worry about&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is?&quot; I brushed my walrus mustache nervously; being the first
pentuple agent in the history of espionage was starting to grind me down. I
really wasn't sure which of my bosses should hear about this, although the CIA
certainly had to be told, since for all I know Robinson and Lehnnan might be
reporting to them twice, having another contact as a fail-safe check on my own
integrity.</p>
<p>&quot;The head of Homicide North,&quot; Lehnnan said. &quot;An old geezer
named Goodman. He's so damned smart, I sometimes wonder if <i>he's </i>a double
agent for the Eye themselves. His mind jumps ahead of facts just like an Adeptus
Exemptus in the Order.&quot;</p>
<p>I looked up at the statue of Garibaldi, remembering the old NYU myth that he
would pull his sword the rest of the</p>
<p>way out of the scabbard if a virgin ever walked through Washington Park.
&quot;Tell me more about this Goodman,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>(&quot;Check out the pair on that chick,&quot; a Superman said
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>(&quot;Watermelons,&quot; a second Superman agreed enthusiastically.
&quot;And you know how us <i>cullud folk </i>dig watermelons,&quot; he added,
licking his lips.</p>
<p>(&quot;Skin!&quot; the first cried.</p>
<p>(&quot;Skin!&quot; the second agreed.</p>
<p>(They slapped palms, and Clark Kent came out of his reverie. Having sampled
the Kool-Aid a while earlier, he was beginning to float a little, although not
yet aware of what was happening—he just felt a rather unusual tug of memory
from his days as an anthropologist, and was deeply concerned with a new insight
about the relationship between the black Virgin of Guadalupe, the Greek goddess
Persephone, and his own sexual proclivities—and he came out of it with a
start, looking at the woman whose breasts had inspired such reverence.</p>
<p>(&quot;Son of a <i>bitch,&quot; </i>he said piously, his mouth spreading in a
grin.)</p>
<p>Rebecca Goodman left the house at 3 P.M., hauling a shopping cart and walking
past the garage. The nearest supermarket was a good ten minutes on foot, and big
enough to keep her busy for a half-hour finding what she wanted and getting
through one of those checkout lines. I slipped out of the car and walked right
to the back of the house, perfectly secure from neighboring eyes in my Bell
Telephone overalls.</p>
<p>The kitchen door had an easy slip-lock, and I didn't even need my keys. A
playing card did the job, and I was in.</p>
<p>My first thought was to head for the bedroom—the old man from Vienna was
right, and that's where you'll find the real clues to a man's character—but
one chair in the kitchen stopped me. The vibes were so strong that I closed my
eyes and psychometered it according to the difficult Third Alko of the A <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

It was Rebecca herself: She had sat there and thought about shooting heroin. It
faded fast, before I could read what had stopped her.</p>
<p>The bedroom almost knocked me over when I found it &quot;Who would have
thought the old man had so much hot blood in him?&quot; I paraphrased, backing
out It was a profan-</p>
<p>ation to read too much in there, and what I did scan was enough. As Miss Mao
would say, this man was Tao-Yin (Beta prime in the terminology of the I). No
wonder Rob inson kept talking about his &quot;intuition.&quot; '</p>
<p>The living room had a statue of the Mermaid of Copenhagen that stopped me. I
read it and chuckled; Lord, the hangups we all have.</p>
<p>One wall was a built-in bookcase, but Rebecca seemed to be the reader in the
family. I started scanning experimentally and found Saul's vibes on a shelf of
detective stories and a <i>Scientific American </i>anthology of mathematical and
logical puzzles. The man had no concept of his own latent powers, and thought
only in terms of solving riddles. Sherlock Holmes, without even the violin and
the dope for relief from all that cortical activity. Everything else went into
his marriage, that hothouse bedroom upstairs.</p>
<p>No; there was a sketchpad on the coffee table. His, according to the aura.</p>
<p>I flipped pages rapidly: all detailed, precise, perfectly naturalistic.
Mostly faces: criminals he had dealt with professionally, all touched with a
perception and compassion that he kept out of his work hours. Trees in Central
Park; Nudes of Rebecca, adoration in every line of the pencil. A surprising face
of a black kid, with some Harem slum building in the background—another touch
of unexpected compassion. Then a switch—the first abstract. It was a Star of
David, basically, but he had started adding energetic waves coming out of it,
and the descending triangle was shaded—somewhere, in the back of his head, he
had been working out the symbolism, and coming amazingly close to the truth.
More faces of obvious criminal types. A scene in the Catskills, with Rebecca
reading a book under a tree— something wrong, gloom and fear in the shading. I
closed my eyes and concentrated: The picture came in with a second woman ... I
opened my eyes, sweating. It was his first wife, and she had died of cancer. He
was afraid of losing Rebecca too, but she was young and healthy. Another man. He
thought she might leave him for a younger man. Well, that was the key, then. I
flipped a few more pages and saw a unicorn—some more of the unconscious work
that went into that erotic Star of David.</p>
<p>A quick scan of Rebecca's books then. Mostly anthropology, mostly African. I
took one off the shelf and held it</p>
<p>Eros again, thinly sublimated. The other part of the key. As Hassan i Sabbah
X once remarked to me, &quot;Breathes there a white woman with soul so dead, she
never yearned for a black in her bed?&quot;</p>
<p>I returned everything to its place carefully and headed for the back door. I
stopped in the kitchen to read the chair again, since relapse is as much a part
of the syndrome in heroin addiction as in black-lung disease. This time I found
what stopped her. If I say love, I'll sound sentimental, and if I say sex, I'll
sound cynical. I'll call it pair bonding and sound scientific.</p>
<p>Slipping back into my car, I checked the time elapsed: seventeen minutes. It
would have taken several hours to unearth as many facts by ordinary detection
methods, and they would have been different, less significant, facts. A <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

<p>There was only one remaining problem: I didn't want to kill anybody at this
point, and a bombing would only get Muldoon in. Even having Malik disappear
might only bring in Missing Persons.</p>
<p>Then I remembered the dummies used by the clothier on the eighteenth floor,
right above the <i>Confrontation </i>office. Burn the dummy just right before
setting the bomb and it might work ... I drove back toward Manhattan whistling
&quot;Ho-Ho-Ho, Who's Got the Last Laugh Now?&quot;</p>
<p>(The bomb went off at 2:30 A.M. one week later. Simon, leaving O'Hare
Airport, where it was 1:30 A.M., decided he still had time to get to the
Friendly Stranger and meet that cute lady cop who had so cleverly infiltrated
the Nameless Anarchist Horde. He could get her into bed easily enough, since
female spies always expect men to reveal secrets when they're in the dreamy
afterglow with their guard down; he would teach her some sexual yoga, he
decided, and see what secrets she might slip. But he remembered the midnight
conference at the UN building after the bomb was set, and Malik's grim words:
&quot;If we're right about this, we might all be dead before Woodstock Europa
opens next week.&quot;)</p>

still tussling with Attila and His Huns, but Hermie &quot;Speed King&quot;
Trismegistos, drummer with the Credibility Gap, watched placidly from only a few
feet away, seeing them as a very complicated, almost mathematical ballet; he was
concerned only with determining whether they illustrated the eternal warfare of
Set and Osiris or the joining of atoms to make molecules. He knew he was on
acid, but, what the hell, that must have been the Kool-Aid, another of Tyl
Eulenspiegel's merry pranks . . .</p>
<p>The submarine rose above the plateau, lifting into the waters of Lake
Totenkopf. Mooring it well below the surface on the shore opposite Ingolstadt,
Hagbard and about thirty of his crew entered scuba launches and buzzed to the
surface. Parked on a road beside the lake was a line of cars, led by a
magnificent Bugatti Royale. Hagbard grandly ushered George, Stella, and Harry
Coin into the enormous car. George was shocked to see that the chauffeur was a
man whose face was covered with gray fur.</p>
<p>It was a long drive around the lake to the town of Ingolstadt. It was very
much as George had imagined it, all turrets and spires and Gothic towers mixed
with modern-Martian edifices straight from Mad Avenue, but most of the buildings
looking like they had been put up in the days of Prince Henry the Fowler.</p>
<p>&quot;This place is full of beautiful buildings,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;The big Gothic cathedral in the center of town is called the
Liebfrauenminister. There's another rococo church called the Maria
Victoria—I've always wanted to get 'stoned on acid and go look at the
carvings, they're so intricate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you been here before, Hagbard?&quot; Harry asked.</p>
<p>&quot;On scouting missions. I know where all the good places are. Tonight
you're all going to be my guests at the Schloss-keller in Ingolstadt
Castle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be your guests,&quot; said George. &quot;None of us have any
money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you have flax,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;you can pay in flax at the
Schlosskeller.&quot;</p>
<p>They went first to the Donau-Hotel, which Hagbard said</p>
<p>was the most modern and comfortable in Ingolstadt, where Hagbard had reserved
almost all the rooms for his people. With every hotel in Ingolstadt bursting at
the seams, it had taken a huge advance payment to bring this off. The hotel's
staff jumped to attention when they saw the line of cars with Hagbard's splendid
Bugatti in the vanguard. Even in a town crowded with celebrities, overrun with
wealthy rock musicians and affluent rock fans from all over the world, a machine
like Hagbard's commanded respect.</p>
<p>George, following Hagbard into the lobby, suddenly found himself face to face
with two ancient, bent German men. One, with a long white mustache and a lock of
white hair that fell over his forehead, said, in heavily accented English,
&quot;Get out of my way, degenerate Jewish Communist homosexual.&quot; The other
old man winced and said something placating to his colleague in a soft voice.
The first man waved his hand in dismissal, and they tottered toward the
elevators together. Several more old men joined them as George watched, too
surprised to be angry. Here, though, in the fatherland of that kind of
mentality, the old man's hatred seemed historical curiosity to him more than
anything else. Doubtless such men as that had actually seen Hitler in the flesh.</p>
<p>Hagbard grandly took a handful of room keys from the desk clerk. &quot;For
simplicity's sake, I've assigned a man and a woman to each room,&quot; he said
as he passed them out. &quot;Choose your roommates and switch around as you
like. When you get up to your rooms you'll find suitable Bavarian peasant
costumes laid out on the bed. Please put them on.&quot;</p>
<p>Stella and George went upstairs together. George unlocked the door and
surveyed the large room with its two double beds. On top of one lay a man's
outfit of lederhosen with silk shirt and knee socks, while on the other bed was
a woman's peasant skirt, blouse, and vest.</p>
<p>&quot;Costumes,&quot; Stella said. &quot;Hagbard's really crazy.&quot; She
shut the door and tugged at the zipper of her one-piece gold knit pantsuit She
had nothing on underneath. She smiled as George regarded her with admiration.</p>
<p>When the group was assembled in the lobby, only Stella looked good in
costume. Of the men, Hagbard looked most natural and happy in lederhosen—which
was, perhaps, why he'd had the notion of dressing that way. Long, skinny Harry
looked ridiculous and uncomfortable, but his buck-toothed grin showed he was
trying to be a good sport</p>
<p>George looked around. &quot;Where's Mavis?&quot; he asked Hag-bard.</p>
<p>&quot;She didn't come with us. She's back minding the store.&quot; Hagbard
raised his arm imperiously. &quot;On to the Schlosskeller.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ingolstadt Castle, a battlemented medieval building built on a hill, had
a magnificent restaurant in what had formerly been either a dungeon or a wine
cellar or both. Hagbard had reserved the entire cellar for the evening.</p>
<p>&quot;Here,&quot; he said, &quot;we'll rally our forces around us, have some
fun, and prepare for the morrow.&quot; He seemed in an agitated, almost giddy
mood. He took his place at the center of a big table in a blackened carved chair
that looked like a bishop's throne. On the wall behind him was a famous
painting. It depicted the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV barefoot in the snow at
Canossa, but with one foot on the neck of Pope Gregory the Great, who lay prone,
his tiara knocked off, his face ignominiously buried in a snowdrift.</p>
<p>&quot;The story goes that this was commissioned by the notorious Bavarian
jester Tyl Eulenspiegel when he was at the height of his fortunes,&quot; Hagbard
said. &quot;Later, when he was old and penniless, he was hanged for his
anarchistic attitudes and his low Bavarian sense of humor. So it goes.&quot;</p>
<p>SHE'LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS</p>
<p>(&quot;There he is!&quot; Markoff Chancy whispers tensely. Saul and Barney
lean forward, peering at the figure ahead of them. About five-seven, Saul
estimates, and Carmel was five-two, according to the R&amp;I packet they had
lifted from Las Vegas police headquarters . . . But who else would be down here,
so far from the route of the guided tours? . . . Saul's hand moves toward his
gun, but the other figure whirls on them, flashing a pistol, and shouts,

<p>SHE'LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS</p>
<p>&quot;Oh Christ,&quot; Saul says disgustedly. &quot;Hail Eris, friend—
we're on the same side.&quot; He holds up his hands, empty. &quot;I'm Saul
Goodman and this is Barney Muldoon, both formerly of the New York Police Force.
This is our friend Markoff Chancy, a man of great imagination and a true servant
of Goddess. All hail Discordia, Twenty-three Ski-doo, Kallisti, and do you need
any more passwords, Mr. Sullivan?&quot;</p>

Dillinger?&quot;</p>
<p>SHE'LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS WHEN SHE COMES</p>
<p>(Rhoda Chief, vocalist and apprentice witch, sampled some of her own Kool-Aid
early in the evening. She swore until the day she died that what happened in
Ingolstadt that <i>Walpurgisnacht </i>was nothing less than the appearance of a
giant sea serpent in Lake Totenkopf. The beast, she insisted, turned, took its
own tail in its mouth, and gradually dwindled to a dot, giving off good vibes
and flashes of Astral Light as it diminished.)</p>
<p>There were many empty places at the big table when the Discordians sat down.
Hagbard seemed in no hurry to order dinner. Instead he called for round after
round of the local beer, of which enormous stocks had been laid in to prepare
for the great rock festival. George, Stella, and Harry Coin sat together near
Hagbard, and George and Harry discussed sodomy objectively, between long,
thoughtful pauses and deep drinking. Hagbard sent the beer around so fast that
George frequently had to swill down a whole stein in a minute or two, just to
keep up. Various people came in and sat down at empty places at the table.
George shook hands with a man around thirty who introduced himself as Simon
Moon. He had a lovely black woman with him named Mary Lou Servix. Simon
immediately began telling everybody about a fantastic novel he had been reading
on the plane coming over. George was interested until he found out that the book
was <i>Telemachus Sneezed, </i>by Atlanta Hope. He didn't see how anyone could
take trash like that seriously.</p>
<p>Just around the time George was finishing his tenth stein of Ingolstadt's
fabled beer and feeling quite woozy, a man who looked very familiar floated into
his line of vision. The man wore a brown suit and horn-rimmed glasses, and his
gray hair was crew-cut.</p>
<p>&quot;George!&quot; the man shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it's me, Joe,&quot; said George. &quot;Of course it's me. That's
you, Joe, isn't it?&quot; He turned to Harry Coin. &quot;That's the guy who sent
me down to Mad Dog to investigate.&quot; Harry laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;My God,&quot; said Joe. &quot;What's happened to you, George?&quot; He
looked vaguely frightened.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of things,&quot; said George. &quot;How many years has it been
since I've seen you, Joe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Years? It's been seven days, George. I saw you just before you caught
the plane to Texas. What have you been doing?&quot;</p>
<p>George shook his finger. &quot;You were holding out on me, Joe. You wouldn't
be here now if you didn't know a lot more than you claimed to when you sent me
to Mad Dog. Maybe good old Hagbard can tell you what I've been doing. There's
good old Hagbard looking over at us from his end of the table right now. What do
you say, Hagbard? Do you know good old Joe Malik?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard lifted a huge, ornamented stein of beer, which the management of the
Schlosskeller had provided him as an honored guest. It was adorned with
elaborate bas-reliefs of pagan woodland scenes, including tumescent satyrs
pursuing chubby nymphs.</p>
<p>&quot;How you doing, Malik?&quot; called Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;Great, Hagbard, just great,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;We're gonna save the earth, aren't we, Joe?&quot; Hagbard yelled.
&quot;Gonna save the earth, that right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus saves,&quot; said George. He began to sing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got the peace that passeth understanding</p>
<p>Down in my heart,</p>
<p>Down in my heart,</p>
<p>Down in my heart.</p>
<p>I've got the peace that passeth understanding</p>
<p>Down in my heart—</p>
<p>Down in my heart—to—stay!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hagbard and Stella laughed and applauded. Harry Coin shook his head and
muttered, &quot;Takes me back. Sure does take me back.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe took a few steps away from George, moving so he could face Hagbard across
the table. &quot;What do you mean, save the earth?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard looked at him stupidly, his mouth hanging open. &quot;If you don't
know that, why are you here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just want to know—we're going to save the earth, but are we going
to save the people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The people that live on the earth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh—those people,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Sure, sure, we're gonna
save <i>everybody.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Stella frowned. &quot;This is the silliest conversation I've ever
heard.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard shrugged. &quot;Stella, honey, why don't you go on back to the <i>Leif
Erikson?&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Well, fuck you, Charley.&quot; Stella stood up and flounced off, her
peasant skirt swinging.</p>
<p>At that moment a little wall-eyed man tapped Joe on the shoulder. &quot;Sit
down, Joe. Have a drink. Sit down with George and me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've seen you before,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps. Come, sit down. Let's have some of this good Bavarian beer. It
has great integrity. Have you ever tried it? Waitress!&quot; The newcomer
snapped his fingers impatiently, all the while staring owlishly at Joe through
lenses as thick as the bottoms of beer glasses. Joe let himself be led to a
chair.</p>
<p>&quot;You look exactly like Jean-Paul Sartre,&quot; said Joe as he sat down.
&quot;I've always wanted to meet Jean-Paul Sartre.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry to disappoint you, then, Joe,&quot; said the man. &quot;Put your
hand into my side.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mal, baby!&quot; Joe cried, attempting to embrace the apparition and
ending up hugging himself while George, bleary-eyed, stared and shook his head.
&quot;Am I glad to see you here,&quot; Joe went on. &quot;But how come you're
doing Jean-Paul Sartre instead of your hairy taxi driver?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a good cover,&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;People would expect
Jean-Paul Sartre to be here, covering the world's biggest rock festival from an
existentialist point of view. On the other hand, this is Lon Chancy, Jr.,
country, and if I started showing up as Sylvan Martiset, with a face covered
with fur, I'd have a mob of peasants carrying torches looking for me all over
town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw a hairy chauffeur today,&quot; said George. &quot;Do you suppose
it was Lon Chancy, Jr.?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry, George,&quot; said Malaclypse with a smile. &quot;The
hairy people are on our side.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; said Joe. He looked around. Hagbard Celine was the
hairiest person at the table. His fingers, hands, and bare forearms were black
with hair. The stubble of his</p>
<p>beard came high up on his cheekbones, just below his eyes. On the back of his
neck the hair didn't stop growing, but continued down into his collar. Stripped,
Joe thought, the man must look like a bear rug. Many of the other people at the
table had long hair or Afro haircuts, and the men had beards and mustaches. Joe
remembered Miss Mao's hairy armpits. The peasant blouses on the women in this
room hid their armpits from examination. George, of course, had that
shoulder-length blond hair that made him look like a Giotto angel. But, Joe
thought, what about me? I'm not hairy at all. I keep my hair in a crew cut
because I prefer it that way. Where does that leave me?</p>
<p>&quot;What difference does hair make?&quot; he asked Malaclypse.</p>
<p>&quot;Hair is the most important thing in this society,&quot; said George.
&quot;I've tried repeatedly to explain that to you, Joe, and you've always never
listened. Hair is the whole thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hair in this society at this moment is a symbol,&quot; said Malaclypse.
&quot;However, there is a real aspect to hair which enables me, for instance, to
look around this room and surmise that many of these people are enemies of the
Illuminati. You see, all humans were once fur-bearing.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe nodded. &quot;I saw that in the movie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, you saw <i>When Atlantis Ruled the Earth, </i>didn't
you?&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;Well, hairlessness, you'll recall, was Gruad's
peculiarity. Most of the people whom the Illuminati permitted to live—and to
eventually become recivilized, Illuminati-style—were mated with or raped by
descendants of Gruad. But the fur-bearing gene, found in all humans before the
catastrophe, has not disappeared. It is quite common in enemies of the
Illuminati. My suspicion is that if we knew the histories of ELF and the
Discordians and the JAMs, we'd find that they go back to Atlantean origins and
preserve to some extent the genes of Gruad's foes. I'm inclined to believe that
hairy people, in whom the genes of Atlanteans other than Gruad predominate, are
inherently predisposed to anti-Illuminati activities. Conversely, people who
work against the Illuminati are also likely to favor lots of hair. These factors
have given rise to legends about werewolves, vampires, beast-men of all kinds,
abominable snowmen, and furry demons. Note the general success of the Illuminati
propaganda campaign to portray all such hirsute beings as fearsome and evil. The
propensity for hairiness among anti-Illuminati types also explains why lots of</p>
<p>hair is a common characteristic of Bohemians, beatniks, leftists generally,
scientists, artists, and hippies. All such people tend to make good recruits for
the anti-Illuminati organizations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes we make it sound as if the Illuminati were the only menace on
earth,&quot; said Joe. &quot;Isn't it equally possible that people who are
opposed to the Illuminati may be dangerous?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes indeed,&quot; said Malaclypse, &quot;Good and evil are two ends
of the same street. But the street was built by the Illuminati. They had
excellent reasons, from their viewpoint, to preach the Christian ethic to the
masses, you know. What is John Guilt?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe remembered what he'd said to Jim Cartwright several years ago: <i>Sometimes
I wonder if we're not all working for them, one way or another. </i>He hadn't
meant it at the time, but now he realized it was probably true. He might be
doing the Illuminati's work right now, when he thought he was saving the human
race. Just as Celine might be doing the will of the Illuminati while thinking
that he was preserving the earth.</p>
<p>George, bleary-eyed and smiling, said, &quot;Where'd you meet Sheriff Jim,
Joe?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe stared at him. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hairlessness is the reason why Gruad and his successors were partial to
reptiles,&quot; said Malaclypse, adjusting his thick glasses. &quot;They had a
real feeling of kinship. One of their symbols was a serpent with its tail in its
mouth, which was intended to refer both to Gruad's Ophidian assassins and to his
other experiments with reptilian lifeforms.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe, still shaken by George's question, yet not wanting to probe further in
that direction, said, &quot;All kinds of myths involving serpents crop up in all
parts of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All of them go back to Gruad,&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;The serpent
symbol and the Atlantean catastrophe gave rise to the myth that Adam and Eve,
tempted by the serpent, fell into misery when they acquired the knowledge of
good and evil. Just as Atlantis fell through the moralistic ideology of Gruad
the serpent-scientist. Then there's the old Norse myth of the World Serpent with
its tail in its mouth that holds the universe together. The Illuminati serpent
symbol was also the origin of the brazen serpent of Moses, the plumed serpent of
the Aztecs, and their legend of the eagle</p>
<p>devouring the snake, the caduceus of Mercury, St. Patrick casting the snakes
out of Ireland, various Baltic tales of the serpent king, legends of dragons,
the monster guarding the fabulous treasure at the bottom of the Rhine, the Loch
Ness monster, and a whole raft of other stories connecting serpents with the
supernatural. In fact, the name 'Gruad' comes from an Atlantean word that
translates variously as 'worm,' 'serpent,' or. 'dragon,' depending on
context.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd say he was all three,&quot; said Joe. &quot;From what I know.&quot;</p>
<p>George said, &quot;I saw the Loch Ness monster today. Hag-bard called it a
she, which surprised me. But this is the first I've heard about this serpent
business. I thought the Illuminati symbol was an eye in a pyramid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Big Eye is their most important symbol,&quot; said Malaclypse,
&quot;but it isn't the only one. The Rosy Cross is another. But most widely
copied is the serpent symbol. The eye in the pyramid and the serpent are often
seen in combination. Together they represent the sea monster Leviathan, whose
tentacles are depicted as serpents and whose central body is shown as an eye in
a pyramid. Since each of Leviathan's tentacles is said to have an independent
brain, that's not half bad. The swastika, which was a pretty important symbol
around these parts some decades ago, was originally a stylized drawing of
Leviathan and his many tentacles. Early versions of it have more than four
hooks, and they often include a triangle, sometimes even an eye-and-trian-gle,
in the center. A common transitional form is a triangle with the sides extended
and then hooked to form tentacle shapes. There are two tentacles for each of the
three angles, which yields a twenty-three. Polish archeologists found a swastika
painted in a cave. The drawing dated back to Cro-Magnon times, not long after
the fall of Atlantis, .and there were twenty-three swirling tentacles around a
beautifully executed pyramid with an ocher eye in its center.&quot;</p>
<p>George held his breath. Mavis had come into the room. Instead of the
peasant-skirt outfit Hagbard had decreed, she was wearing what might have been
called hot lederhosen, a very short, very tight pair of leather breeches that
made her legs look fantastically long and underlined the round curves of her
ass.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow—that's some attractive woman,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you know her?&quot; asked George. &quot;Well, that puts me one up
on you. You're going to meet her.&quot;</p>
<p>Mavis came over, and George said, &quot;Mavis, this is Joe Malik, the guy who
put me in the cell you got me out of.&quot; &quot;That's a little unfair,&quot;
Joe said, taking Mavis's hands with a smile, &quot;but I did send him down to
Mad Dog.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Mavis. &quot;I want to talk with Hagbard.&quot;
She disengaged her hand and walked away. Both Joe and George looked stricken.
Malaclypse merely smiled.</p>
<p>Just then a tall, stern-looking black man came into the room. He too was
wearing Bavarian peasant costume. He went up to Hagbard and shook hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, it's Otto Waterhouse, the infamous killer cop and cop
killer!&quot; roared Hagbard, swilling down beer from his huge stein. Waterhouse
looked pained for a moment, then sat down and surveyed the room through narrowed
eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's my Stella?&quot; he demanded gruffly. George felt his hackles
rise. He knew he had no right of possession where Stella was concerned. But
then, neither did this guy. Exclusive possession seemed the one type of sexual
relationship not practiced among the Discordians and their allies. There was a
kind of tribal, general love among them which didn't prevent anybody from
sleeping with anybody else. An unsympathetic observer might call it
&quot;promiscuity,&quot; but that word, as George understood it, meant using
another's body for sex without feeling anything for the person you were
physically involved with. The Discordians were all too close, too concerned
about each other as people, for the word &quot;promiscuity&quot; to fit their
sex lives. And George loved them all: Hagbard, Mavis, Stella, the other
Discordians, Joe, even Harry Coin, maybe even Otto Waterhouse, who had just
appeared.</p>
<p>Mavis said, &quot;Stella's gone down to the submarine, Otto. She'll join us
at the proper time.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard suddenly lurched to his feet. <i>&quot;Quiet!&quot; </i>he roared. A
silence fell around the smoky room. People stared at Hagbard curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all here now,&quot; he said. &quot;So, I got an announcement to
make. I want you to all join me in drinking to an engagement announcement.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Engagement?&quot; </i>somebody called incredulously.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut the fuck up,&quot; Hagbard snarled. &quot;I'm talking, and if
anybody interrupts me again I'll throw them out. Yes, I'm talking about an
engagement. To be married. Day after tomorrow, when the Eschaton has been
immanentized and all</p>
<p>of this is over—lift your steins—Mavis and I will be married aboard the <i>Leif
Erikson </i>by Miss Portinari.&quot;</p>
<p>George sat there still for a moment, absorbing it, looking at Hagbard. He
looked from Hagbard to Mavis, and tears started to well up in his eyes. He stood
and lifted his stein.</p>
<p>&quot;Here's to ya, Hagbard!&quot; he said, and he drew his arm back in a
sidearm motion so as not to spill any of the beer and then let the whole stein
fly at Hagbard's head. Laughing, Hagbard swayed to one side, a movement so
casual it didn't appear that he was ducking. The stein struck the painted head
of Emperor Henry IV. The painting apparently had been done on a heavy board,
because the stein smashed to bits without marking it. A waiter rushed forward to
wipe the beer away, looking reproachfully at George.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; said George. &quot;Hate to damage a work of art. You
should have kept your head in place, Hagbard. It would have been less of a
loss.&quot; He took a deep breath and roared, &quot;Sinners! Sinners in the
hands of an angry God! You are all spiders in the hand of the Lord!&quot; He
held out his hand, palm upward. &quot;And he holds you over a fiery pit!&quot;
George turned his palm over. He noticed suddenly that everyone in the room was
silent and looking at him. Then he passed out, falling into the arms of Joe
Malik.</p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Exquisite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that what you meant by taking the woman away from him?&quot; said
Joe angrily as he eased George into a chair. &quot;You're a sadistic
prick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's only the first step,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;And I said it was
<i>temporary. </i>Did you see the way he threw that stein? His aim was perfect.
He would have brained me if I hadn't known it was coming.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He should have,&quot; said Joe. &quot;You mean you were' lying about
you and Mavis getting married? You were just saying that to bug George?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He certainly was not,&quot; said Mavis. &quot;Hagbard and I have both
had it with this catch-as-catch-can single life. And I'll never find another man
who more perfectly fits my value system than Hagbard. I don't need anybody
else.&quot; As if to prove that she meant what she said, she knelt abruptly and
kissed Hagbard's hairy left instep.</p>
<p>&quot;A new mysticism,&quot; Simon cried. &quot;The Left-Foot Path.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe looked away, embarrassed by the gesture; then an-</p>
<p>other thought crossed his mind, and he looked back. There was something about
the scene that stirred a memory in him—but was it a memory of the past or of
the future?</p>
<p>&quot;What can I say?&quot; Hagbard asked, grinning. &quot;I love her.&quot;</p>
<p>More food arrived, and Harry Coin leaned over to ask, &quot;Hagbard, are you
dead sure that this goddess, Eris, is real and is going to be here tonight, just
as solid as you and me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You still have doubts?&quot; Hagbard asked loftily. &quot;If you have
seen me, you have seen Our Lady.&quot; And he made a campy gesture.</p>
<p>The man really is going ape, Joe thought. &quot;I can't eat any more,&quot;
he said, motioning the waiter away and feeling dizzy.</p>
<p>Hagbard heard him and shouted, &quot;Eat! Eat, drink, and be merry. You may
never see me again, Joe. Somebody at this table is going to betray me, didn't
you know that?&quot;</p>
<p>Two thoughts collided in Joe's brain: <i>He knows; he is a Magician </i>and <i>He
thinks he's Jesus; he's nuts. </i>But just then George Dorn woke up and said,
&quot;Oh, Jesus, Hagbard, I can't take acid.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed. &quot;The <i>Morgenheutegesternwelt. </i>You're ahead of the
script, George. I hadn't started to hand the acid out yet.&quot; He took a
bottle from his pocket and dumped a pile of caps on the table.</p>
<p>Just then, Joe distinctly heard a rooster crow.</p>
<p>Cars, except for official cars and the vehicles of the performers, their
assistants, and the festival staff, were banned within ten miles of the festival
stage. Hagbard, George, Harry Coin, Otto Waterhouse, and Joe pushed their way
through shuffling crowds of young people. A VW camper carrying Clark Kent and
His Supermen rolled past. Next a huge, black, 1930s-vintage Mercedes slowly made
its way past cheering kids. It was surrounded by a square of motorcyclists in
white overalls to keep eager fans away. Joe shook his head in admiration at the
gleaming supercharger pipes, the glistening hand-rubbed black lacquer, and the
wire-spoked wheels. The landau top of the car was up, but, by peering inside,
Joe could see several crew-cut blond heads. A blond, girl suddenly put her face
to the window and stared out expressionlessly.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the American Medical Association in that Mercedes,&quot; George
said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; said Harry Coin, &quot;we could pitch a bomb into their car
and get all of them right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd kill a lot of other people, too, and leave a lot of unfinished
business hanging fire,&quot; said Hagbard, looking after the Mercedes, which
slowly disappeared down the road ahead of them. &quot;That's a nice machine. It
belonged to Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, one of Hitler's ablest
generals.&quot;</p>
<p>An elephantine black bus carrying the AMA's equipment followed close behind
the Mercedes. Silently it trundled past.</p>
<p>WE'LL KILL THE OLD RED ROOSTER</p>
<p>WE'LL KILL THE OLD RED ROOSTER</p>
<p>The Closed Corporation was generally recognized to be the most esoteric and
experimental of all rock groups; this was why their following, although
fanatical, was relatively small. &quot;It's <i>heavy, </i>all right,&quot; most
of the youth culture said, <i>&quot;but is it really rock?&quot; </i>The same
question, more politely worded, had often been asked by interviewers, and their
leader, Peter &quot;Pall&quot; Mall, had a standard answer: &quot;It's
rock,&quot; he would say somberly, &quot;and on this rock I will build a new
church.&quot; Then he would giggle, because he was usually stoned during
interviews. (Reporters made him nervous.) In fact, the religious tone was rather
prominent when the Closed Corporation appeared in concert, and the chief
complaint was that nobody could understand the chants that accompanied some of
the more interplanetary chords they employed. These chants derived from the
En-ochian Keys which Dr. John Dee had deciphered from the acrostics in the <i>Necronomicon,
</i>and in modern times had been most notably employed by the well-known poet
Aleis-ter Crowley and the Reverend Anton Lavey of the First Church of Satan in
San Fraacisco. On the night of April 30 the Closed Corporation ritually
sacrificed a rooster within a pentagram (it gave one last despairing crow before
they slit its throat), called upon the Barbarous Names, dropped a tab of
mescaline each, and departed for the concert grounds prepared to unleash vibes
that would make even the American Medical Association turn pale with awe.</p>
<p>WE'LL KILL THE OLD RED ROOSTER WHEN SHE COMES</p>
<p>&quot;I just saw Hagbard Celine,&quot; said Winifred Saure.</p>
<p>&quot;Naturally he'd be here with all his minions and catamites,&quot; said
Wilhelm Saure. &quot;We've got to expect to go right down to the wire on
this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder what he's planning,&quot; said Werner Saure.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Wolfgang Saure. &quot;In my opinion he's planning
nothing at all. I know how his mind works—head full of Oriental mystical mush.
He's going to rely on his intuition to tell him what to do. He hopes to make it
more difficult for us to anticipate his actions, since he himself doesn't know
what they will be. But he's wrong. His field of action is drastically limited,
and there's nothing he can do to stop us.&quot;</p>
<p>First the towers appeared over the black-green tops of the pines. They looked
like penitentiary guard towers, though in fact the men in them were unarmed and
their primary purpose was to house spotlights and loudspeakers. Then the road
turned and they were walking next to a twenty-foot-high wire fence. Running
parallel to this was an inner fence thirty feet away and about the same height.
Beyond that were bright green hillsides. The promoters of the fesival had
chopped down and sold all the trees on the hills within the fenced-off area,
bulldozed the stumps, and covered the raw earth with fresh sod. Already the
green was partically covered by crowds of people. Tents had popped up like
mushrooms, and banners waved in the air. Portable outhouses, painted Day-glo
orange to make them easy to spot, were set at regular intervals. A vast hum of
talking, shouting, singing, and music rose over the hills. Beyond the hills,
beyond the central hill where the stage stood, the blue-black waters of Lake
Totenkopf heaved and tossed. Even that side of the festival area had its fences
and towers.</p>
<p>Joe said, &quot;You'd think they were really worried about someone sneaking
in for free.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These people really know how to build this kind of place,&quot; said
Otto Waterhouse.</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed. &quot;Come on, Otto, are you a racist about Germans?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was talking about whites. They've got good big ones in the U.S., too.
I've seen a couple.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never saw one with a geodesic dome, though,&quot; said George.
&quot;Look at how big that thing is. Wonder what's in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I read that the Kabouters were going to set up a dome,&quot;</p>
<p>said Joe. &quot;As a first-aid or bad-trip station, or something like
that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it's a place where you can go hear the music,&quot; said Harry
Coin. &quot;Hell, size of this thing, you can barely see people on the stage,
much less hear them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You haven't heard the loudspeakers they've got,&quot; said Hagbard.
&quot;When the music starts they'll be able to hear it all the way to
Munich.&quot;</p>
<p>They came to a gate. Arching over it was a sign that declared, in red-painted
Gothic letters: EWIGE BLUMENKRAFT</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">UNO EWIGE SCHLANGEKRAFT.</span></p>
<p>&quot;See?&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Right out in the open. For anyone who
understands to read and know that the hour is at hand. They won't be hiding much
longer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Joe, &quot;at least it doesn't say <i>'Arbeit macht
frei.'&quot;</i></p>
<p>Hagbard handed in the orange week-long tickets for his group, and a
black-uniformed usher punched them neatly and returned them. They were inside
the Ingolstadt Festival. As the sun sank over the far side of Lake Totenkopf,
Hagbard and his contingent mounted a hill. A huge sign over the stage announced
that the Oklahoma Home Demonstration Club was playing, and the loudspeakers
thundered out an old favorite of that group: &quot;Custer Stomp.&quot;</p>
<p>Behind the stage the four members of the American Medical Association stood
apart and gazed out at the sunset. They were wearing iridescent black tunics and
trousers. Members of other bands stood together and talked, many of the groups
happy to be meeting each other for the first time. They even fraternized with a
few intrepid kids who managed to infiltrate past the guards and make it to the
back side of the stage hill. But white-suited attendants kept the public and
fellow performers away from the American Medical Association. This was generally
accepted as the AMA's privilege. They were, after all, universally acclaimed as
the greatest rock group in the world. Their records sold the most. Their tours
drew audiences that dwarfed even those of the Beatles. Their sound was
everywhere. As the Beatles had, for a time, expressed the new freedom of the
'60s, so the AMA seemed to epitomize the repressive spirit of the '70s. The
secret of their popularity was that they were so appalling. They reminded their
fans of all the evils that were being daily visited upon them, and thus hearing
and seeing them was like scratching a very bad itch. They suggested that perhaps
youth had captured its oppressors or identified with them, and they momentarily
turned the pain of the whole scene into pleasure. To learn how to enjoy
suffering, since suffering was their lot, kids by the millions flocked to hear
the AMA.</p>
<p>&quot;Like a radiant heater,&quot; said Wolfgang. &quot;We at the center. Our
message projected into a bowl of vibrant young human consciousnesses. Massively
reflected by them back across the lake—into the lake to the depth of a mile.
There, reaching the sunken army. Raising them, in a sense, from the dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are so close to realizing the dream of thirty thousand years,&quot;
said Winifred. &quot;Will we be able to do it? Will we be the ones who complete
the work begun by great Gruad? And, if not, what will become of us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doubtless we will scream in hell for all eternity,&quot; said Werner
matter-of-factly. &quot;What would you do to us if we failed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We need fear eternity only if the Eater of Souls is on the scene,&quot;
said Wilhelm. &quot;And they've still got him imprisoned inside the
Pentagon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let no one speak of failure,&quot; said Wolfgang. &quot;It is
absolutely impossible for us to fail. The plan is foolproof.&quot;</p>
<p>Winifred shook her head. &quot;Fools are precisely what it is not proof
against. And you, Wolfgang, know that best of all.&quot;</p>
<p>It was dark now. The large tent made of cloth-of-gold was sheltered between
the fence and a relatively secluded grassy knoll. There was greatest privacy
here, because this corner of the festival area was farthest from the stage, and
because the area was full of Discordians. Hagbard went into the tent and stayed
there awhile. Joe and George stood outside, talking. George was thinking that
Hagbard was probably in there with Mavis and he wished he could dash in there
and kill the son of a bitch. Joe, agonizingly nervous, suspected that Hagbard
was in the tent with a woman, probably Mavis, and he wondered it he should rush
in and kill Hagbard while the Discordian leader was occupied. He kept his hand
in his pocket, fingers curled around the small pistol.</p>
<p>I circle around, I circle around . . .</p>
<p>After about half an hour Hagbard emerged from the</p>
<p>tent, smiling. &quot;Go on in,&quot; he said to Joe. &quot;You're needed in
there.&quot;</p>
<p>George grabbed Hagbard's arm, trying to sink his fingers in. But the muscle
felt like iron, and Hagbard didn't seem to notice. &quot;Who's in there?&quot;
he demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Stella,&quot; said Hagbard, looking down at the stage, where the
Plastic Canoe was playing.</p>
<p>&quot;And you were fucking her?&quot; Joe asked. 'To release the energies?
And now I'm supposed to fuck her too? And George after me? And then everybody
else? That's left-hand magic, and it's creepy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just go in,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;You'll be surprised. I wasn't
fucking Stella. Stella wasn't in there when I was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who was?&quot; George asked, thoroughly confused.</p>
<p>&quot;My mother,&quot; said Hagbard happily.</p>
<p>Joe turned toward the tent. He would make one more effort to trust Celine,
but then . . . Suddenly the hawk face leaned close to him and Hagbard whispered,
&quot;I know what you're planning for afterwards. Do it quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>SHE'LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS WHEN SHE COMES</p>
<p>On February 2 Robert Putney Drake received a book in the mail. The return
address, he noted, was Gold &amp; Appel Transfers on Canal Street, one of the
corporations owned by that intriguing Celine fellow who had kept appearing at
the best parties for the last year or so. It was titled <i>Never Whistle While
You're Pissing, </i>and the flyleaf had a bold scrawl saying, &quot;Best regards
from the author,&quot;'followed by a gigantic C like a crescent moon. The
publisher was Green and Pleasant Publications, P.O. Box 359, Glencoe, Illinois
60022.</p>
<p>Drake opened it and read a few pages. To his astonishment, several Illuminati
secrets were spelled out rather clearly, although in a hostile and sarcastic
tone. He flipped the pages, looking for other interesting tidbits. Toward the
middle of the book he found:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">DEFINITIONS AND DISTINCTIONS</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FREE MARKET: That condition of society in which all economic transactions
result from voluntary choice without coercion.</p>
<p>THE STATE: That institution which interferes with the Free Market through the
direct exercise of coercion or the granting of privileges (backed by coercion).</p>
<p>TAX: That form of coercion or interference with the Free Market in which the
State collects tribute (the tax), allowing it to hire armed forces to practice
coercion in defense of privilege, and also to engage in such wars, adventures,
experiments, &quot;reforms,&quot; etc., as it pleases, not at its own cost, but
at the cost of &quot;its&quot; subjects.</p>
<p>PRIVILEGE: From the Latin <i>privi, </i>private, and <i>lege, </i>law. An
advantage granted by the State and protected by its powers of coercion. A law
for private benefit.</p>
<p>USURY: That form of privilege or interference with the Free Market in which
one State-supported group monopolizes the coinage and thereby takes tribute
(interest), direct or indirect, on all or most economic transactions.</p>
<p>LANDLORDISM: That form of privilege or interference with the Free Market in
which one State-supported group &quot;owns&quot; the land and thereby takes
tribute (rent) from those who live, work, or produce on the land.</p>
<p>TARIFF: That form of privilege or interference with the Free Market in which
commodities produced outside the State are not allowed to compete equally with
those produced inside the State.</p>
<p>CAPITALISM: That organization of society, incorporating elements of tax,
usury, landlordism, and tariff, which thus denies the Free Market while
pretending to exemplify it.</p>
<p>CONSERVATISM: That school of capitalist philosophy which claims allegiance to
the Free Market while actually supporting usury, landlordism, tariff, and
sometimes taxation.</p>
<p>LIBERALISM: That school of capitalist philosophy which attempts to correct
the injustices of capitalism by adding new laws to the existing laws. Each time
conservatives pass a law creating privilege, liberals pass another law modifying
privilege, leading conservatives to pass a more subtle law recreating privilege,
etc., until &quot;everything not forbidden is compulsory&quot; and
&quot;everything not compulsory is forbidden.&quot;</p>
<p>SOCIALISM: The attempted abolition of all privilege</p>
<p>by restoring power entirely to the coercive agent behind privilege, the
State, thereby converting capitalist oligarchy into Statist monopoly.
Whitewashing a wall by painting it black.</p>
<p>ANARCHISM: That organization of society in which the Free Market operates
freely, without taxes, usury, landlordism, tariffs, or other forms of coercion
or privilege. RIGHT ANARCHISTS predict that in the Free Market people would
voluntarily choose to compete more often than to cooperate. LEFT ANARCHISTS
predict that in the Free Market people would voluntarily choose to cooperate
more often than to compete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drake, now totally absorbed, turned the page. What he found seemed to be an
anthropological report on an obscure tribe he had never heard of; he quickly
recognized it as a satire and a parable. Putting it aside for a moment, he
buzzed his secretary and asked to be connected with Gold and Appel Transfers.</p>
<p>In a moment a voice said, &quot;G and A T. Miss Maris.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Drake calling Mr. Celine,&quot; Drake's secretary said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Celine is on an extended voyage,&quot; Miss Maris replied,
&quot;but he left a message in case Mr. Drake called.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll take it,&quot; Drake said quickly. There was a click as his
secretary went off the line.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Celine will send an emissary to you at the appropriate time,&quot;
Miss Maris said. &quot;He says that you will recognize the emissary because he
will bring with him certain artworks of the Gruad era. I'm afraid that is all,
sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Drake said hollowly, hanging up. He knew the
technique: he had used it himself in moving in on the Syndicate back in 1936.</p>
<p>&quot;You were fucking Stella?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who says I was fucking anybody?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe went in. The tent was as richly hung as that o?any Moorish chieftain. At
one end was a diaphanous veil, behind it a figure on a pile of cushions. The
figure was light-skinned, so Hagbard had been lying about being in here with
Stella. Joe went over and pulled the veil aside.</p>
<p>It was Mavis, all right, just as Joe had guessed. She was wearing harem
pajamas, red but translucent, through which he could see her dark nipples and
the full bush of hair between her legs. At the expectation of making love to
her,</p>
<p>Joe could feel his cock begin to swell. But he was determined to impose his
head trip on this scene.</p>
<p>&quot;Why am I here?&quot; he said, still holding the curtain back with one
hand, trying to assume a casual pose. Mavis smiled faintly and motioned him to
sit down on the cushions beside her. He did so, and found himself automatically
sliding to a half-reclining position. There was a faint suggestion of perfume
from Mavis, and he felt the tension in his loins build up a little more.</p>
<p>&quot;I need all the energies we can set in motion to defeat the
Illuminati,&quot; said Mavis. &quot;Help me, Joe.&quot; She held out her arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Were you fucking Hagbard? I never did like sloppy seconds.&quot;</p>
<p>Mavis gave a little snarl and threw herself on him. She slathered her
drooling lips over his and plunged her tongue deep into his mouth, at the same
time pressing her thigh between his legs. Joe fell back and gave up struggling
against her. She was just too goddamned attractive. In a minute she had his
pants open and his stiff hot prick throbbing in her hand. She lowered her head
over it and began sucking it rhythmically.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; said Joe. &quot;I'm going to go off in your mouth. It's
been a week since I got laid, and I'm on a hair trigger.&quot;</p>
<p>She looked up at him with a smile. &quot;Eat me, then. I hear you're good at
that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who'd you hear that from?&quot; asked Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;A gay priest friend of mine,&quot; she said with a laugh as she undid
the drawstring of her red trousers.</p>
<p>Joe explored the lips of her vulva with his tongue, reveling in the acrid,
musky odor of her bush. He began a businesslike up-and-down, up-and-down motion
with his tongue over her clitoris. After a moment he felt her body tensing. It
grew more and more rigid. Her pelvis began to buck, and he clamped both hands on
her hips and lapped away inexorably. At last she gave a small shriek and tried
to drive her whole mons veneris into his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Now fuck me, quickly, quickly,&quot; she said, and Joe, his pants
pulled down and his shirttail flapping, mounted her. He came in a series of
exquisite spasms and dropped his head to the pillow, beside hers. She let him
rest that way for a few minutes, then gently nudged him to pull out and rolled
to her side to face him.</p>
<p>&quot;Am I dismissed?&quot; Joe said. &quot;Have I done my job? Released the
energies, or whatever?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You sound bitter,&quot; said Mavis, &quot;and sad. I'd like you to stay
with me a while longer. What's bothering you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of things. I feel like I did the wrong thing. George is obviously
in love with you, and you and Hagbard treat it as a joke. And Hagbard treats me
as a joke. And both of you are quite obviously using me. You're using me
sexually, and I'm beginning to think Hagbard is using me in other ways. And I
think you know about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't take the acid, did you?&quot; she said, looking at him
sadly.</p>
<p>&quot;No. I knew what Hagbard was doing. This is too serious a moment to play
games about the Passion of Christ.&quot;</p>
<p>Mavis smiled. She pressed her body closer to him and began playing with his
limp penis, rubbing the head gently into her bush. &quot;Joe, you were raised as
a Catholic. Catholics have a finer appreciation of blasphemy than anybody.
That's why Hagbard chose you. How's your passion, Joe? Is it mounting?&quot;
Pressing her naked body against his, she whispered, &quot;How'd you like to fuck
the Virgin Mary?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe saw his mother's face, and he felt the blood throbbing in his penis. Now
he thought perhaps he knew what Hagbard meant when he said his mother was in the
tent.</p>
<p>A little later, when he was in her, she said, &quot;I am a perpetual virgin,
Joe. And every woman is, if only you have eyes to see. We wanted to give you
eyes tonight. But you refused the Sacrament. You've chosen the hardest way of
all, Joe. If you're going to make it through this night you're going to have to
find a way to see for yourself. By other means than the one Hagbard provided.
You'll have to find your own Sacrament.&quot;</p>
<p>And after she came, and he came, she whispered, &quot;Was that the
Sacrament?&quot;</p>
<p>He pushed himself up and looked down at the triangular red tattoo between her
breasts. &quot;No. You're not the Virgin Mary. You're still Mavis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you still have to make the decision,&quot; she said.
&quot;Good-bye, Joe. Send George to me.&quot;</p>
<p>As Joe was dressing, feeling the weight of the pistol in his trouser pocket,
Mavis rolled over so that she was lying on her stomach, not looking at him. Her
naked buttocks seemed utterly defenseless. He looked at the pillow on</p>
<p>which her bottom had been resting during their lovemak-ing. It was a
cloth-of-gold pillow, and embroidered on it in swirling letters was the word
KALLISTI. Joe shook his head and left the tent.</p>
<p>As he emerged, Hagbard was saying in a low voice to Otto Waterhouse, &quot;.
. . would have been up your alley if we hadn't had other work for you. Anthrax
Leprosy Pi can wipe out the whole population of the earth in a matter of
days.&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the white of Hagbard's shirt, the gold of the tent cloth, the
blazing spotlights of the festival, all were coming in super-bright. That was
adrenalin. My mouth was dry—dehydration. All the classic flight-fight
symptoms. The activation syndrome, Skinner calls it. I was so keyed up that it
was a trip.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Joe,&quot; said Hagbard softly. Joe suddenly realized that his
hand was clenched around the pistol. Hagbard smiled at him, and Joe felt like a
little boy caught playing with himself, with his hand in his pocket. He took his
hand out quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;She wants George,&quot; Joe said weakly. He turned his back on Hagbard
to look down at the stage, where the sign, glowing in the darkness, said LOAF
AND THE FISHES. They were singing, &quot;I circle around, I circle around, the
borders of the earth. . .&quot;</p>
<p>On a pile of cushions behind a diaphanous veil at one end of the tent lay
Stella, wearing nothing but a red chiffon pajama top.</p>
<p>&quot;Were you letting Joe fuck you?&quot; George said. &quot;Joe has never
fucked <i>me,&quot; </i>Stella replied. &quot;You'll be the first person to do
that tonight. Look, George, we've got to get every bit of available energy
flowing to combat the Illu-minati. Come over here and get the energies going
with me.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;This is Danny Pricefixer,&quot; Doris Horus said. &quot;I met him on
the plane coming over.&quot;</i></p>
<p>(&quot;Holy Jesus,&quot; said Maria Imbrium, vocalist with the Sicilian
Dragon Defense, &quot;there are angels coming out of the lake. Angels in golden
robes. Look!&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;You're tripping on that Kabouter Kool-Aid, baby,&quot; a much-bandaged
Hun told her. &quot;There's nothing coming out of the lake.&quot;</p>
<p><i>(&quot;Something </i>is coming out of the lake,&quot; the drummer</p>
<p>with the Sicilian Dragons said, &quot;and you're so stoned you don't see
it.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;And what is it, if it isn't angels?&quot; Maria demanded.</p>
<p>(&quot;Christ, I don't know. But whoever they are, they're walking on the
water.&quot;)</p>
<p><i>Wearing my long green feathers, as I fly,</i></p>
<p><i>I circle around, I circle around . . .</i></p>
<p>(&quot;Jesus. Walking on the water. You people are zonked out of your
skulls.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;It's just a bunch of surfers, wearing green capes for some crazy
reason.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;Surfers? My ass! That's some kind of gang of Bavarian demons. They all
look like the Frankenstein monster wrapped up in seaweed.&quot;)</p>
<p><i>&quot;Pricefixer?&quot; said Kent. &quot;Didn't 1 meet you five or six
years ago in Arkham? Aren't you a cop?&quot;</i></p>
<p>(&quot;It's a gigantic green egg . . . and it <i>loves </i>me . . .&quot;)</p>
<p>John Dillinger muttered to Hagbard, &quot;That red-headed guy over
there—the one with the black musician and the girl with the fantastic boobs.
He's a cop on the New York Bomb Squad. Wanta bet he's here investigating the <i>Confrontation
</i>bombing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He must have been talking to Mama Sutra,&quot; Hagbard said
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>SHE'LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS SHE'LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS</p>
<p>WHEN SHE COMES</p>
<p>When Otto Waterhouse entered the tent, it was Miss Mao who was waiting for
him. &quot;I never fucked a Chinese broad,&quot; said Otto, stripping off his
clothing. &quot;I don't think Stella is going to like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will be okay with Stella,&quot; said Miss Mao. &quot;We need to get
all the energies moving to combat the Illuminati. And we need your help.&quot;
She held out her arms.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have to ask twice,&quot; said Otto, crouching over her.</p>
<p>At 5:45 in Washington, D.C., the switchboard at the Pentagon was warned that
bombs planted somewhere in the building would go off in ten minutes. &quot;You
killed hundreds of us today in the streets of Washington,&quot; said the woman's
voice. &quot;But we are still giving you a chance to evacuate the building. You
do not have time to find the bombs. Leave</p>
<p>the Pentagon now, and let history be the judge of which side truly fought for
life and against death.&quot;</p>
<p>The highest-ranking personnel in the Pentagon (and, with revolution breaking
out in the nation's capital, <i>everybody </i>was there) were immediately moved
to underground bombproof shelters. The Secretary of Defense, after consulting
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declared that there was a 95 percent probability
that the threat was a hoax, intended to disrupt the job of coordinating the
suppression of revolution across the nation. A search would be instituted, but
meanwhile work would go on as usual. &quot;Besides,&quot; the Secretary of
Defense joked to the Chief of Staff, Army, &quot;one of those little radical
bombs would do as much damage to <i>this </i>building as a firecracker would to
an elephant.&quot;</p>
<p>Somehow the fact that the caller had said bombs (plural) had not gotten
through. And the actual explosions were far more powerful than the caller had
implied. Since a proper investigation was never subsequently undertaken, no one
knows precisely what type of explosive was used, how many bombs there were, how
they were introduced into the Pentagon, Where they were placed, and how they
were set off. Nor was the most interesting question of all ever satisfactorily
answered: Who done it? In any case, at 5:55 P.M., Washington time, a series of
explosions destroyed one-third of the river side of the Pentagon, ripping
through all four rings from the innermost courtyard to the outermost wall.</p>
<p>There was great loss of life. Hundreds of people who had been working on that
side of the building were killed. Although the explosion had not visibly touched
their bombproof shelter, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and numerous other high-ranking military persons were found dead; it was assumed
that the concussion had killed them, and in the ensuing chaos nobody bothered to
examine the bodies carefully. After the explosions the Pentagon was belatedly
evacuated, in the expectation that there might be more of the same. There was no
more, but the U.S. military establishment was temporarily without a head.</p>
<p>Another casualty was Mr. H. C. Winifred of the U.S. Department of Justice. A
civil servant with a long and honorable career behind him, Winifred, apparently
deranged by the terrible events of that day of infamy, took the wheel of a
Justice Department limousine and drove wildly, run-</p>
<p>ning twenty-three red lights, to the Pentagon. He raced to the scene of the
explosion brandishing a large piece of chalk, and was trying to draw a chalk
line from one side of the gap in the Pentagon wall to the other when he
collapsed and died, apparently of a heart attack.</p>
<p>At 11:45 Ingolstadt time the loudspeakers and the sign over the stage
announced the American Medical Association. After a ten-minute ovation, the four
strange-eyed, ash-blond young people began to play their most popular song,
&quot;Age of Bavaria.&quot; (In Los Angeles the Mercalli scale on the UCLA
seismograph jumped abruptly to grade 1. &quot;Gonna be a little
disturbance,&quot; Dr. Vulcan Troll said calmly, noting the rise. Grade 1 wasn't
serious.) <i>&quot;What made you think we'd find him down here?&quot; Saul
asked.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Common sense and psychology,&quot; Dillinger said. &quot;I know pimps.
He'd shit purple before he'd get the guts to try to cross a border. They're
strictly mama's boys. The first place I looked was his own cellar, because he
might have a hidden room there.&quot;</p>
<p>Barney laughed. &quot;That's the first place Saul looked, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We seem to think alike, Mr. Dillinger,&quot; Saul said drily.</p>
<p>&quot;There isn't much difference between a cop and a crook, psychologically
speaking,&quot; Dillinger mused.</p>
<p>&quot;One of my own observations,&quot; Hagbard agreed. &quot;What conclusion
do you draw from it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Dillinger said. &quot;Pricefixer didn't just pick up that
girl because he wanted a lay. She has to fit somehow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The musician doesn't know that,&quot; Hagbard commented. &quot;Watch
his hands. He's repressing a fight impulse; in a few minutes he'll start a
quarrel. He and the lady were lovers once—see the way her pelvis tilts when
she talks to him?— and he wants Whitey to go away. But Whitey won't go away.
He has her linked with the case he's working on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I <i>used to be </i>a cop,&quot; Danny said with an engaging imitation
of frankness. &quot;But that was years ago, and the work really didn't appeal to
me. I'm a salesman for <i>Britannica </i>now. Better hours, and people only slam
doors in my face —they don't shoot at me through them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; Doris said excitedly. &quot;The AMA is playing 'Age of
Bavaria.' &quot; It was the song that, more than any other, both expressed and
mocked the aspirations of youth around the world, and the accuracy with which it
expressed</p>
<p>their yearnings and the savagery with which it denied them had won them over.</p>
<p>It started almost the instant the music began. A mile below the surface of
the lake, near the opposite shore, an army began to rise from the dead. The
black-uniformed corpses broke loose from their moorings, rose to the surface,
and began to drift toward shore. As more and more of the semblance of life
returned, the drifting became swimming motions, then wading. They fell into
ranks on the shore. Under the steel helmets their complexions were greenish,
their eyes heavily lidded, their black lips drawn back in wide grimaces. The
mouths of the officers and non-coms moved, forming words of command, though no
sound came forth. No sound was needed, it seemed, for the orders were instantly
obeyed. Once again the power that had been granted to Adolf Hitler by the
Illuminated Lodge in 1923 (&quot;Because you are so preposterous,&quot; they
told him at the time)—the power that had manifested itself in steel-helmed
armies that had won Hitler an empire stretching from Stalingrad to the Atlantic,
from the Arctic Circle to the Sahara Desert—once again that power was visible
on the earth.</p>
<p>&quot;They are coming. I can feel it,&quot; Werner whispered to his twin,
Wilhelm, as Wolfgang thundered on the drums and Winifred belted out:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the dawning of the Age of Bavaria— Age of Bavaria—
Bavaria—Bavaria!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tanks and artillery were rolling into position. The caterpillar treads of
the troop carriers were churning. Motorcycle couriers sped up and down the
beach. A squadron of partially dismantled Stukas was lined up in the road. After
the festivalgoers had been massacred and Ingolstadt had been overrun, the planes
would be trucked to the nearby Ingolstadt Aerodrome, where they would be
assembled and ready to fly by morning.</p>
<p>The dead men removed black rubber sheaths from rolled up red-white-and-black
banners and unfurled them. Many of them were the familiar swastika flags and
banners of the Third Reich, with one addition: a red eye-and-pyramid device
superimposed on the center of each swastika. Other banners carried
Gothic-lettered mottos such as DRANG NACH</p>
<p>OESTEN and HEUTE DIE WELT, MORGENS DAS SONNENSYS-TEM.</p>
<p>At last all was in readiness. The blue-black lips of Gener-al-of-the-SS
Rudolf Hanfgeist, thirty years dead, shaped the command to march, which was
relayed in similar fashion from the higher-ranking officers to the lower-ranking
officers to the men. The lights and music on the opposite shore beckoned across
the dark, bottomless waters. Moonlight glinting on the death's heads on their
caps and runic SS insignia on their collars, the soldiers moved out, company by
company. The only sound was the growl of the diesel engines of troop carriers
and the clank of weapons.</p>
<p>&quot;They're coming,&quot; said the woman under Hagbard, who was neither
Mavis nor Stella nor Mao, but a woman with straight black hair, olive skin,
fierce black eyebrows, and a bony face.</p>
<p>&quot;Coming, Mother,&quot; said Hagbard, giving himself up to the
irresistible onward sweep of sensation to the brink of orgasm and over.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not your mother,&quot; said the woman. &quot;Your mother was a
blond, blue-eyed Norweigian. And I look Greek now, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're the mother of all of us,&quot; said Hagbard, kissing her
sweat-damp neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said the woman. &quot;Is that who I am? Then we're getting
somewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Then I started to flip, Malik eclipsed by Malaclypse and Celine hardly
serene, Mary Lou I Worship You, the Red Eye is my own Mooning, what is the
meaning of moaning? and suchlike seminal semantic antics (my head is a
Quick-tran quicksand where <i>The Territorial Imperative </i>always triggers <i>Stay
Off My Turf, </i>the Latin and the Saxon at' war in poor Simon's synapses, dead
men fighting for use of my tongue, turning Population Explosion into We're
Fucking Overcrowded and backward also, so it might emerge Copulation Explosion,
and besides Hag barred straights from this Black-and-White Mass, the acid was in
me, I was tripping, flipping, skipping, ripping, on my Way with Maotsey Taot-sey
for the number of Our Lady is an hundred and fifty and six—there is
Wiccadom!), but I never expected it this way.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you see?&quot; I asked Mary Lou.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people who were swimming, coming out of the lake. What do you
see?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not what I'm supposed to see.&quot;</p>
<p>For the front line, clear as <i>claritas, </i>was Mescalito from my peyote
visions and Osiris with enormous female breasts and Spider Man and the Tarot
Magus and Good Old Charlie Brown and Bugs Bunny with a Tommy gun and Jughead and
Archie and Captain America and Hermes Thrice-Blessed and Zeus and Athene and
Zagreus with his lynxes and panthers and Micky Mouse and Superman and Santa
Claus and Laughing Buddha Jesus and a million million birds, canaries and
budgies and, gaunt herons and holy crows and crowly hose and eagles and hawks
and mourning doves (for mourning never ends), and they'd all been stoned since
the late Devonian period, when they first started eating hemp seeds, no wonder
Huxley found birds &quot;the most emotional class of life,&quot; singing all the
time, stoned out of their bird-brained skulls, all singing &quot;I circle
around, I circle around,&quot; except the mynah Birds squawking &quot;Here,
kitty-kitty-kitty!&quot; and I remembered again that existence isn't sensible
any more than it's hot or red or high or sour, only parts of existence have
those qualities, and then there was the Zig-Zag man and my God my god my father
leading them in singing</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">SOLIDARITY FOREVER</span></b></p>

<p>&quot;I say,&quot; said an Englishman, &quot;I thought he was a monster, and
he's only Toad of Toad Hall . . . with Rat . . . and Tinker Bell . . . and Wendy
. . . and Bottom . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's who <i>you </i>are,&quot; said Hagbard, &quot;if you can call
that any kind of a fucking identity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's time you went up on stage and made our little
announcement,&quot; said the woman. &quot;I think everyone is ready for
that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll send Dillinger in to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goody!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not true, you know. That was the other guy, Sullivan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't thinking about that. I don't care if it's no bigger than my
little finger. It's just the idea of fucking with <i>John Dillinger. </i>If that
doesn't put me over, nothing will.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard stood up and laughed. &quot;You're starting to look</p>
<p>and sound like Mavis again. I think you're slipping, Super-bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>The American Medical Association had left the stage, and Clark Kent and His
Supermen were playing as Hag-bard, accompanied by George, Harry, Otto, and
Mala-clypse, made his way down their own hill and up to the crest of the hill
where the stage was erected. The journey took a half-hour as they picked their
way through groups of people engaged in Mongolian clusterfuck, sitting Za-Zen,
or just listening to the music. At the stage Hagbard took out a gold card, which
he showed to a group of marshals guarding the area from intrusion. &quot;I have
an announcement to make,&quot; he said firmly. The marshals allowed him to climb
on stage, and told him to wait till the Supermen had finished their set.</p>
<p>As soon as Pearson saw Hagbard he motioned his men to stop playing. A murmur
arose from the audience. &quot;Well, all right, Hagbard,&quot; said Robert
Pearson, &quot;I was wondering if you were ever going to show up.&quot; He
walked over to the side of the stage where Hagbard and his group were standing.</p>
<p>&quot;Good evening, Waterhouse,&quot; said Pearson. &quot;How's my gal,
Stella?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where the fuck do you get off calling her your girl?&quot; said
Waterhouse, his tone containing nothing but menace.</p>
<p>&quot;The acid only opens your eyes, George. It doesn't work miracles.&quot;</p>
<p><i>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever call on the name of the Lord
shall be saved.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Wonder what the hell is in that suitcase,&quot; Dillinger murmured.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll open it,&quot; Saul said. &quot;We'll all have to take the
antidote anyway, after this. I have a supply out in the car.&quot; And he leaned
forward, parted Carmel's stiff blue hands, and tugged the suitcase free. Barney,
Dillinger, and Mar-koff Chancy crowded close to look as he snapped the lock and
lifted the top.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll be damned and double damned,&quot; Barney Muldoon said in a small,
hollow voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard has been putting us on all along,&quot; Simon says dreamily.
(It doesn't matter in the First Bardo.) &quot;Those Nazis have been dead for
thirty years, period. He just brought us here to put us on a Trip. Nothing is
coming out of the lake. I'm hallucinating everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something is happening,&quot; Mary Lou insisted vehemently. &quot;It's
got nothing to do with the lake—that's a red herring to distract us from the
real battle between your Hagbard and those crazy musicians up there. If I wasn't
tripping my head would work better, damn it. It's got something to do with sound
waves. The sound waves are turning solid in the air. Whatever it is, the rest of
us aren't supposed to understand it. This lake thing is just to give us
something we can understand, or almost understand.&quot; Her black face was
intense with intelligence battling against the ocean of undigestible information
pouring in through all of her senses.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Dad!&quot; </i>Simon cried, weeping happily. &quot;Tell me the Word.
You must know now. What is the Word?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kether,&quot; said Tim Moon blissfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Kether? That's all? Just Cabalism?&quot; Simon shook his head. &quot;It
can't be that simple.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kether,&quot; Tim Moon repeats firmly. &quot;Right here in the middle
of Malkuth. As above, so below.&quot;</p>
<p>I see the throne of the world. One single chair twenty-three feet off the
ground, studded with seventeen rubies, and brooding over it the serpent
swallowing its tail, the Rosy Cross, and the Eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Who was that nice man?&quot; Mary Lou asked.</p>
<p>&quot;My father,&quot; Simon said, really weeping now. &quot;And I may never
see him again. Mourning never ends.&quot;</p>
<p>And then I understood why Hagbard had given us the acid—why the Weather
Underground and Morituri used it constantly—because I started to die, I
literally felt myself dwindling to a point and approaching absolute zero. I was
so shit-scared I grabbed Simon's hand and said &quot;help&quot; in a weak voice,
and if he had said &quot;Admit you're a cop first, then I'll help,&quot; I sure
as hell would have told him everything, blurted it all out, but he just smiled,
squeezed my hand gently, and murmured, <i>&quot;Its alive!&quot;—</i>and it
was, the point was giving off light and energy, my light and my energy but God's
also, and it wasn't frightening because it was alive and growing. The word
&quot;omnidirectional halo&quot; came to me from somewhere (was it Hagbard
talking to Dillinger?), and I looked, holy Key-rizt, Dillinger split in two as I
watched. That was the answer to one question: There were two Dillingers, twins,
in addition to the fake Dillinger who got shot at the Biograph, 0 = 2, I
thought, feeling some abstract eternal answer there, along with the answer to
some of the questions that had bugged so many writers about Dillinger's criminal
career (like why some witnesses claimed he was in Miami on that day in 1934 when
other witnesses claimed he was robbing a bank and killing a bank guard in East
Chicago, and why Hagbard had said something about him being in Las Vegas when I
could see him right here in Ingolstadt), but it was all moving, moving, a single
point, but everything coming out of it was moving, a star with swords and wands
projecting outward as rays, a crown that was also a cup and a whirling disc, a
pure white brilliance that said &quot;I am Ptah, come to take you from Memphis
to heaven,&quot; but I only remembered the cops who beat Daddy up in Memphis and
made him swear when he got back that he'd never go south again (and how did that
tie in with why I became a cop?), and Ptah became Zeus, lacchus, Wotan, and it
didn't matter, all were distant and indifferent and cold, not gods of humanity
but gods above humanity, gods of the void, brilliant as the diamond but cold as
the diamond, the three whirling in the point until they became a turning
swastika, then the face of the doctor who gave me the abortion that time I got
knocked up by Hassan i Sabbah X, saying, &quot;You have killed the Son of God in
your womb, black woman,&quot; and I started to weep again, Simon holding my hand
and repeating, <i>&quot;Its alive,&quot; </i>but I felt that it was dying and I
had somehow killed it. I was Otto Waterhouse in reverse: I wanted to castrate
Simon, to castrate all white men, but I wouldn't; I would go on castrating black
men—the Nightmare Life-in-Death am I.</p>
<p>&quot;It's alive, baby,&quot; Simon repeated, &quot;it's alive. And I love
you, baby, even if you are a cop.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;The whole lake is <i>alive,&quot; </i>the vibe man with the Fillet of
Soul was trying to explain to the rest of that group, &quot;one big spiral
rising and turning, like the DNA molecule, but with a hawk's head at the top . .
.&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;Good evening, Waterhouse,&quot; said Pearson. &quot;How's my gal,
Stella?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where the fuck do you get off calling her <i>your </i>girl?&quot; said
Waterhouse, his tone containing nothing but menace.</p>
<p>&quot;Cool it brother,&quot; said Pearson reasonably.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't hand me that brother shit. I asked you a question.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You and your question come out of a weak, limp bag,&quot; said Pearson.</p>
<p>Hagbard said, &quot;Robert only fucks white women, Otto. I'm sure he's never
laid Stella Maris.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be <i>too </i>sure,&quot; said Pearson.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't play with Otto, Robert,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;He specializes
in killing black men. In fact, he's only just killed his first white man, and
he's not at all sure he enjoyed it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never knew what killing was before,&quot; said Waterhouse. &quot;I
was crazy all those years, and I enjoyed what I did because I didn't know what I
was doing. After I killed Flana-gan I understood what I'd been doing all along,
and it was like I killed all the others all over again.&quot; His cheeks were
wet, and he turned away.</p>
<p>Pearson stood looking at him for a moment, then said softly, &quot;Wow. Come
on, Hagbard. Let's get you on stage.&quot; They walked out to the microphone
together. A few people in the audience had begun clapping rhythmically for more
music. Most, though, had been waiting silently, happily, for whatever might
happen next.</p>
<p>What happened was that Robert Pearson said to them, &quot;Brothers and
sisters, this is Freeman Hagbard Celine, my ace, and the heaviest dude on the
planet Earth. Listen while he runs it down to you what's happening.&quot;</p>
<p>He stepped aside and deferentially ushered Hagbard to the microphone.</p>
<p>Into the silence Hagbard said, &quot;My name, as Clark Kent just told you, is
Hagbard Celine . . .&quot;</p>
<p>(In Mad Dog, Texas, John Dillinger and Jim Cartwright looked up from the
chess board as the radio music stopped and an announcer's voice said, &quot;We
interrupt this show to bring you a special message from Washington.&quot; John
moved a knight and said softly, &quot;Checkmate. That'll be the President, I
bet. I hope to hell my brother finds that missing pimp before things get much
worse.&quot; Cartwright surveyed the board dismally. &quot;Checkmate,&quot; he
agreed finally. &quot;I hope your other brother, and Hagbard, are handling
things right in Ingolstadt,&quot; he added, as they both turned, with a reflex
acquired from TV watching, and looked at the radio . . .)</p>
<p>Being a woman is bad enough, but being a black woman is even worse. I always
feel split in two, a divided lion (I'm</p>
<p>thinking like Simon) with a hole in the middle (and that's all men are
interested in, the hole in the middle), but the acid was making the split into a
conscious agony and then was healing it, I was a whole Lion, ready to devour my
enemies: I understood my father and why he felt he finally had to stand up to
the whites even if it killed him. A knight moved across a wasteland, the desert
around Las Vegas, but it was laid out in squares like a chess board; he raised a
fiery wand, crying &quot;Black Power,&quot; and it was Hassan i Sab-bah, my
lover, my enemy, a Black Christ and yet also a baboon with a crazy grin, all
blue pearl gray like semen, inside every woman there's an angry man trying to
get out, a man-woman with the eyes of an owl, and the joy came over me as my
clit got hot and grew into a penis; I was my father; I was afraid of nothing; I
could destroy the world without caring, with one angry flash of my eye, like
Shiva. MY <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">PENIS IS THE INVISIBLE STAR
RUBY AND MEN CONSPIRE TO MAKE ME HIDE IT; THAT'S WHY I MUST TAKE THEIRS.</span></p>

deception is our only defense, I understand it more clearly as the wisdom of my
insanity increases, and the musky smell of hashish coming from the Plastic Canoe

the cross (literally) but the cross is inside a spinning wheel of flame, oh Holy
Moses, I'm finding Buddha not Eris in my pineal gland, the third eye is opening,
I am the earth beneath your feet, I am Billie Freshette, I am legion, there are
millions of me, a plague of locusts to devour your White Male Technology,
&quot;My name is Hagbard Celine&quot; he is saying, they sold heroin in my
grammar school (that's the way a Chicago black gets educated), Simon is still
trying to bring me through it saying now &quot;Death shall have no
dominion,&quot; and I try to believe Love shall have the dominion but first I
must spend my hate to the last penny, they made me kill my baby, I really am
going to go crazy because I have the hots again and want Simon's lance in my cup
but I also know the real God is beyond God and the real Illuminati is beyond the
Illuminati, there's a secret society behind the secret society: The Illuminati
we're fighting are puppets of another Illuminati and so are we.</p>
<p>MY NAME IS HAGBARD CELINE, AND THE CARNIVAL IS OVER. REMOVE YOUR MASKS ALL
PLAYERS.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a funny thing for Toad of Toad Hall to say,&quot; muttered
Fission Chips to nobody in particular. But the voice came booming back MY NAME
IS HAGBARD CE-LINE. PLEASE DON'T PANIC WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY TO YOU
and Chips saw that it wasn't Toad of Toad Hall or even the sinister Saint Toad
but just a well-dressed wop with two faces, one smiling and one frowning in
wrath. &quot;You know,&quot; 00005 said aloud, &quot;I do believe there was a
fucking <i>drug </i>in that water.&quot;</p>
<p>MY NAME IS HAGBARD CELINE. PLEASE DON'T PANIC WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO
SAY TO YOU. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. I HAVE COME TO TELL YOU THAT YOUR LIVES ARE IN
GRAVE DANGER. AT THIS MOMENT AN ARMY IS MARCHING AROUND THE SHORE OF LAKE
TOTENKOPF FOR THE PURPOSE OF MASSACRING ALL THE PEOPLE ATTENDING THIS FESTIVAL.</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus,&quot; said George, &quot;this is never going to work. He's
putting it so badly. They'll never believe him. They'll laugh at him.
Three-quarters of them don't even understand English.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that how it sounds to you?&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;As if he's
speaking in English? It also sounds to me as if he's saying everything in a
flat, direct way. But I hear him speaking in the Greek dialect of Athens in the
fifth century B.C.E.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's actually talking in Norwegian or Italian, whichever language he
knows best. He's using what I call the Pentecost Gimmick. It's described in the
Acts of the Apostles as the gift of tongues. After the death of Jesus the
Apostles were sitting together on the feast of Pentecost, when tongues of fire
appeared over their heads. Then they went out and preached to a crowd of people
from many different countries, and each person heard the sermons in his own
language and in the form most likely to persuade him. They made tens of
thousands of converts to Christianity that way. I was the one who laid the trick
on them, though they never knew that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking in tongues!&quot; said George in wonderment &quot;They used to
preach about it in Bible class: 'And it shall come to pass in the last days,
saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men
shall dream dreams.' &quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;Don't play games with yourself, George. You know perfectly well that a
moment ago I <i>was </i>Mavis.&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;It's a giant black woman . . . it's Goethe's Mother Night,&quot;
somebody was saying, but I was thinking of 69ing with Simon oh the tricks that
cat knows to please a woman to make you feel like a queen on a throne and I
don't care if he knows I'm a cop there's always a sorrow after a joy on this
plane yes I will always be split in two the void will always be there at the
center God yes the mask of night is on my face like I read in Shakespeare in
school I am the river yellow with sewage and cocksucker is a dirty word but what
else is the sign of cancer or that yin-yang all about Christ I loved doing it
women who claim they don't are just liars I hate him and I love him the
ambiguity is always there that detective who wanted to praise me that time said
&quot;You've got balls for a woman&quot; but how would it sound if I said to him
&quot;You've got tits for a man&quot; throne after throne cast down into the
void and yet I have the power all they're worshipping in their trinities and
pyramids are symbols of the cunt and it's hot again but I just want him to hold
me I can't ball now I can't speak I see my father's face but it's silver instead
of tlack and all of a sudden I knew Joe Malik had a gun and even that he had a
silver bullet in it Mother of God does he think Hagbard is something inhuman and
I smelled opium mixed with the hash those are heavy cats in the Plastic Canoe I
could feel the energy surging through me I'm in the tent and I'm being fucked by
all the men I'm Mavis and Stella and I'm the mother of all of them I am Demeter
and Frigga and Cybelle as well as Eris and I am Napthys the Black Sister of Isis
of whom none dare, speak and I can even see why Joe Malik blew up his own office
it was a trap and Hagbard fell into it Joe knows his secret now</p>
<p>&quot;They used to preach about it in Bible class: 'And it shall come to pass
in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions
and your old men shall dream dreams.' And 'All flesh will see it in one
instant.'&quot;</p>
<p>Malaclypse smiled. &quot; 'To conceive of pentecostal training it is
necessary to die. These are the words of the first, last, and between,
Kallisti.' You must have won the prize for memorizing verse in that Bible class,
George.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would have, only the teacher didn't like my attitude.&quot;
&quot;Good,&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;I also taught the Pentecost Gimmick to
Hagbard. What he's saying sounds flat to you, because you don't need to be
persuaded. Everybody else is hearing as much emotion and rhetoric as is needed
to motivate them. It's a good gimmick, the Pentecost Gimmick.&quot; It all came
in solid and three-dimensional and I felt mercy flowing from me like some
psychological monthly with water instead of blood I even forgave the American
Medical Association all four of them separately and distinctly I was Isis all
purple and blue and veiled and even if Poseidon was rising in that lake I could
forgive him too He was covered with olives and shamrocks a green water god
glistening like amethyst with one huge unicorn horn and then he was Indra the
rainmaker whose voice of thunder was only a disguised blessing I obeyed him and
put the doll in the tetrahedron there was nothing to fear for all that would
happen were blessings and good things .as the Brilliant Ones descended bringing
their white fire to the red earth the work would be perfected in pleasure not
pain for I even knew that Joe found out Pat Walsh's memos were misleading
because Hagbard wanted him to find out and wanted him to plant the bomb and even
wanted him to come here tonight with the gun so it all makes sense if you had a
model of the globe with a black light flashing for every death and a white light
for everytime somebody comes it would seem to be glowing all the time that's
what's so good about being a woman I can come and come and come oh God as many
times as I want and men even Simon hardly ever come more than once in a night
that mean Miss Forbes in first grade she needed a good lay but I can even
forgive her</p>

&quot;The resurrected Nazis intend to slaughter all of you. Fortunately, we have
had time to build you a pathway to safety. Behold!&quot; He stretched out his
arm and the spotlight moved beyond him to the lake, illuminating a great pontoon
bridge stretching from the festival area on the eastern shore diagonally to the
lake's northwest corner. It had been silently erected by Hagbard's crew, with
the indispens-</p>
<p>able help of Howard and the dolphins, during the last hour.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow,&quot; George said to Malaclypse. &quot;I suppose you'd call that
the Red Sea Gimmick.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard lifted his hands. &quot;I name that the Adam Weishaupt Bridge.
Everyone will now rise and proceed in an orderly fashion to walk across the
lake.&quot;</p>

American Medical Association and a fight means that somebody is going to lose

<p>&quot;Six hundred and sixty-six,&quot; one of his group answered. &quot;When
you sacrifice a rooster in a pentagram on Walpurgis Night, you always get six

<p>&quot;And they're coming right toward us,&quot; the leader went on in his
dreamy voice. &quot;To bow down and serve us.&quot;</p>

only the Seal of the Chief Executive on the TV screens. The viewers saw the same
confident expression on his face as he floated in Demerol tranquility toward
death. <i>&quot;Oh my God!&quot; </i>said an announcer's voice off screen ... In
Mad Dog, John Hoover Dillinger looks at Jim Cart-wright quizzically. &quot;Whose
conspiracy was behind that?&quot; he asks as the announcer gibbers hysterically.
&quot;There seem to have been five people shooting from five different parts of

and hopelessly ... In New York, August Personage, one of the few people neither

<p>&quot;Are you a turtle?&quot; Lady Velkor asks.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Danny Pricefixer responds.</p>

on the right, &quot;Are you a turtle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can send the army to the west side of the lake to intercept
them,&quot; said Wilhelm.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Nein,&quot; </i>said Wolfgang, who was standing in the rear of the
slowly moving command car, studying the situation through field glasses.
&quot;That <i>verdammte </i>bridge goes toward the northern shore of the lake.
They can go straight, while</p>
<p>our men go around. They'd all be across before we could reach them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We could shell the bridge from here,&quot; said Werner.</p>
<p>&quot;We daren't use the artillery,&quot; said Wolfgang. &quot;We'd have the
whole West German army blundering down here, getting in the way of our drive to
the east. If the West Germans start fighting us, the East Germans will not make
the mistake we want them to make. They won't think we are an invading West
German army. The Russians, in turn, will have plenty of warning. The whole plan
will fall through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's skip this phase, then,&quot; said Winifred. &quot;It's too much
of a hassle. Let's head immediately eastward, and the hell with these
kids.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Nein </i>again, dear sister, my love,&quot; said Wolfgang. &quot;We
have twenty-three candidates for transcendental illumination, including Hitler
himself, waiting up there in the old Fuehrer Suite of the Donau-Hotel. The
speedy mass termination of all those lives is to translate them to eternal life
on the energy plane. And I will not let that <i>Scheisskopi </i>Hagbard Celine
thwart us at this juncture. I mean to show him once and for all which of us is
master. And all the rest of those <i>Schweinen—</i>Dillinger, the Dealy Lama,
Mala-clypse, the old Lady herself, if she's here. If all of them <i>are </i>here,
it's our chance to make a clean sweep and annihilate the opposition once and for
all, at the beginning of the immanentizing of the Eschaton, rather than in the
final stage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we can't catch the kids,&quot; said Wilhelm.</p>
<p>&quot;We can. We shall. It will take a long, long time to move them all
across that pontoon bridge, and they are all on foot. We have vehicles and can
catch up with them before half of them are even on the bridge. They'll all be
bunched together, and those on the bridge will be a perfect target for machine
guns. We shall simply sweep in on them, harvesting their lives as we go. We
spent years building up our identity as the American Medical Association just so
we could organize the Ingolstadt festival and trap masses of human beings on the
shore of Lake Totenkopf, that our sacred lake might run red with their blood.
Would you throw all that away?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I agree. A brilliant analysis,&quot; said Wilhelm.</p>
<p>&quot;We must move on at full speed, then,&quot; said Wolfgang. He turned to
the car behind him and shouted. <i>&quot;Vorwarts</i></p>
<p>at maximum speed!&quot; General-of-the-SS Hanfgeist stood up, turned toward
his subordinates, and moved his blackened lips to form the same words.
Immediately the tanks, halftracks, motorcycles, and armored cars began to rev up
their engines and the troops started to trot down the road on the double.</p>
<p>A lookout in one of the festival light-and-sound towers spotted them and
relayed a warning to the stage, where Robert Pearson spoke into a microphone.
&quot;It is my sad duty to inform you that the pigs are intensifying their
approach. Now, don't run. But <i>do </i>quicken your pace with all deliberate
speed.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard called in through the doorway of the gold tent, &quot;John, you've
had enough, for Discordia's sake. Come on out and let Malaclypse go in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought you were noncorporeal,&quot; said George.</p>
<p>&quot;If you'd known me any length of time you would have noticed that I
frequently pick my nose,&quot; said the Sartrelike apparition.</p>
<p>&quot;Whew,&quot; said John-John Dillinger, emerging from the tent, &quot;who
would have thought the old man'd have so much come in him? She says she wants
George in there after Mal.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman behind the veil was glowing. There was no light in the tent, save
for the deep golden radiance that came from her body.</p>
<p>&quot;Come closer, George,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't want you to make
love to me now—I only want you to learn the truth. Stand here before me.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman behind the veil was Mavis. &quot;Mavis, I love you,&quot; said
George. &quot;I've loved you ever since you took me out of that jail in Mad
Dog.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look again, George,&quot; said Stella.</p>
<p>&quot;Stella! What happened to Mavis?&quot;</p>
<p>I circle around, I circle around . . .</p>
<p>&quot;Don't play games with yourself, George. You know perfectly well that a
moment ago I <i>was </i>Mavis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the acid,&quot; said George.</p>
<p>&quot;The acid only opens your eyes, George. It doesn't work miracles,&quot;
said Miss Mao.</p>
<p>I circle around, I circle around . . .</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, my God!&quot; said George. And he thought: <i>And it</i></p>
<p><i>shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
shall be saved.</i></p>
<p>Mavis was there again. &quot;Do you understand, George? Do you understand why
you never saw all of us together at once? Do you understand why, all the time
you wanted to fuck me, that when you were fucking Stella you <i>were </i>fucking
me? And do you understand that I am not one woman or three women but an infinite
number of women?&quot; Before his eyes she turned red, yellow, black, brown,
young, middle-aged, a child, an old woman, a Norwegian blonde, a Sicilian
brunette, a wild-eyed Greek woman, a tall Ashanti, a slant-eyed Masai, a
Japanese, a Chinese, a Vietnamese, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>The paleface kept turning colors, the way people do when you're on peyote.
Now he looked almost like an Indian. That made it easier to talk to him. Why
shouldn't people turn colors? All the trouble in the world came from the fact
that they usually stayed the same color. James nodded profoundly. As usual,
peyote had brought him a big Truth. If whites and blacks and Indians were
turning colors all the time, there wouldn't be any hate in the world, because
nobody would know which people to hate.</p>
<p>Who the hell's mind was that? George wondered. The tent was dark. He looked
around for the woman. He rushed out of the tent. No one was looking at him. They
were all, Hagbard and the rest of them, staring in awe at a colossal figure that
grew ever taller as it strode away from them. It was a golden woman in golden
robes with wild gold, red, black hair flowing free. She stepped over the fence
that guarded the festival grounds as casually as if it were the threshold of a
door. She towered over the Bavarian pines. In her left hand she carried an
enormous golden orb. .</p>
<p>Hagbard put his hand on George's shoulder. &quot;It is possible,&quot; he
said, &quot;to achieve transcendental illumination though a multiplicity of
orgasms as well as through a multiplicity of deaths.&quot;</p>
<p>There were lights advancing down the road. The woman, now ninety-three feet
tall, strode toward those lights. She laughed, and the laughter echoed across
Lake Totenkopf.</p>
<p>&quot;Great Gruad! What's that?&quot; cried Werner.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the Old Woman!&quot; shouted Wolfgang, his lips falling away from
his teeth in a snarl.</p>
<p>The sudden cry <i>&quot;Kallisti!&quot; </i>reverberated through the Bavarian
hills louder than the music of the Ingolstadt festival had been. Trailing a
cometlike cloud of sparks, the golden apple fell into the center of the
advancing army.</p>
<p>The Supernazis might have been the living dead, but they were still human.
What each man saw in the apple was his heart's desire. Private Heinrich Krause
saw the family he had left behind thirty years ago—not knowing that his living
grandchildren were at this moment on the pontoon bridge across Lake Totenkopf,
fleeing his advance. Corporal Gottfried Kuntz saw his mistress (who in reality
had been raped and then disemboweled by Russian soldiers when Berlin fell in
1945). Oberlieutenant Sigmund Voegel saw a ticket to the Wagner festival at
Bayreuth. Colonel-SS Konrad Schein saw a hundred Jews lined up before a machine
gun that awaited his hand on the trigger. Obergrup-penfuehrer Ernst Bickler saw
a blue china soup tureen standing in an empty fireplace at his grandmother's
house in Kassel. It was brimful of steaming brown dogshit into which was plunged
a silver spoon. General Hanfgeist saw Adolf Hitler, his face blackened, his eyes
and tongue bulging out, his neck broken, spinning at the end of a hangman's
rope.</p>
<p>All of the men who saw the apple, in whatever form, began to fight and kill
one another for possession. Tanks smashed into one another head-on. Artillerymen
lowered the barrels of their guns and fired point-blank into the center of the
melee.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Wolfgang?&quot; said Winifred imploringly, her arms thrown
in panic around his waist.</p>
<p>&quot;Look into the center of the battle,&quot; said Wolfgang grimly.
&quot;What do you see?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see the throne of the world. One single chair twenty-three feet off
the ground, studded with seventeen rubies, and brooding over it the serpent
swallowing its tail, the Rosy Cross, and the Eye. I see that throne and know
that I alone am to ascend it and occupy it forever. What do you see?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see Hagbard Celine's <i>teufelschelss </i>head on a silver
platter,&quot; Wolfgang snarled, thrusting her from him with trembling hands.
&quot;Eris has thrown the Apple of Discord, and our Supernazis will fight and
kill each other until we destroy it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did she go?&quot; asked Werner.</p>
<p>&quot;She's lurking about somewhere in some other form, no doubt,&quot; said
Wolfgang. &quot;As a toadstool or an owl or some such thing, cackling over the
chaos she's caused.&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly Wilhelm stood up, his fingers clawing at empty air. In a frightfully
clumsy fashion, as if he were deaf, dumb, and blind, he clawed and clamored his
way over the side of the Mercedes that had belonged to von Rundstedt. Once out
of the car, he took a position about ten feet away from his brothers and sister,
turned, and faced them. His eyes stared—every muscle in his body was
rigid—the crotch of his trousers bulged.</p>
<p>The voice that came out of his mouth was deep, rich, oleaginous, and horrid:
&quot;There are long accounts to settle, children of Gruad.&quot;</p>
<p>Wolfgang forgot the sounds of battle that raged around him. &quot;You! Here!
How did you escape?&quot;</p>
<p>The voice was like crude petroleum seeping through gravel, and, like
petroleum, it was a fossil thing, the voice of a creature that had arisen on the
planet when the South Pole was in the Sahara and the great cephalopods were the
highest form of life.</p>
<p>&quot;I took no notice. The geometries ceased to bind me. I came forth. I ate
souls. Fresh souls, not the miserable plasma you have fed me all these
years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great Gruad! Is that your gratitude?&quot; Wolfgang stormed. In a lower
voice he said to Werner, &quot;Find the talisman. I think it's in the black case
sealed with the Seal of Solomon and the Eye of Newt.&quot; To the being that
occupied Wilhelm's body he said, &quot;You come at an opportune time. There will
be much killing here, and many souls to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These around us have no souls. They have only pseudo-life. It sickens
me to sense them.&quot;</p>
<p>Wolfgang laughed. &quot;Even the lloigor can feel disgust, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have been sick for many hundreds of years, while you kept me sealed
in one pentagon after another, feeding me not fresh souls but those wretched
stored essences.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We gave you much!&quot; cried Werner. &quot;Every year, just for you,
thirty thousand—forty thousand—fifty thousand deaths in traffic accidents
alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But not fresh: Not fresh! Perhaps, though, you can settle your debt to
me tonight. I sense many lives nearby— Lives you have somehow lured here. They
can be mine.&quot;</p>
<p>Werner handed Wolfgang a stick with a silver pentagon at the tip. Wolfgang
pointed it at the possessed Wilhelm, who shrieked and fell to his knees. For a
moment there was silence, broken only by the sound of Winifred's terrified
sobbing and the crack of rifles and the chatter of machine guns in the
background.</p>
<p>&quot;You shall not have those lives, Yog Sorhoth. They are for the
transcendental illumination of our servants. Wait, though, and there shall be
lives in plenty for all of us.&quot;</p>
<p>Werner said, &quot;While we parley our army is destroying itself, and there
will be no lives for anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; said the thick voice. &quot;How has your plan gone
astray? Let me read you and learn.&quot; Wolfgang felt goose pimples break out
all over his body. He shuddered as coarse, boneless fingers dripping with slime
turned the pages of his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm—I see. <i>She </i>is here, then. My ancient enemy. It would be
good to meet her in battle once again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are your powers equal to hers?&quot; said Wolfgang eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;I yield to none&quot; came the proud reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Ask him why he's always getting trapped in pentagons, then,&quot; said
Werner in a low voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up!&quot; Wolfgang whispered savagely. To the lloigor he said,
&quot;Destroy her golden apple and release my army to move ahead, and I will
withhold the power of this pentagon and give you all the lives you seek.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Done!&quot; said the voice. Wilhelm suddenly threw his head back, mouth
wide open. A choking sound came from his throat. He collapsed on his back,
spread-eagled. A strange, greenish, glowing gas rose from his throat.</p>
<p>Werner jumped from the car and rushed over to Wilhelm. &quot;He's
alive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course he's alive,&quot; said Wolfgang. &quot;The Eater of Souls
simply took possession of his body to communicate with us.&quot;</p>
<p>Winifred screamed, &quot;Look!&quot;</p>
<p>The same phosphorescent gas, a huge cloud of it, now obscured the heart of
the battle. It seemed to take a shape like a spider with an uncountable number
of legs, arms, antennae, and tentacles. Gradually the shape changed, glowing
brighter and brighter. A nearby tower on the festival grounds was as visible in
the reflected light as if it were day. Then the glow faded, and the tower was
silhouetted in</p>
<p>moonlight. A great silence fell over the hills around Lake Totenkopf, broken
only by the glad cries of the last contingent of festivalgoers as they made it
safely to the opposite shore.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no time to lose,&quot; Wolfgang said to Werner and Wilhelm.
&quot;Round up some officers. See if you can find Hanfgeist&quot;</p>
<p>Hanfgeist had disappeared. The highest-ranking officer surviving was
Obergruppenfuehrer Bickler, visions of dog turds sadly fading in a mind that
possessed only a horrid semblance of life. A quick survey showed the four
Illuminati Prirni that the Apple of Discord had cost them half their army.</p>
<p>&quot;Onward!&quot; roared Wolfgang, and, tanks in the van, they smashed
through the festival fence, raced over the hills, troops trotting double-time,
and unhesitatingly charged out onto the bridge. Wolfgang stood in the back seat
of the von Rundstedt Mercedes, his black-gloved hands gripping the back of the
front seat, the wind blowing through his crew cut like a field of wheat.
Suddenly, beside him, Wilhelm screamed.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it now?&quot; yelled Wolfgang over the roar of bis advancing
army.</p>
<p>&quot;The lives we are about to take,&quot; the voice of the lloigor grated.
&quot;They are mine, yes? All mine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to me, you energy vampire. We have other debts to discharge, and
other projects to complete. There are twenty-three of our faithful servants
waiting in the Donau-Hotel to be transcendentally illuminated. They come first.
You'll get yours. Wait your turn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Farewell,&quot; said the lloigor. &quot;I shall see you at the hour of
your death.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&quot;I will never die!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fool!&quot; the voice shrieked with Wilhelm's mouth. Suddenly Wilhelm
stood up, threw open the door of the car, and hurled himself out into the lake.
He struck with a huge splash, then sank like a stone. A greenish glow spread in
the black water where he had gone down. And then there were four.</p>
<p>Hagbard stood atop a hill, watching the tanks roll across the bridge,
followed by the black Mercedes, followed by troop carriers and artillery,
followed by trotting foot soldiers. He knelt beside a detonator and shoved down
the handle.</p>
<p>From end to end the bridge and those upon it disappeared in geysers of white
water. The thunder of the explosions—demolition charges placed by the porpoise
horde under the direction of Howard—re-echoed through the hills around the
lake.</p>
<p>The tanks went under first. As the front end of the command car sank under
water, Werner Saure screamed, &quot;My foot's caught!&quot; He went down with
the car, while Wolfgang and Winifred, their tears mingling with the water of
Lake Totenkopf, splashed about in the water with the few remaining Supernazis.</p>
<p>And then there were three.</p>
<p>Hagbard shouted, &quot;I sank it! I sank the George Washington Bridge!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is anything changed?&quot; said George. &quot;Of course,&quot; said
Hagbard. &quot;We've got them on the run. We'll be able to finish them off in a
few more minutes. Then there'll be no more evil in the world. Everything will be
<i>ginger-peachy.&quot; </i>His tone seemed sarcastic rather than victorious,
George noted apprehensively.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I'll admit,&quot; Fission Chips said reasonably, &quot;that I'm
under the influence of some bloody drug from the Kool-Aid. But this simply
cannot all be hallucination. Very definitely, thirteen people took their clothes
off and started dancing. I quite certainly heard them singing 'Blessed be,
blessed be,' over and over. Then a simply gigantic woman rose up from somewhere
and all the sirens and undines and mermaids went back into the water. If this
was Armageddon, it was not precisely the way the Bible described it Is that a
fair summary of the situation?&quot; The tree he was talking to didn't answer.
&quot;Blessed be, blessed be,&quot; Lady Velkor sang on, as she and her hastily
assembled coven danced widdershins in their circle. The spell had worked: With
her own eyes she had seen the Great Mother, Isis, rise up and smite the evil
spirits of the dead Catholic Inquisitors whom the Illuminati had tried to
revive. She knew Hagbard Celine would later be boasting in all the most chic
occult circles that he had performed the miracle, and giving the credit to that
destructive bitch Eris—but that didn't matter. She with her own eyes had seen
Isis, and that was enough.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I ask you,&quot; Fission Chips went on, addressing another tree,
who seemed more communicative, &quot;what the sulphurous hell did <i>you </i>see
happening here tonight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw a master Magician,&quot; said the tree, &quot;or a master con
man—the two are the same—plant a few suggestions and get a bunch of
acidheads running away from their own shadows.&quot; The tree, who was actually
Joe Malik and only looked like a tree to poor befuddled 00005, added, &quot;Or I
saw the final battle between Good and Evil, with Horus on both sides.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must be drugged too,&quot; Chips said pettishly.</p>
<p>&quot;You bet your sweet ass I am,&quot; said the tree, walking away.</p>
<p>. . . <i>I don't</i> <i>know how the courts will ever untangle this. With
five of them shooting at once, and the Secret Service shooting back right away,
the best crime lab in the world will never get the trajectories of all the
bullets right. Who, among the survivors, will be tried for murder and who for
attempted murder? Thafs the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question and . . . what?
. . . oh . . .And now, ladies and gentlemen, on this sad occasion . </i>. . <i>uh
... in this tragic hour of our country's history, let us all pay especially
close attention to the new President, who will now address us.</i></p>
<p><i>Who's that jig standing over there? </i>the new Chief Exec was asking
somebody off camera when he appeared on the TV screens.</p>
<p>The Chevrolet Stegosaurus drove into the empty concert grounds and came to a
slow halt. The guitarist stuck his head out the window and yelled to Lady
Velkor, &quot;What the hell happened here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was some bad acid in me Kool-Aid,&quot; she told him gravely.
&quot;Everybody freaked out and ran off toward town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hell,&quot; he said, &quot;and this was going to be our first big
audience. We're a new group, just formed. What lousy luck.&quot;</p>
<p>He turned and drove off, and she read the sign on the back of the car: THE
FERNANDO POO INCIDENT.</p>
<p>&quot;How are you now, baby?&quot; Simon asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I know who I am,&quot; Mary Lou said slowly, &quot;and you might not
like the results of that any more than the Chicago police force will.&quot; Her
eyes were distant and pensive.</p>
<p>Wolfgang and Winifred were very near shore when the</p>
<p>dark, humped shapes rose out of the water around them. Winifred shrieked,
&quot;Wolfgang! For the love of Gruad, Wolfgang! They're pulling me down!&quot;
Her long blond hair floated for a moment after her head went under; then that
too disappeared.</p>
<p>And then there were two.</p>
<p>The porpoises have her, Wolfgang thought to himself. He continued to swim
madly toward shore. Something caught his trouser leg, but he kicked free. Then
he was in the shallows, too close in for the sea beasts to follow. He stood up
and waded ashore. And came face to face with John Dillinger.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, pal,&quot; said John, and squeezed the trigger of his Thompson
submachine gun. Thirty silver bullets struck Wolfgang with the impact of clubs
and threw him back into the water. All feeling was gone from his body, and he
felt the foul tentacles closing around his mind and the murmuring, horrible
laughter grew to a soundless roar, and the syrupy voice spoke to his mind: <i>Welcome
to the place prepared for you from everlasting to everlasting. Now truly you
will never die. </i>And the mind of Wolfgang Saure, imprisoned like a living fly
in amber, knowing that it must remain so for billions upon billions of years,
screamed and screamed and screamed.</p>
<p>And then there was one.</p>
<p>And Joe Malik, feeling as if he were sitting in an audience watching himself
perform, walked over to that One and held out his hand.
&quot;Congratulations,&quot; he said icily. &quot;You really did it.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard looked at the hand and said, &quot;You were more intimate the last
time around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Joe. &quot;My Lord, my enemy.&quot; He leaned
forward and kissed Hagbard full on the mouth. Then he took the gun out of his
pocket and carefully fired directly into Hagbard's brain. And then there were
none.</p>
<p>It was quite real; Joe shook himself, stood up, and grinned. Walking over to
Hagbard, he took out the gun and handed it to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Surprise ending,&quot; he said. &quot;I read all the clues, just like
you wanted me to. I know you're the fifth Illuminatus Primus, and I know your
motive for wiping out the other four is nothing like you've led us to believe.
But I can't play my role. I still trust you. You <i>must </i>have a good
reason.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard's mouth fell open in completely genuine surprise. &quot;Well, <i>sink
</i>me!&quot; he said, beginning to laugh.</p>
<p>Dawn was breaking; the Nine Unknown Men, most mysterious of all rock groups,
ceremonially donned their football helmets and faced the East to chant:</p>
<p>There is only ONE God: He is the SUN God: Ra! Ra! Ra!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
