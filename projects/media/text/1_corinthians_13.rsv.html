    <h1>1 Corinthians 13 (English - <acronym title="Revised Standard Version">RSV</acronym>)</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</li>
      <li>And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</li>
      <li>If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</li>
      <li>Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful;</li>
      <li>it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;</li>
      <li>it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right.</li>
      <li>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</li>
      <li>Love never ends; as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.</li>
      <li>For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect;</li>
      <li>but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away.</li>
      <li>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I gave up childish ways.</li>
      <li>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood.</li>
      <li>So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</li>
    </ol>
