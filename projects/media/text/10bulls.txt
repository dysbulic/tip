   Introduction by Paul Reps
   
     The enlightenment for which Zen aims, for which Zen exists, comes
     of itself. As consciousness, one moment it does not exist, the next
     it does. But physical man walks in the element of time even as he
     walks in mud, dragging his feet and his true nature.
     
     So even Zen must compromise and recognize progressive steps of
     awareness leading closer to the ever instant of enlightenment.
     
     That is what this book is about. In the twelfth century the Chinese
     master Kakuan drew the pictures of the ten bulls, basing them on
     earlier Taoist bulls, and wrote the comments in prose and verse
     translated here. His version was pure Zen, going deeper than
     earlier versions, which had ended with the nothingness of the
     eighth picture. It has been a constant source of inspiration to
     students ever since, and many illustrations of Kakuan's bulls have
     been made through the centuries.
     
     The illustrations reproduced here are modern versions by the noted
     Kyoto woodblock artist Tomikichiro Tokuriki, descendant of a long
     line of artists and proprietor of the Daruma-do teashop (Daruma is
     the Japanese name for Bodhidharma, the first Zen patriarch). His
     oxherding pictures are as delightfully direct and timelessly
     meaningful as Kakuan's original must have been.
     
     The following is adapted from the preface by Nyogen Senzaki and
     Paul Reps to the first edition of their translation.
     
     
     The bull is the eternal principle of life, truth in action. the ten
     bulls represent sequent steps in the realization of one's true
     nature.
     
     This sequence is as potent today as it was when Kakuan (1100-1200)
     developed it from earlier works and made his paintings of the bull.
     Here in America we perform a similar work eight centuries later to
     keep the bull invigorated. [There in Kyoto, Tokuriki has done the
     same.]
     
     An understanding of the creative principle transcends any time or
     place. The 10 Bulls is more than poetry, more than pictures. It is
     a revelation of spiritual unfoldment paralleled in every bible of
     human experience. May the reader, like the Chinese patriarch,
     discover the footprints of his potential self and, carrying the
     staff of his purpose and the wine jug of his true desire, frequent
     the market place and there enlighten others.

   Chapter 1. The Search for the Bull
   
	In the pasture of this world, I endlessly push
	       aside the tall grasses in search of the
	       bull.
	Following unnamed rivers, lost upon the in-
	       terpenetrating paths of distant moun-
	       tains,
	My strength failing and my vitality ex-
	       hausted, I cannot find the bull.
	I only hear the locusts chirring through the
	       forest at night.

     
     Comment: The bull never has been lost. What need is there to
     search? Only because of separation from my true nature, I fail to
     find him. In the confusion of the senses I lose even his tracks.
     Far from home, I see many crossroads, but which way is the right
     one I know not. Greed and fear, good and bad, entangle me.

   Chapter 2. Discovering the Footprints 
   
	Along the riverbank under the trees, I dis-
	       cover footprints!
	Even under the fragrant grass I see his prints.
	Deep in remote mountains they are found.
	These traces no more can be hidden than
	       one's nose, looking heavenward.

     
     Comment: Understanding the teaching, I see the footprints of the
     bull. Then I learn that, just as many utensils are made from one
     metal, so too are myriad entities made of the fabric of self.
     Unless I discriminate, how will I perceive the true from the
     untrue? Not yet having entered the gate, nevertheless I have
     discerned the path.

   Chapter 3. Perceiving the Bull 
   
	I hear the song of the nightingale.
	The sun is warm, the wind is mild, willows
	       are green along the shore,
	Here no bull can hide!
	What artist can draw that massive head,
	       those majestic horns?

     
     Comment:When one hears the voice, one can sense its source. As soon
     as the six senses merge, the gate is entered. Wherever one enters
     one sees the head of the bull! this unity is like salt in water,
     like color in dyestuff. The slightest thing is not apart from self.

   Chapter 4. Catching the Bull 
   
	I seize him with a terrific struggle.
	His great will and power are inexhaustible.
	He charges to the high plateau far above the
	       cloud-mists,
	Or in an impenetrable ravine he stands.

     
     Comment: He dwelt in the forest a long time, but I caught him
     today! Infatuation for scenery interferes with his direction.
     Longing for sweeter grass, he wanders away. his mind still is
     stubborn and unbridled. If I wish him to submit, I must raise my
     whip.

   Chapter 5. Taming the Bull 
   
	The whip and rope are necessary,
	Else he might stray off down some dusty
	       road.
	Being well trained, he becomes naturally
	       gentle.
	Then, unfettered, he obeys his master.

     
     Comment: When one thought arises, another thought follows. When the
     first thought springs from enlightenment, all subsequent thoughts
     are true. Through delusion, one makes everything untrue. Delusion
     is not caused by objectivity; it is the result of subjectivity.
     Hold the nose-ring tight and do not allow even a doubt.

   Chapter 6. Riding the Bull Home 
   
	Mounting the bull, slowly I return homeward.
	The voice of my flute intones through the
	       evening.
	Measuring with hand-beats the pulsating
	       harmony, I direct the endless rhythm.
	Whoever hears this melody will join me.

     
     Comment: This struggle is over; gain and loss are assimilated. I
     sing the song of the village woodsman, and play the tunes of the
     children. Astride the bull, I observe the clouds above. Onward I
     go, no matter who may wish to call me back.

   Chapter 7. The Bull Transcended 
   
	Astride the bull, I reach home.
	I am serene. The bull too can rest.
	The dawn has come. In blissful repose,
	Within my thatched dwelling I have aban-
	       doned the whip and rope.

     
     Comment: All is one law, not two. We only make the bull a temporary
     subject. It is as the relation of rabbit and trap, of fish and net.
     It is as gold and dross, or the moon emerging from a cloud. One
     path of clear light travels on throughout endless time.

   Chapter 8. Both Bull and Self Transcended 
   
	Whip, rope, person, and bull-all merge in
	       No-Thing.
	This heaven is so vast no message can stain it.
	How may a snowflake exist in a raging fire?
	Here are the footprints of the patriarchs.

     
     Comment: Mediocrity is gone. Mind is clear of limitation. I seek no
     state of enlightenment. Neither do I remain where no enlightenment
     exists. Since I linger in neither condition, eyes cannot see me. If
     hundreds of birds strew my path with flowers, such praise would be
     meaningless.

   Chapter 9. Reaching the Source 
   
	Too many steps have been taken returning
	       to the root and the source.
	Better to have been blind and deaf from the
	       beginning!
	Dwelling in one's true abode, unconcerned
  	     with that without-
	The river flows tranquilly on and the flowers
	       are red.

     
     Comment:From the beginning, truth is clear. Poised in silence, I
     observe the forms of integration and disintegration. One who is not
     attached to "form" need not be "reformed." The water is emerald,
     the mountain is indigo, and I see that which is creating and that
     which is destroying.

   Chapter 10. In the World 
   
	Barefooted and naked of breast, I mingle
	       with the people of the world.
	My cloths are ragged and dust-laden, and I
	       am ever blissful.
	I use no magic to extend my life;
	Now, before me, the dead trees become
	       alive.

     
     Comment: Inside my gate, a thousand sages do not know me. The
     beauty of my garden is invisible. Why should one search for the
     footprints of the patriarchs? I go to the market place with my wine
     bottle and return home with my staff. I visit the wineshop and the
     market, and everyone I look upon becomes enlightened.
