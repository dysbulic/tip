Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses 
pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the
fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses
raised his club, the waters parted and it rolled to the other side
safe and sound.

Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee, hit a nice long one directly 
toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the center of the
pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out
on the pond, and chipped the ball onto the green.

The third guy got up and sort of randomly whacked the ball. It 
headed out over the fence, into oncoming traffic on a nearby street,
bounced off a truck, hit a tree, bounced onto the golf course onto
the roof of a building and rolled down into the gutter, down the rain
spout, out on the fairway and straight toward the water hazard. On
the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone, bounced out over the water
onto a lily pad. Suddenly, a huge bull frog snatched the ball into
his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and
flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with
fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a
hole in one.

Moses turned to Jesus and said, "I hate playing with your Dad"!!!!
