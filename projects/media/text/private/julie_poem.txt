"I'm scared,
 so afraid to show I care.
 Will he think me weak
 if I tremble whe I speak?
 What if
 there's another one he's thinking of?
 I'd feel like a fool.
 Love can be so cruel.
 I don't know what to do.

 I've been there,
 with my heart out in my hand.
 But what you must understand
 is you can't let the chance
 to love him pass you by.

 Tell him.
 Tell him that the sun and moon
 rise in his eyes.
 Reach out to him.
 And whisper
 tender words so soft and sweet.
 Hold him close to feel his heartbeat.
 Love will be the gift you give yourself.

 Touch him,
 with the gentleness you feel inside.
 Your love can't be denied
 the truth will set you free
 You'll have whats ment to be.


 I love him,
 then show him.
 Of that much I can be sure
 hold him close to you.
 I don't know if I could endure
 if I let him walk away
 when I have so much to say.

 Tell him
 Tell him that the sun and moon
 rise in his eyes.
 Reach out to him.
 And whisper
 tender words so soft and sweet.
 Hold him close to feel his heartbeat.
 Love will be the gift you give yourself.

 Touch him,
 with the gentleness you feel inside.
 Your love can't be denied
 the truth will set you free
 You'll have whats ment to be.


 I love him,

 Never let him go..."
