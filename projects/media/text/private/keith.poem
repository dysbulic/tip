Pray to the Father when you are uncertain
About the way that you should go.
But remember to listen for He will answer.
Be calm and He will let you know.

Just speak once and He will hear.
Don't let anxiety get in the way
Of the time you spend with Him
To praise and study and pray.

God is faithful, wise, and just.
And when He answers, you will know
He was guiding you along
The path which you should go.


                 --Keith Anderson
