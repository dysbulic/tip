	Mental Touchstones for the Awakening Spirit

		K. Bradford Brown



Introduction:

	_Mental touchstones for the Awakening Mind_
	Many traditions refer to a 'sleep' which grips our lives. Recently
Charles Tart described it in psychological terms as a kind of trance state: we
are literally hypnotised by a world of unconscious expectations and beliefs,
which blinds us to the nature of who, and what, we truly are.
	It is a state which seems indistinguishable from the world around us.
Yet the source of the entrancement lies not in the world, but in our own minds.
It is from the mind itself that we must awaken.
	The short pieces in this book present both a description of this
process of awakening, and a series of surprises for the mind of the reader.
Drawn by the simplicity and frankness of the language, you find yourself being
confronted by paradoxical, contradictory questions, which require a new
attention to the terms of your own thinking.
	It was this challenging quality which struck me when I first saw these
pieces in manuscript form. There seemed to be no way to read them without also
glimpsing the awakening of which they speak.
	In this, they stand at the heart of the work to which the author has
dedicated his life. They are a powerful extension of the experiences I have
come to associate with him, both as a friend and a teacher.
	To quote from one reader: 'These short pieces are really fighting the
inertia, or enervation, of the will. They are thunder, and lightning too:
enlightening, preeminently.' -- Patrick Reyntiens, OBE.

		I am indebted to the following mentors

		When you fear your own negativity
		as much as you fear that of others,
	     you have made a giant step toward awakening.
			--Richard Willis


		Your Life is its intention.
		Life *as it is* is its intention.

				AWAKENING


				3

			My nine year old feet
			    destroyed
				the ant-hill.

			Something in me
			    objected.
			I haven't been
			    the same
				since.

			      *****

				4

			There
			  is
			    no
			      event
			    in
			      your
			          Life
			through which
			     God is not
				    trying to
					communicate
				    with you...
			      to wake up.

			      *****
                                
				5

			Everyone
			   is on a journey
				to somewhere.

			The question
				is where.

			      *****

				6

			Sooner or later
			   you will be required
			       to determine whose
				   reality you are
					living, 
			   and whose reality
				you will live.

			      *****

				7

			You've
			   got to get
				you are
				    in it
				and
				    own it
				before
				    you can
				      get out
					   of it.

			      *****

				8

			You don't have to do a lot.

			You just have to be willing.

			The rest falls into place...
			    unless
				it doesn't.

			Then you continue to be willing.

			      *****

				9

			Life
			  begins
			      not at
				 birth,

			      but
			  with the
			      onslaught
				  of
				     awareness.

			      ******

				10

			I am.
			   I am not my thoughts.
				I have thoughts.

			I am.
			   I have a mind.
				I am not my mind.

			I am.
			   My mind thinks.
				I think my mind.

			I am...
			   getting closer.

			      ******

				11

			I am
			     fine
				  when
				       I
					 am.

			      ******

				12

			It is not true
			   there are no 
				guarantees in life.

			Keep thinking
			   you are worthless,
				and you
				      will
					 be.

			      ******

				13

			I observed:
			    this man
				is his
				    own
				      star!

			      ******
	
				14

			The day came
			   when it was more 
				painful
			   for the bud
				to stay closed
			   than to open.

			      ******

				15

			When the pain
			  of our living
			      becomes too great
				  to bear,
			  maybe
			      we will be ready
				     to examine
			      the death of our dying.

			      ******

				16

			It is not
			   that most
			       of us
			   don't know
			       what
			   life
				is
				   all
					about.

			We don't
				even
				  suspect.

			      ******

				17

			We
			   live
				on
				   the
				       stage
					     of
						Life.

                       Most
			   of
			     us
				have
				     made
					  the play
				     a melodrama.

			      ******

				18

			We can
			  only paint
				our pictures
					of life
				with
				    colours
				we have stirred
					from
					     within.

			      ******

				19

			Transformation
			     is necessarily
				unbelievably
					believable.

			      ******

				20

			Lord,
			  Deliver me
				from the plastic
				    Jesus,
				the stone
				    Buddhas
			  and the pious voices.

			Open me
			  to my neighbor's
				touch
			  and the sounds of
				Life...
				      in
					all
					    its
						forms.

			      ******

				21

			Life
			  is like
				my breath.

			It flows
			  through me
				when I open
					to it.

			      ******

				22

			Standing,
			  looking
			      at the 
				  open sea
			      and 
				  seeing it;

			  this is worth
			          waiting
				        for.

			      ******

				23

			Love is     
			   the way in 
				the way out
				     and
				the way through.

				CLEARING

				27
                        You are not
			  who you think you are.

			Neither are you
			  who you are afraid
				you might be.

			So, take heart.

			      ******

				28

			Because I think
			  a thought
			      doesn't
				make it true.

			Most thoughts
			  are
			      profoundly
				false.

			      ******

				29

			When you
			  have dealt
			     with your own
				   negativity
			  you have
			     made the first
			  great step
			     in self-fulfillment.

			      ******

				30

			Outward
			  circumstances
				neither
				   make
					nor
				   break
					us,
				unless
				   inwardly,
					we have
					   identified
					with
			  		   them.
                                                        
			      ******                                
				31

			No
			  one
			     is
				to
				   blame,
			  but
			     we
				all
				   share
					the
					   fault.

			      ******

				32

			I never feel
			   "like" anything.

			I feel
			   angry
			   warm
			   loving
			   lonesome
			   excited
			   aroused
			   hurt
			   hopeful
			   peaceful
			   resentful
			   irritated
			   energised
			   elated
				to mention a few...
						feelings.

			      ******

				33

			The more you choose to experience
			   a negative feeling
				it dissipates.

			The more you choose to experience
			   a positive feeling
				it expands.

			      ******

				34

			For every choice
				that is made
			   others may not.

			That's it.

			      ******

				35

			You must make
				judgements,

			but you don't
			   have to be
				judgemental.

			      ******

				36

			For heaven's sake,
			   stop making "it" wrong.
			   Stop making others wrong.
			   Stop making yourself wrong.

			After all,
			   you were never invited
				to preside as judge
				   of the 
					earth...
						or
						  the
						     heavens.

			On the other hand,
			   what will you
				do with yourself
				   when you're
					out of a
					   job?

			      ******

				37

			When it comes
			   to the quality
				of our Life,
			   we often reason:
				at least bad breath
				   is better
					than
					   none.

			      ******

				38

			When
			   will I get it?

			My negativity
			   is mine.
			Your negativity
			   is yours.

			Hell
			   awaits me
				when I
				   mix it up.

			      ******

				39

			Not
			  one
			     step
				in
				  our
				     growth
					   is
					     made
						alone.

			      ******
				40

			The Awakening process:

			I found it
			   I lost it
				I found it
					again,
			   then
				repeat.

			      ******
				41

			A choice
		 	   for this
				means
			   no choice
				for that.

			Living with it
			   is called
				maturity.
			      ******

				42
                             
                         A clear mind
			   isn't the
				end
				   of it,
			   but
			      it sure
				beats whatever
					is second
			   as a
			      means
				  of
				    getting
                                         you
                                            there.

			      ******

				43

			You can't remain alone
			    with guilt.

			It's married to
				resentment.

			      ******

				44

			It may be true
			   there are many paths
				toward the goal
				    of awakening.

			The straightest
			   path possible
				will get you there
					sooner.

			      ******

				45

			If we'd
			   complete what
				we start
			   we'd find
			     ourselves
				more often
			     starting
				what we complete.

			      ******

				46


			The God our minds invented
			   is an errand boy
				to remove the burdens
					from our hands,
			   a magician
				to eliminate the dross
				    from our daily tasks,
			   a wonder worker
				to transform our crosses
					into jewellery.

			The God we got
			   demands us to accept
				the truth
					about our fantasies.

			      ******

				47

			You may be
			   in a spiritual logjam.
			Not to worry.

			God will either
				build a dam
			   or
				send a flood.

				RESPONDING


				51

			Life is a
			   dance
			      and you'll
				   always
					have
				   partners.

			As in any
			    dance
				the best steps
				    are not
					calculated.

			      ******

				52

			If you get angry
				      a lot
			   you probably hurt
				      a lot.

			Try crying
			   next time.

			      ******

				53

			When
			   we are
				with it
					as
				    we have it,
			   the struggle
					stops.

			      ******

				54

			Handle first your closets,
			   drawers and checkbooks.

			The rest is coming
			      from
				  just around
					the corner.

			      ******

				55

			It isn't so much
			   what you do,
				nor when or where
				   you do it,
			   that makes the difference...

			It's the why.

			      ******

				56

			I've noticed
			   my aliveness
				depends on
				   my willingness

			   to
			      be
				alive.

			      ******

				57

			We often
			   wade ankle deep
				in the
				    issues of Life,
			   crying out
				to everyone
				    who will hear,

			   "we're drowning."

			      ******

				58

			One of the greatest
			   victories in the world
				is to live
				    courageously
			   with the apparent 
				    defeat
				of our wants
				    or ideals.

			      ******

				59

			When life dealt
			   me another
				bad hand,

				did it?

			      ******

				60

			The bigger game
			        you play in life
			   the more opportunities
				for
				   failure
					and
					   frustration...

			   also
				more
				    opportunity.

			      ******

				61

			Loving
			   is
			     its
				own
				   reward.

			You
			   can't
				love
				   without
					feeling
					     Love-d.

			      ******

				62

			If you don't succeed
				the first time
					try, try again,

			   then, for God's sake,
				stop trying
					and notice.

			      ******

				63

			Noticing isn't
				everything,
			   but without it
				there is
				    nothing.

			      ******

				64

			Forgiveness
				is not
				    an emotion,

			   but
				the act of
					dying
				to
				  my
				    self-righteousness.

			      ******

				65

			When I
			   love
				honour
				   and
				     respect
					you
				from the start
			   there is no limit
				on what
				   we can do
					or be
					    together.

			      ******

				66

			The throat
			   is the pathway
				between the
				    mind and
					the heart,
			   the gate across
				    the moat.

			Open it
			   to the king's trumpet
				now.

			      ******

				67

			The
			   language
				 God
				  speaks
				     is
			   the language
				     of
					life.

			You don't need
			   a translator,
				but
				   good ears.

			      ******

				68

			When I learn
			   to embrace
				the God
			   of the dark
			      as
				well
				    as
				      the
					 light,
			I shall
			   see forever.

			      ******

				69

			Remember,
			   one
			     candle
				lights
				     a
				      whole
					 room.

				73

			My greatest blindness
			   is failing to see
				I created you

			It's easier

				way around.

			      ******

			Source of

				OBSERVING


				101

			More changes in our lives
			   happen
			      in spite of us
			   than
			      because of us.

			Life
			   is

                                  living.
			and
                           not about

			Peace is
			   not the absence 
				of conflict

			   but
			      the presence
				   of God.

			In that presence
			   respect,
			      honour,
				and love
			   reign as peace.

			      *******

				104

			Hope
			   may be
				the slenderest
				   of needs
			   upon which
			      we may base
				 our future.

			But for many humans
			   slender needs
			      represent
				 a quantum jump
			   in their resources.

			      *******

				105

			You ask,
			   how do I know
				that
				   life is perfect?

			Because
			   it is
				exactly
				   as it is.

			The mind
			   insists
				on something
				   else.

			      *******

				106

			The undiscerning mind
			   is like a tree.

			It receives everything
			   that falls on it.

			      *******

				107

			The Scriptures
			   are about Life--
				yours,
                                    ours,
                                        mine,
                                           and
                                              His,
			   a mirror on the nature
			      and the quality
				 of our personal
					and corporate
					  evolution,
			   not an outline
			       of do's and don'ts.

			We threw those out
			   with mom and dad,
				unless
				    we didn't.

			      *******

				108

			What am I
			   to learn
				from all of
				    this?

			There is a
			   beginning
				a middle
				   and an end.

			You'll never
			   be quite sure
				which is
				   which.

			And
                           it's
                               just

			Love
			   isn't
                                reasonable.

			It
                          seldom
                               looks

				111

			It may be
			   that our misery
			        is self-inflicted,

			   but the friendly reminders

				   righteous truthtellers
			   do little

			      *******

				112

			Some wounds
			   can't be healed
				by a doctor.

			We must
			   lick them clean
				in a quiet place
			   and wait
				for the earth to turn.

			      *******

				113

			The game
			   is to

			The mills of God
			   grind slowly

			Is that why

			Better get this:

			   There are

				or women,

                               people
                                   like

			Life is going

			You have to reach for it,

			   to get the prize.

			The rest of the people

			The search

			If I am the effect of you

			Agreement with others

				132

			Life meets us
			   coming and going.

			Unfortunately,

				coming
			   when it is going
				and,
			   going when it is
				coming.

			We can do
