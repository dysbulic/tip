Subj:	What does this mean?  What is it about?

My life is here, but does not exist.
My soul is wrenching, but cannot feel.
My heart is bleeding, yet will not clot.
There is a piece missing, But I don't know.

My eyes are open, but I can not see.
My eyes are clear, I can not hear it.
My world is caving, I can not hide.
There is a piece missing, is it you?

My wounds are open, they will not heal.
My life is something, but is it true?
My truth is feigning, yet boldly seen.
There is no piece, it is you.

My world is cracking, belief is broken in two,
can you join me; can we begin anew? 
The world is Gray and fading swift, 
I'm losing touch and sight in one.






I'm lost






In you?

In all of our searching, all that we have found to make the emptiness
bearable is each other.
