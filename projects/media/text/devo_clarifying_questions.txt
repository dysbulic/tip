I once went to a lecture on ethics by a Harvard Business School
Professor called Joseph Badarocco.  He said "there is no ethics engine
where you crank the handle and the "right" answer comes out."  He went
on to say that we all just struggle with the issues - in the best
sense of that word struggle - and then we make the "best" choice we
can.  He offered four questions (tools) to assist the struggle.

* John Stuart Mill's Question - The Utilitarian Question

How much good and how much harm is going to come from the action
contemplated?

* Thomas Jefferson's Question - The  Question of Inalienable Rights

What things can you simply not do to another person, no much how much
good may come out of these actions?

* Aristotle's Question - The Personal Question

What sort of person do I want to be?

* Machiavelli's Question - The Pragmatist's Question

What will work in the world as it is (with the boldness and
imagination of leadership)?
