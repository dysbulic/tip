"He went to Paris
 Lookin' for answers
 To questions that bothered him so
 He was impressive,
 Young and agressive,
 Savin' the world on his own

 The warm summer breezes,
 The French wines and cheeses
 Put his ambition at bay
 The summers and winters
 Scattered like splinters
 And four or five years slipped away

 And he went to England
 Played the piano
 And married an actress named Kim
 They had a fine life,
 She was a good wife,
 And bore him a young son named Jim

 And all of the answers
 And all of the questions
 Locked in his attic one day
 'Cause he liked the quiet,
 Clean country livin',
 And twenty more years slipped away.

 Well, the war took his baby
 The bombs took his lady
 And left him with only one eye
 His body was battered
 His whole world was shattered
 And all he could do was just cry

 While the tears were a-fallin'
 He was recallin'
 Answers he never found
 So he hopped on a freighter
 Skidded the ocean
 And left England without a sound

 Now he lives in the islands,
 Fishes the pilin's
 And drinks his Green Label each day
 Writing his memoirs
 Losing his hearing
 But he don't care what most people say

 Through eighty-six years
 Of perpetual motion,
 If he likes you, he'll smile and he'll say,
 "Jimmy, some of it's magic,
  Some of it's tragic,
  But I had a good life all the way."

 He went to Paris,
 Lookin' for answers
 To questions that bothered him so."
			-Jimmy Buffet
