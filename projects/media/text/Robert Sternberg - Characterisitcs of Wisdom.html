          <li>
            The loss of wisdom &mdash; John A. Meacham
            <ol>
              <li>knowing that one does not know because there is no limit to what can be known</li>
              <li>knowledge is fallible belief &mdash; strives to construct new uncertainties, doubts, and questions of what might be known</li>
              <li>adding to knowledge one hold while at same time recognizing there is much one doesn't know</li>
              <li>attitude taken by persons toward beliefs, values, knowledge, information, abilities, &amp; skills that are held, a tendency to doubt that these are necessarily true or valid and to doubt that they are an exhaustive set of those things that could  be known</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>

              <li>a comprehensive grasp of knowledge characterized by both breadth and depth</li>
              <li>a recognition that knowledge is uncertain and that it is not possible for truth to be absolutely knowable at any given time</li>
              <li>a willingness and exceptional ability to formulate sound, executable judgments in the face of this uncertainty</li>
              <li>intellectual ability allowing few individuals to make particularly exceptional judgments about uncertain problematic life issues</li>
              <li>more than logic &amp; is generally uncalled for in well-structured problems</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Wisdom: The Art of Problem Finding &mdash; Patricia Kennedy Arlin
            <ol>

              <li>The Search for Complementarity: "Problem finding is essentially the establishment of the need for a new and highly complex mental program." (Finding similarities between things previously isolated.)</li>
              <li>The Detection of Asymmetry: Ability to detect a lack of balance "where the casual observer notes no differences or finds a conventional explanation to be satisfactory. Genius is not a requirement for wisdom. Wisdom involves a sensitivity to both symmetry and asymmetry. Wisdom is present in the noticing of subtle features that make a difference in problem solving definitions and ultimately in problem solving."</li>
              <li>Openness to Change: "Wisdom has as one of its requirements the willingness to remain open to receive new information and on the basis of that information to be willing to change one's worldview. Perhaps wisdom arises from the opportunity to experience changes in our own beliefs and assumptions- changes that help us realize that the ideas and priorities that seem so clear today will probably be modified as a function of new experiences.</li>
              <li>Pushing the Limits: "Wisdom is not attributed to judgements or solutions because of their close conformity to an acknowledged standard of right or wrong. Wise decisions, solutions, and judgements are often acknowledged as wise because they push these standards to their limits or create types of metastandards that redefine the acceptable."</li>
              <li>Importance: a sense of taste for problems that are of fundamental importance</li>
              <li>Conceptual Preferences: the preference for certain conceptual moves (see p 237 in the 1990&copy; for a long list of wisdom characteristics)</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

            <ol>
              <li>ultimate possible achievement of a normal person's growth</li>
              <li>category describing moment in development in development when psychological system fully coordinates across experiential contexts &amp; alternatives forms/modes of processing</li>
              <li>anchored in present, has dialectically integrated into a manifold totality the multiple aspects of his/her self-experience &amp; has done so not just conceptually but experientially, historically, &amp; culturally</li>
              <li>appears when dialectical integration reaches sufficient breadth &amp; cohesion over person's control processes &amp; over his/her storehouse of informational processes (cognitive, affective, inter/intrapersonal, religious, existential,cultural, etc.)</li>
              <li>ability to resolve dialectical contradictions that emerge in certain contexts, to apply these resolutions to different life contexts in order to build a more autonomous self</li>
              <li>appears with emergence of progressively higher levels of affect/self-control which with advancement brings about a better dialectical integration of personality</li>
              <li>a weakening of ego centered characteristics, leading to a greater intuition &amp; empathic understanding of others, self, world, and nature as equally strong concerns</li>

              <li>integration of thoughts and feelings (interdependent cognition and affect)</li>
