A farmer wanted to have his hens serviced, so he went to the market
looking for a rooster.

He was hoping he could get a special rooster-one that could service
all his many hens and when he told this to the market vendor, the
vendor replied: I have just the rooster for you. Randy here is the
horniest rooster you will ever see!

So the farmer took Randy back to the farm.
 
Before setting him loose in the hen house though, he gave Randy a
little pep talk.

"Randy", he said, "I'm counting on you to do your stuff".

And without a word (since Randy was not a talking rooster after all),
he strutted into the hen house.

Randy was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a
thunderbolt.

There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Randy had
finished having his way with each hen.

But Randy didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all
the horses, one by one.

Then he went to the pig house, where he did the same.

The farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out "Stop,
Randy, you'll kill yourself".

But Randy continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.
 
Well the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Randy lying there
on his lawn.

His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue
hanging out.

A buzzard was already circling above Randy.

The farmer walked up to Randy saying "Oh you poor thing, look what you
did, you've gone and killed yourself.

I warned you my little buddy".

"Shhhhh," Randy whispered, "The buzzard's getting closer."
