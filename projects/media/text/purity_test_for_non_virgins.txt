The 100 point purity test for non-virgins

version 1.2 by omni@circus.com - copy and distribute freely 

This test rates your sexual purity. The majority of these 100
questions assume that you have had sex at some point in your life, so
you won't have to wade through lots of questions asking if you've ever
been on a date, stroked someone's thigh, etc. For the purposes of this
test, "sex" is defined as one or more of the following: intercourse,
oral sex, or anal sex. Digital sex doesn't count - you have to draw
the line somewhere. 

Check all boxes for which your answer is "yes"
