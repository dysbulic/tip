 King Arthur was getting ready to go on a Quest.   He was worried about
 leaving Queen Guinevere alone with all those horny knights of the Round
 Table. So he went to Merlin for some advice. After explaining his
 predicament to Merlin, the wizard looked thoughtful and said to come back
 in a week and he'd see if he could come up with something.
 
 A week later King Arthur was back in Merlin's laboratory where the good
 wizard was showing him his latest invention.  It was a chastity
 belt...except it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place.  "This
 is no good, Merlin!" the king exclaimed, "Look at this opening.  How is
 this supposed to protect m'lady, the Queen?"
 
 "Ah, sire, just observe."  said Merlin as he searched his cluttered
 workbench until he found what he was looking for.  He then selected his
 most worn out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway.  He then
 inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small
 guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two.
 
  "Merlin, you are a genius!" said the greatful monarch, "Now I can leave,
 knowing that my Queen is fully protected."
 
 After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his
 Quest.  Several years passed until he returned to Camelot. Immediately he
 assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers
 for an informal 'short arm' inspection. Sure enough!
 
 Each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way. All
 of them except Sir Galahad.
 
 "Sir Galahad", exclaimed King Arthur, "The one and only true knight! Only
 you among all the nobles have been true to me.  What is it in my power to
 grant you?  Name it and it is yours!"
 
 But Sir Galahad was speechless.
