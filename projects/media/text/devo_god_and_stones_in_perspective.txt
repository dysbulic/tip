			A Thought on Perspective


Take a large block of marble.  What is it?


The gardiner sees an obstacle in the way of his lawnmower.

The road contractor sees potential gravel.

Michelangelo sees a statue of David.

And the blind man sees nothing.


Take God.  What is it?


The Calvinist sees a stern judge.

The Physicist sees a cosmic force.

St. John sees Love.

And the blind man sees nothing.
