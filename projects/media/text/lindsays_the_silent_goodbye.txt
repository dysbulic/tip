     The Silent Good-bye

He comes once more
	for the last time
Like a stranger in the night
	to the place he knew so well

He says a thousand words
	and never speaks
His eyes speak his heart's mind
	and force me to listen

I blink and he is gone
	as quickly as he had arrived
I know not where he went
	or how
But know just the same it was
	the last time I should see him

And out of the house I step
	disbelievingly letting the glass door shut
The motion creates nostalgic winds
	and as I smell his cologne
	I feel him

No more shall his laughter come to my mind
Or my lips desire his
As I stand in the place 
	we held each other for hours
I appreciate his gift--
	the silent good-bye
