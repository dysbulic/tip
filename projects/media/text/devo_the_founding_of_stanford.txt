This is a cool story that was sent to me by Liv Cole, a freshman in my honors
101 class. Some of you have already received it, but i thought i'd send it out
to everybody.

Think about it...

A lady in a faded gingham dress and her husband, dressed in a homespun
threadbare suit, stepped off the train in Boston, and walked timidly
without an appointment into the outer office of the President of 
Harvard
University.

The secretary could tell in a moment that such backwoods, country 
hicks had
no business at Harvard and probably didn't even deserve to be in 
Cambridge.
 She frowned. 
"We want to see the president," the man said softly. "He'll be busy 
all day," the secretary snapped. "We'll wait," the lady replied.
For hours, the secretary ignored them, hoping that the couple would 
finally become discouraged and go away. They didn't.   
And the secretary grew frustrated and finally decided to disturb the
president, even though it was a chore she always regretted to do. 
"Maybe if they just see you for a few minutes, they'll leave," she told him. And 
he sighed in  exasperation and nodded.
Someone of his importance obviously didn't have the time to spend with
them, but he detested gingham dresses and homespun suits cluttering up 
his outer office. The president, stern-faced with dignity, strutted toward 
the couple.
The lady told him, "We had a son that attended Harvard for one year. 
He loved Harvard. He was happy here. But about a year ago, he was 
accidentally killed. And my husband and I would like to erect a memorial to him,
somewhere on campus." 

The president wasn't touched; he was shocked.   "Madam," he said 
gruffly, "We can't put up a statue for every person who attended Harvard and 
died.  If we did, this place 
would look like a cemetery."
"Oh, no," the lady explained quickly, "We don't want to erect a statue. We
thought we would like to give a building to Harvard.  
The president rolled his eyes. He glanced at the gingham dress and homespun
suit, then exclaimed, "A building!  Do you have any earthly idea how 
much a building costs? We have over seven and a half million dollars in the
physical plant at 
Harvard." For a moment the lady was silent. The president was pleased. 
He could get rid of them now.
And the lady turned to her husband and said quietly, "Is that all it 
costs to start a University? Why don't we just start our own?" 
Her husband nodded. 
The president's face wilted in confusion and bewilderment.
And Mr. and Mrs. Leland Stanford walked away, traveling to Palo Alto,
California, where they established the University that bears their 
name, a memorial to a son that Harvard no longer cared about.

Sometimes first impressions are wrong. Someone might look like a chunk 
of gold, and quickly rust. Or we might turn away someone with drive, 
loyalty, ambition, determination, etc.  
We hear that what goes around, comes around. Just in case that might
actually be true and in case you have ever felt under appreciated, 
then you might consider taking advantage of the next opportunity to look a 
little deeper for the goodness in others.

hope you liked it,
