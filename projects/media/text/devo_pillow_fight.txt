 You've just been hit by a giant pillow. 
 Get in the fun and hit everyone you know.
 
 It's the start of......
 PILLOW FIGHT 
 '98!!!!
 
No messy marshmallows, or parachuting cows, or totem poles, or kisses,
or hugs. Just soft, painless (sometimes) pillows.
 
 There are only three rules:
 1. No napping using the pillow fight pillows.
 2. You can't hit someone who has already hit you.
 3. There are no more rules.
 
Now.....go out there and hit as many people as you can before they get
you!!!!!!
 
 And remember:
 HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS YOU CAN !!!!!
