Nasruddin Hoja used to stand on the street on market-days.  People would
offer him a choice between a large and a small coin, and Nasruddin would
always take the smaller coin, and the people would laugh and make fun of
him thinking what an idiot he was.  They never tired of doing this, 
always thinking he must be very stupid to always take the smaller coin.

One day, a kind gentleman said to Nasrudin, "You know, you should take
the larger coin.  That way, you will have more money, and people will
stop making fun of you."

Nasrudin replied, "That may be true.  But if I always take the larger
coin, people will stop offering coins to me to prove that I am more
idiotic than them.  Then I would have no money at all!"
