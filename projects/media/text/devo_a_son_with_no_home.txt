   A story is told about a soldier who was finally coming
   home after having fought in Vietnam.  He called his
   parents from San Francisco.  "Mom and Dad, I'm coming
   home, but I've a favor to ask.  I have a friend I'd like
   to bring home with me.  "Sure," they replied, "we'd love
   to meet him."

   "There's something you should know the son continued,
   "he was hurt pretty badly in the fighting.  He stepped on
   a land mind and lost an arm and a leg.  He has nowhere
   else to go, and I want him to come live with us."

   "I'm sorry to hear that, son.  Maybe we can help him find
   somewhere to live."  "No, Mom and Dad, I want him to
   live with us."  "Son," said the father, "you don't know
   what you're asking.  Someone with such a handicap
   would be a terrible burden on us.  We have our own lives
   to live, and we can't let something like this interfere with
   our lives.  I think you should just come home and forget
   about this guy.  He'll find a way to live on his own."

   At that point, the son hung up the phone.  The parents
   heard nothing more from him.  A few days later, however,
   they received a call from the San Francisco police.  Their
   son had died after falling from a building, they were told.
   The police believed it was suicide.  The grief-stricken
   parents flew to San Francisco and were taken to the city
   morgue to identify the body of their son.  They recognized
   him, but to their horror they also discovered something
   they didn't know, their son had only one arm and one leg.
