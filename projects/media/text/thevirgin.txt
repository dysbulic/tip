It's your fist time.  As you lie back your muscles tighten.  You
put him off for awhile searching for an excuse, but he refuses to be
swayed as he approaches you.  He asks if you're afraid and you shake
your head bravely. He has had more experience, but it's the first time
his finger has found the right place.  He probes deeply and you shiver;
your body tenses; but he's gentle like he promised he'd be.  He looks
deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him-- he's done this many
times before.  His cool smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him
more room for an easy entrance.  You begin to plead and beg him to hurry,
but he slowly takes his time, wanting to cause you as little pain as
possible. 
As he presses closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue give way; pain
surges throughout your body and you feel the slight trickle of blood as
he continues.  He looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too
painful. 
Your eyes are filled with tears but you shake you head and nod for him
to go on.  He begins moving in and out with skill but you are now too
numb to feel him within you.  After a few frenzied moments, you feel
something bursting within you and he pulls it out of you, you lay panting,
glad to have it over.  He looks at you and smiling warmly, tells you, with
a chuckle; that you have been his most stubborn yet most rewarding
experience.  You smile and thank your dentist.  After all, it was your
first time to have a tooth pulled.
