    <h1>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</h1>
    <h2>by Ursula K. Le Guin</h2>

    <p>With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the
     Festival of Summer came to the city Omelas, bright-towered by the
     sea. The rigging of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags. In
     the streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls,
     between old moss-grown gardens and under avenues of trees, past
     great parks and public buildings, processions moved. Some were
     decorous: old people in long stiff robes of mauve and grey, grave
     master workmen, quiet, merry women carrying their babies and
     chatting as they walked. In other streets the music beat faster,
     a shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing,
     the procession was a dance. Children dodged in and out, their
     high calls rising like the swallows' crossing flights over the
     music and the singing. All the processions wound towards the
     north side of the city, where on the great water-meadow called
     the Green Fields boys and girls, naked in the bright air, with
     mud-stained feet and ankles and long, lithe arms, exercised their
     restive horses before the race. The horses wore no gear at all
     but a halter without bit. Their manes were braided with streamers
     of silver, gold, and green. They flared their nostrils and
     pranced and boasted to one another; they were vastly excited, the
     horse being the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as his
     own. Far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half
     encircling Omelas on her bay. The air of morning was so clear
     that the snow still crowning the Eighteen Peaks burned with
     white-gold fire across the miles of sunlit air, under the dark
     blue of the sky. There was just enough wind to make the banners
     that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then. In the
     silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music
     winding through the city streets, farther and nearer and ever
     approaching, a cheerful faint sweetness of the air that from time
     to time trembled and gathered together and broke out into the
     great joyous clanging of the bells.</p>

    <p>Joyous! How is one to tell about joy? How describe the citizens
     of Omelas?</p>

    <p>They were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy. But
     we do not say the words of cheer much any more. All smiles have
     become archaic. Given a description such as this one tends to
     make certain assumptions. Given a description such as this one
     tends to look next for the King, mounted on a splendid stallion
     and surrounded by his noble knights, or perhaps in a golden
     litter borne by great-muscled slaves. But there was no king. They
     did not use swords, or keep slaves. They were not barbarians. I
     do not know the rules and laws of their society, but I suspect
     that they were singularly few. As they did without monarchy and
     slavery, so they also got on without the stock exchange, the
     advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb. Yet I repeat that
     these were not simple folk, not dulcet shepherds, noble savages,
     bland utopians. They were not less complex than us. The trouble
     is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and
     sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather
     stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is
     the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of
     evil and the terrible boredom of pain. If you can't lick
     'em, join 'em. If it hurts, repeat it. But to praise
     despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose
     hold of everything else. We have almost lost hold; we can no
     longer describe a happy man, nor make any celebration of joy. How
     can I tell you about the people of Omelas? They were not naive
     and happy children - though their children were, in fact, happy.
     They were mature, intelligent, passionate adults whose lives were
     not wretched. O miracle! but I wish I could describe it better. I
     wish I could convince you. Omelas sounds in my words like a city
     in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. Perhaps
     it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids,
     assuming it will rise to the occasion, for certainly I cannot
     suit you all. For instance, how about technology? I think that
     there would be no cars or helicopters in and above the streets;
     this follows from the fact that the people of Omelas are happy
     people. Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is
     necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is
     destructive. In the middle category, however - that of the
     unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury,
     exuberance, etc. - they could perfectly well have central
     heating, subway trains, washing machines, and all kinds of
     marvelous devices not yet invented here, floating light-sources,
     fuelless power, a cure for the common cold. Or they could have
     none of that; it doesn't matter. As you like it. I incline to
     think that people from towns up and down the coast have been
     coming in to Omelas during the last days before the Festival on
     very fast little trains and double-decked trams, and that the
     train station of Omelas is actually the handsomest building in
     town, though plainer than the magnificent Farmers' Market. But
     even granted trains, I fear that Omelas so far strikes some of
     you as goody-goody. Smiles, bells, parades, horses, bleh. If so,
     please add an orgy. If an orgy would help, don't hesitate. Let
     us not, however, have temples from which issue beautiful nude
     priests and priestesses already half in ecstasy and ready to
     copulate with any man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires
     union with the deep godhead of the blood, although that was my
     first idea. But really it would be better not to have any temples
     in Omelas - at least, not manned temples. Religion yes, clergy
     no. Surely the beautiful nudes can just wander about, offering
     themselves like divine souffles to the hunger of the needy and
     the rapture of the flesh. Let them join the processions. Let
     tambourines be struck above the copulations, and the glory of
     desire be proclaimed upon the gongs, and (a not unimportant
     point) let the offspring of these delightful rituals be beloved
     and looked after by all. One thing I know there is none of in
     Omelas is guilt. But what else should there be? I thought at
     first there were not drugs, but that is puritanical. For those
     who like it, the faint insistent sweetness of <i>drooz</i> may
     perfume the ways of the city, <i>drooz</i> which first brings a
     great lightness and brilliance to the mind and limbs, and then
     after some hours a dreamy languor, and wonderful visions at last
     of the very arcana and inmost secrets of the Universe, as well as
     exciting the pleasure of sex beyond belief; and it is not
     habit-forming. For more modest tastes I think there ought to be
     beer. What else, what else belongs in the joyous city? The sense
     of victory, surely, the celebration of courage. But as we did
     without clergy, let us do without soldiers. The joy built upon
     successful slaughter is not the right kind of joy; it will not
     do; it is fearful and it is trivial. A boundless and generous
     contentment, a magnanimous triumph felt not against some outer
     enemy but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls
     of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world's summer:
     this is what swells the hearts of the people of Omelas, and the
     victory they celebrate is that of life. I really don't think
     many of them need to take <i>drooz</i>.</p>

    <p>Most of the procession have reached the Green Fields by now. A
     marvelous smell of cooking goes forth from the red and blue tents
     of the provisioners. The faces of small children are amiably
     sticky; in the benign grey beard of a man a couple of crumbs of
     rich pastry are entangled. The youths and girls have mounted
     their horses and are beginning to group around the starting line
     of the course. An old women, small, fat, and laughing, is passing
     out flowers from a basket, and tall young men where her flowers
     in their shining hair. A child of nine or ten sits at the edge of
     the crowd, alone, playing on a wooden flute. People pause to
     listen, and they smile, but they do not speak to him, for he
     never ceases playing and never sees them, his dark eyes wholly
     rapt in the sweet, thin magic of the tune.</p>

    <p>He finishes, and slowly lowers his hands holding the wooden
     flute.</p>

    <p>As if that little private silence were the signal, all at once
     a trumpet sounds from the pavilion near the starting line:
     imperious, melancholy, piercing. The horses rear on their slender
     legs, and some of them neigh in answer. Sober-faced, the young
     riders stroke the horses' necks and soothe them, whispering,
     "Quiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope...." They begin to
     form in rank along the starting line. The crowds along the
     racecourse are like a field of grass and flowers in the wind. The
     Festival of Summer has begun.</p>

    <p>Do you believe? Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy?
     No? Then let me describe one more thing.</p>

    <p>In a basement under one of the beautiful public buildings of
     Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar of one of its spacious private
     homes, there is a room. It has one locked door, and no window. A
     little light seeps in dustily between cracks in the boards,
     secondhand from a cobwebbed window somewhere across the cellar.
     In one corner of the little room a couple of mops, with stiff,
     clotted, foul-smelling heads stand near a rusty bucket. The floor
     is dirt, a little damp to the touch, as cellar dirt usually is.
     The room is about three paces long and two wide: a mere broom
     closet or disused tool room. In the room a child is sitting. It
     could be a boy or a girl. It looks about six, but actually is
     nearly ten. It is feeble-minded. Perhaps it was born defective,
     or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and
     neglect. It picks its nose and occasionally fumbles vaguely with
     its toes or genitals, as it sits hunched in the corner farthest
     from the bucket and the two mops. It is afraid of the mops. It
     finds them horrible. It shuts its eyes, but it knows the mops are
     still standing there; and the door is locked; and nobody will
     come. The door is always locked; and nobody ever comes, except
     that sometimes - the child has no understanding of time or
     interval - sometimes the door rattles terribly and opens, and a
     person, or several people, are there. One of them may come in and
     kick the child to make it stand up. The others never come close,
     but peer in at it with frightened, disgusted eyes. The food bowl
     and the water jug are hastily filled, the door is locked, the
     eyes disappear. The people at the door never say anything, but
     the child, who has not always lived in the tool room, and can
     remember sunlight and its mother's voice, sometimes speaks.
     "I will be good," it says. "Please let me out. I will be
     good!" They never answer. The child used to scream for help at
     night, and cry a good deal, but now it only makes a kind of
     whining, "eh-haa, eh-haa," and it speaks less and less
     often. It is so thin there are no calves to its legs; its belly
     protrudes; it lives on a half-bowl of corn meal and grease a day.
     It is naked. Its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered
     sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually.</p>

    <p>They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of
     them have come to see it, others are content merely to know it is
     there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of them
     understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that
     their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of
     their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of
     their scholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance of
     their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend
     wholly on this child's abominable misery.</p>

    <p>This is usually explained to children when they are between
     eight and twelve, whenever they seem capable of understanding;
     and most of those who come to see the child are young people,
     though often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to see the
     child. No matter how well the matter has been explained to them,
     these young spectators are always shocked and sickened at the
     sight. They feel disgust, which they had thought themselves
     superior to. They feel anger, outrage, impotence, despite all the
     explanations. They would like to do something for the child. But
     there is nothing they can do. If the child were brought up into
     the sunlight out of that vile place, if it were cleaned and fed
     and comforted, that would be a good thing indeed; but if it were
     done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and
     delight of Omelas would wither and be destroyed. Those are the
     terms. To exchange all the goodness and grace of every life in
     Omelas for that single, small improvement: to throw away the
     happiness of thousands for the chance of the happiness of one:
     that would be to let guilt within the walls indeed.</p>

    <p>The terms are strict and absolute; there may not even be a kind
     word spoken to the child.</p>

    <p>Often the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage,
     when they have seen the child and faced this terrible paradox.
     They may brood over it for weeks or years. But as time goes on
     they begin to realize that even if the child could be released,
     it would not get much good of its freedom: a little vague
     pleasure of warmth and food, no doubt, but little more. It is too
     degraded and imbecile to know any real joy. It has been afraid
     too long ever to be free of fear. Its habits are too uncouth for
     it to respond to humane treatment. Indeed, after so long it would
     probably be wretched without walls about it to protect it, and
     darkness for its eyes, and its own excrement to sit in. Their
     tears at the bitter injustice dry when they begin to perceive the
     terrible justice of reality, and to accept it. Yet it is their
     tears and anger, the trying of their generosity and the
     acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true
     source of the splendor of their lives. Theirs is no vapid,
     irresponsible happiness. They know that they, like the child, are
     not free. They know compassion. It is the existence of the child,
     and their knowledge of its existence, that makes possible the
     nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the
     profundity of their science. It is because of the child that they
     are so gentle with children. They know that if the wretched one
     were not there sniveling in the dark, the other one, the
     flute-player, could make no joyful music as the young riders line
     up in their beauty for the race in the sunlight of the first
     morning of summer.</p>

    <p>Now do you believe in them? Are they not more credible? But
     there is one more thing to tell, and this is quite
     incredible.</p>

    <p>At times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go to see the
     child does not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go
     home at all. Sometimes also a man or woman much older falls
     silent for a day or two, and then leaves home. These people go
     out into the street, and walk down the street alone. They keep
     walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through the
     beautiful gates. They keep walking across the farmlands of
     Omelas. Each one goes alone, youth or girl, man or woman. Night
     falls; the traveler must pass down village streets, between the
     houses with yellow-lit windows, and on out into the darkness of
     the fields. Each alone, they go west or north, towards the
     mountains. They go on. They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into
     the darkness, and they do not come back. The place they go
     towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the
     city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible
     that it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are
     going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.</p>

    <h2>(Variations on a theme by William James)</h2>
    <h2>Reprinted from Ursula K. Le Guin's <u>The Wind's Twelve Quarters</u></h2>

    <p>The central idea of this psychomyth, the scapegoat, turns up in
     Dostoyevsky's <u>Brothers Karamazov</u>, and several people have
     asked me, rather suspiciously, why I gave the credit to William
     James. The fact is, I haven't been able to re-read Dostoyevsky,
     much as I loved him, since I was twenty-five, and I'd simply
     forgotten he used the idea. But when I met it in James's "The
     Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life," it was with a shock of
     recognition. Here is how James puts it:</p>

    <blockquote>"Or if the hypothesis were offered us of a world in
     which Messrs. Fourier's and Bellamy's and Morris's Utopias should
     all be outdone, and millions kept permanently happy on the one
     simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far-off edge of
     things should lead a life of lonely torment, what except a
     specifical and independent sort of emotion can it be which would
     make us immediately feel, even though an impulse arose within us
     to clutch at the happiness so offered, how hideous a thing would
     be its enjoyment when deliberately accepted as the fruit of such
     a bargain?"</blockquote>

    <p>The dilemma of the American conscience can hardly be better
     stated. Dostoyevsky was a great artist, and a radical one, but
     his early social radicalism reversed itself, leaving him a
     violent reactionary. Whereas the American James, who seems so
     mild, so naively gentlemanly - look how he says "us," assuming
     all his readers are as decent as himself! - was, and remained,
     and remains, a genuinely radical thinker. Directly after the
     "lost soul" passage he goes on,</p>

    <blockquote>"All the higher, more penetrating ideals are
     revolutionary. They present themselves far less in the guise of
     effects of past experience than in that of probable causes of
     future experience, factors to which the environment and the
     lessons it has so far taught us must learn to bend."</blockquote>

    <p>The application of those two sentences to this story, and to
     science fiction, and to all thinking about the future, is quite
     direct. Ideals as "the probable causes of future experience" -
     that is a subtle and an exhilarating remark!</p>

    <p>Of course I didn't read James and sit down and say. Now I'll
     write a story about that "lost soul." It seldom works that
     simply. I sat down and started a story, just because I felt like
     it, with nothing but the word "Omelas" in mind. It came from a
     road sign: Salem (Oregon) backwards. Don't you read road signs
     backwards? POTS. WOLS nerdlihc. Ocsicnarf Nas... Salem equals
     schelomo equals salaam equals Peace. Melas. O melas. Omelas.
     Homme helas. "Where do you get your ideas from, Ms Le Guin?" From
     forgetting Dostoyevsky and reading road signs backwards,
     naturally. Where else?</p>
