  A touching story/poem....
  
  
  I went to a party, Mom, I remembered what you said.
  You told me not to drink, Mom, so I drank soda instead.
  I really felt proud inside, Mom, the way you said I would.
  I didn't drink and drive, Mom, even though the others said I should.
  
  I know I did the right thing, Mom, I know you are always right.
  Now the party is finally ending, Mom, as everyone is driving out of sight.
  As I got into my car, Mom, I knew I'd get home in one piece.
  Because of the way you raised me, so responsible and sweet.
  
  I started to drive away, Mom, but as I pulled out into the road,
  the other car didn't see me, Mom, and hit me like a load.
  As I lay there on the pavement, Mom, I hear the policeman say,
  the other guy is drunk, Mom, and now I'm the one who will pay.
  
  I'm lying here dying, Mom.  I wish you'd get here soon.
  How could this happen to me, Mom?  My life just burst like a balloon.
  There is blood all around me, Mom, and most of it is mine.
  I hear the medic say, Mom, I'll die in a short time.
  
  I just wanted to tell you, Mom, I swear I didn't drink.
  It was the others, Mom.  The others didn't think.
  He was probably at the same party as I.
  The only difference is, he drank and I will die.
  
  Why do people drink, Mom?  It can ruin your whole life.
  I'm feeling sharp pains now.  Pains just like a knife.
  The guy who hit me is walking, Mom, and I don't think it's fair.
  I'm lying here dying and all he can do is stare.
  
  Tell my brother not to cry, Mom.  Tell Daddy to be brave.
  And when I go to heaven, Mom, put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave
  Someone should have told him, Mom, not to drink and drive.
  If only they had told him, Mom, I would still be alive.
  
  My breath is getting shorter, Mom.  I'm becoming very scared.
  Please don't cry for me, Mom.  When I needed you, you were always there.
  I have one last question, Mom, before I say good bye.
  I didn't drink and drive, so why am I the one to die?
