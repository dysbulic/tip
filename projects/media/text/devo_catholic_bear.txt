Once there was a man who was taking a hike in the woods when he came upon a
large, talking bear. The man had no gun, which the bear noticed. The man
was caught defenseless so he started praying. He got down on his knees and
said, Dear God, please let this be a Catholic bear." When the bear heard
this, he replied, "I am a Catholic bear." Then the bear walked over to the
man and began to pray, "Bless us, O Lord . . ."
