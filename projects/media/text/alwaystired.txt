		  EVER WONDER WHY YOU ARE ALWAYS TIRED?
		  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For a couple years I've been blaming it on iron poor blood, lack of 
vitamins, dieting and a dozen other maladies. But now I found out the real 
reason. I'm tired because I'm overworked.
     
The population of this country is 237 million. 104 million are retired. That 
leaves 133 million to do the work.
     
There are 85 million in school, which leave 48 million to do the work.
     
Of this there are 29 million employed by the federal government. This leaves 
19 million to do the work..
     
Four million are in the Armed Forces, which leaves 15 million to do the work.
     
Take from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for State and City 
Government and that leaves 200,000 to do the work.
     
There are 188,000 in hospitals, so that leaves 12,000 to do the work. Now, 
there are 11,998 people in Prisons. That leaves just two people to do the 
work.
     
     You and me.
     
     And you're sitting there reading humor email.
