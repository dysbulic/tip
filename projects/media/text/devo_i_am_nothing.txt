"There was a king, who, one day, entering his royal court, observed
one person who among all those present, was not bowing down before
him. Unnerved by the impudent act of this stranger in the hall, the
king called out: "How dare you not bow down before me! Only God does
not bow down before me, and there is nothing greater than God. Who
then are you?"

The tattered stranger answered with a smile, "I am that nothing."
