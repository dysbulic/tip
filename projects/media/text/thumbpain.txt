A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The
first of the twosome teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed
directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole.

Indeed, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his
hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll
around in evident agony.

The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize.
She then explained that she was a physical therapist: "Please allow me
to help. I'm a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain
if you'd just allow me!" she told him earnestly.

"Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I'll be alright...I'11 be fine in a few minutes,"
he replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal position still
clasping his hands together at his crotch.

But she persisted; and he finally allowed her to help him. She gently
took his hands away and laid them to the side, loosened his pants and
put her hands inside, beginning to massage him. "How does that feel?"
she asked.

"It feels great." he replied. "But my thumb still hurts like hell!"
