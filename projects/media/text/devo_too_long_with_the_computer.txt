You Know You've Been On The Computer Too Long...
***********************************************

When asked about a bus schedule, you wonder if it is 16 or 32 bits.

When you are counting objects, you go
"0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D...".

When you dream in 256 pallettes of 256 colors.

When your wife says "If you don't turn off that damn machine and come
to bed, then I am going to divorce you!", and you chastise her for for
omitting the "else" clause.

You try to sleep, and think sleep(8 * 3600); /* sleep for 8 hours */

When you are reading a book and look for the scroll bar to get to the
next page.

When after fooling around all day with routers etc, you pick up the
phone and start dialling an IP number...

When you get in the elevator and double-click the button for the floor
you want.

When not only do you check your email more often than your paper mail,
but you remember your {network address} faster than your postal one.

When you look for a icon to double-click to open your bedroom window.

When you go to balance your checkbook and discover that you're doing
the math in octal.

When you look for a trash can icon for throwing garbage.
