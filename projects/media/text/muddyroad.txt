                       Tanzan on the Muddy Road

     Tanzan and Ekido were once traveling together down a muddy road.
A heavy rain was falling. As they came around a bend, they met a
lovely girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross at an intersection. 

     "Come on, girl," said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms, 
he carried her over the mud. 

     Ekido did not speak until that night when they reached a lodging
temple. The he could no longer restrain himself.
     "We monks don't go near females," he told Tanzan, "especially not
young and lovely ones. It is dangerous. Why did you do that?" 

     "I left the girl there," said Tanzan. "Are you still carrying her?"
