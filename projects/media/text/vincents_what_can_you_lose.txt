"What Can You Lose?"

No way to tell you now.
All my chances fade into 
the darkness of my spirit;
for what could cause you to look 
into the eyes of this ghost,
this soul which passes
so briefly
through your life. 
This ghost, who
casts a shadow unseen
against the brightness of the
spotlight,
whose voice is only an
echo
in a vast, empty theatre.
No one listens
to the voice of this ghost,
or looks
into her eyes,
for they do not hear or see her. But I know
that you do believe in ghosts.
And so perhaps you will look
and you will listen.
And perhaps you will see your soul,
and hear it
sing.
