                         Grant me the serenity
                         to accept the things I
                            cannot change.
                        The courage to change the
                         things I cannot accept,
                         and the wisdom to hide
                       the bodies of those people
                          I had to kill today
                                because
                          they pissed me off
                              and also,
                       help me to be careful of
                       the toes I step on today,
                       as they may be connected
                         to the ass that I may
                             have to kiss
                              tomorrow.
