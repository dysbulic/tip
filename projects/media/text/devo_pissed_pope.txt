There was a Pope who was greatly loved by all of his followers, a man
who led with gentleness, faith and wisdom.  His passing was grieved by
the entire world, Catholic or not.
  
As the Pope approached the gates of heaven, it was Saint Peter who
greeted him in a firm embrace.
  
"Welcome your holiness, your dedication and unselfishness in serving
your fellow man during your life has earned you great stature in
heaven. You may pass through the gates without delay and are granted
free access to all parts of heaven."
  
"You are also granted an open door policy and may at your own
discretion meet with any heavenly leader, including the Father without
prior appointment.  Is there anything which your holiness desires?"
  
"Well yes," the Pope replied.  "I have often pondered some of the
mysteries which have puzzled and confounded theologians through the
ages.  Are there perhaps any transcripts which recorded the actual
conversations between God and the prophets of old?  I would love to
see what was actually said, without the dimming of memories over
time."
  
Saint Peter immediately ushered the Pope to the heavenly library and
explained how to retrieve the various documents.  The Pope was
thrilled and settled down to review the history of man's relationship
with God.
  
Two years later a scream of anguish pierced the stacks of the library.
Immediately several of the Saints and angels came running to the
Pope's side to learn the cause of his dismay.
  
There they found the Pope pointing to a single word on the parchment,
repeating over and over, "There's an 'R', There's an 'R'!!!"
  
"Look, the word is celibrate, not celibate!"
