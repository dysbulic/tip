The most pervasive myth about enlightenment is that it eradicates any trace of
personality. This is derived partly from early Western writings on Buddhism
and translation in which "personality" and "ego" were used interchangeably;
"dropping the ego"-the prime guide for Buddhist practice- became synonymous
with having no personality. In Buddhism "personality" may have more to do with
the doctrine of karma than psychoanalytic theory, but neither view leaves
anyone independent of inclinations, talents, and characteristics. Roughly
speaking, the extent to which one gets attached to ones personality and allows
those attachments to control ones identity and predetermine ones actions is a
matter of ego.
