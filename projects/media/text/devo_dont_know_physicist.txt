   Here are a couple of excerpts taken from lectures to a general 
audience by the late (and most wonderful) Nobel Prize winnng physicist 
Richard P. Feynman:

	"What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our 
	physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate 
	school -- and you think I'm going to explain it to you so 
	you can understand it?  No, you're not going to be able to
	understand it.  Why, then, am I going to bother you with all
	this?  Why are you going to sit here all this time, when you
	won't be able to understand what I am going to say?  It is my
	task to convince you *not* to turn away because you don't
	understand it.  You see, my physics students don't understand 
	it either.  That is because *I* don't understand it.  Nobody
	does.
			   -----------------
	
	Finally, there is this possibility: after I tell you 
	something you just can't believe it.  You can't accept it.  
	You don't like it.  A little screen comes down and you don't
	listen anymore.  I'm going to describe to you how Nature 
	is---and if you don't like, that's going to get in the way 
	of your understanding it.  It is a problem that physicists 
	have learned to deal with.  They've learned to realize that
	whether they like a theory or don't like a theory is *not* 
	the essential question.  Rather, it is whether or not the 
	theory gives predictions that agree with experiment.  It is 
	not a question of whether a theory is philosophically 
	delightful, or easy to understand, or perfectly reasonable 
	from the point of view of common sense.  The theory of 
	quantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from 
	the point of view of common sense.  And it agrees fully 
	with 	experiment.  So I hope you can accept Nature 
	as she is -- absurd.
