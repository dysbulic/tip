Donkey Racing

A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that
there was a fortune in horse racing, decided to purchase one and enter
it in the races. However at the local auction, the going price for
horses was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead. He
figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it
in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in third! The next day
the local paper carried this headline:

PREACHER'S ASS SHOWS

The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the
race again, and this time it won. The paper read:

PREACHER'S ASS OUT IN FRONT

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered
the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. The paper
headline read:

BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS

This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get
rid of the donkey. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a
nearby convent. The paper headline the next day read:

NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN

The Bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid
of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for $10.00. Next day the
headline read:

NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00

This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back
the donkey, lead it to the plains where it could run wild and free.
Next day, the headline in the paper read:

NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE

The Bishop was buried the next day.
