    <h1>An Appointment in Baghdad</h1>

    <p>One day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenali_Ramakrishna">Tenalirama</a> was walking down the street when a good friend of his came running down the street.</p>

    <p>"Tenalirama! Tenalirama! You must help me. I was just in the market and standing by one of the stalls was Death himself. We saw each other at the same time and Death pointed at me. Death is looking for me. Please, Tenmalirama, help me &mdash; lend me a horse so I can ride to Samara where Death will not be able to find me."</p>

    <p>Tenalirama agreed and his friend headed off in haste. Later that day as Tenalirama was walking the street, he saw Death emerging from a house and called to him: "Death," said Tenalirama, "why have you frightened my friend so? When you pointed at him in the market this morning, it upset him badly."</p>

    <p>"In the market? I have not been pointing at your friend. I only saw him briefly in the market this morning and I only had time for a start of surprise and he ran away," replied Death.</p>

    <p>"Why would you be surprised by my friend?" asked Tenalirama. "Surely of everyone you have the best idea of what will come to pass."</p>

    <p>"I was astonished to see your friend here in Baghdad," replied Death. "We have an appointment this evening in Samsara.</p>
