I received a letter that is addressed to everyone.  Here it is.

	I had to write to tell you how much I love you and care for you. 
Yesterday, I saw you walking and laughing with your friends; I hoped that soon
you'd want me to walk along with you, too.  So, I painted you a sunset to close
your day and whispered a cool breeze to refresh you.  I waited--you never
called--I just kept on loving you.
	As I watched you fall asleep last night, I wanted to touch you.  I
spilled moonlight onto your face--trickling down your cheeks as so many tears
have.  You didn't even think of Me; I wanted so much to comfort you.
	The next day I exploded a brilliant sunrise into glorious morning for
you.  But you woke up late and rushed off to class--you didn't even notice.  My
sky became cloudy and My tears were the rain.
	I love you, oh, if you'd only listen.  I really love you.  I try to say
it in the quiet of the green meadow and in the blue sky.  The wind whispers My
love throughout the treetops and spills it into the vibrant colors of all the
flowers.  I shout it to you in the thunder of the great waterfalls and compose
love songs for birds to sing to you.  I warm you with the clothing of My
sunshine and perfume the air with nature's sweet scent.  My love for you is
deeper than any ocean and greater than any need in your heart.  If you'd only
realize how I care.
	My Dad sends His love.  I want you to meet Him--He cares too.  Fathers
are just that way.  So, please; call on Me soon.  No matter how long it takes,
I'll wait--because I love you.


					Your friend,
					Jesus
