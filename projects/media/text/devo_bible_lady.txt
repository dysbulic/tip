There was a religious lady that had to do a lot of traveling for her
business, so she did a lot of flying. Flying made her very very
nervous, so she always took her Bible along with her to read as
it helped relax her on the long fights.

One time, she was sitting next to a man.  When he saw her pull 
out her Bible, he gave a little chuckle and smirk and went back 
to what he was doing.

After awhile, he turned to her and asked, "You don't really believe all
that stuff in there do you?"

The lady replied, "Of course I do. It is the Bible."

He said, "Well, what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?"

She replied, "Oh, Jonah. Yes, I believe that, it is in the Bible."

He asked, "Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time 
inside the whale?"

The lady said, "Well, I don't really know. 
I guess when I get to heaven, I will ask him."

"What if he isn't in heaven?" the man asked sarcastically.

"Then you can ask him," replied the lady.
