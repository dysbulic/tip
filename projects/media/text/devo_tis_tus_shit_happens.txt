 Tis Thus:
 
 In the beginning was the Plan.
 
 And then came the Assumptions.
 
 And the Assumptions were without form.
 
 And the Plan was without substance.
 
 And darkness was upon the face of the Workers.
 
 And they spoke among themselves, saying, "It is a crock of
 shit, and it stinks."
 
 And the Workers went unto their Supervisors and said, "It
 is a pail of dung, and we can't live with the smell."
 
 And the Supervisors went unto their Managers, saying, "It
 is a container of excrement, and it is very strong, such
 that none may abide by it."
 
 And the Managers went unto their Directors, saying, "It is
 a vessel of fertilizer, and none may endure its strength."
 
 And the Directors spoke among themselves, saying to one
 another, "It contains that which aids plant growth, and it
 is very strong."
 
 And the Directors went to the Vice Presidents, saying unto
 them, "It promotes growth, and it is very powerful."
 
 And the Vice Presidents went to the President, saying unto
 him, "This new Plan will actively promote growth and vigor
 with very powerful effects."
 
 And the President looked upon the Plan and saw that it was
 good.
 
 And the Plan became Policy.

 
 And that's how shit happens.
