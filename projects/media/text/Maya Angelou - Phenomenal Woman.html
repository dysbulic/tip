    <h1>Phenomenal Woman by Maya Angelou</h1>
<div>
Pretty women wonder where my secret lies
I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
But when I start to tell them
They think I'm telling lies
I say
It's in the reach of my arms
The span of my hips
The stride of my steps
The curl of my lips 
I'm a woman
Phenomenally
Phenomenal woman
That's me
<div>
I walk into a room
Just as cool as you please
And to a man
The fellows stand or
Fall down on their knees
Then they swarm around me
A hive of honey bees
I say
It's the fire in my eyes
And the flash of my teeth
The swing of my waist
And the joy in my feet
I'm a woman
Phenomenally
Phenomenal woman
That's me          
<div>
Men themselves have wondered
What they see in me
They try so much
But they can't touch
My inner mystery
When I try to show them
They say they still can't see
I say
It's in the arch of my back
The sun of my smile
The ride of my breasts
The grace of my style
I'm a woman
Phenomenally
Phenomenal woman
That's me
<div>
Now you understand
Just why my head's not bowed
I don't shout or jump about
Or have to talk real loud   
When you see me passing
It ought to make you proud
I say
It's in the click of my heels
The bend of my hair
The palm of my hand
The need for my care
'Cause I'm a woman
Phenomenally
Phenomenal woman
That's me</div></div></div></div>
