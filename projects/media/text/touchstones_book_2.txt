		Mental Touchstones for the Searching Spirit
                                    by:
			    K. Bradford Brown

Introduction:
	Mental touchstones for the Searching Spirit
These pieces, dedicated to the searching spirit, will speak to those who are
engaged in what W. B. Yeats called: 'that endless research into life, death,
God, that is everyone's reverie...'
	They may be seen as a point of reference, a touchstone in this search.
The touchstone was once an instrument of alchemy, used to test the purity of
gold. The word still carries the meaning of a measure, like a 'yardstick' or
'rule of thumb': a point by which the truth of our emotional and spiritual
lives may be revealed.
	These pieces are short, aphoristic, yet they are not quite 'aphorisms'.
Aphorisms offer a comforting banality, they please us because they confirm what
we always thought we knew.
	In the search for knowledge, they evoke another kind of knowing. Like
the classic Zen koan they have a disquietying, paradoxical quality which
presents a challenge to our rationality, in a form our rationality cannot
ignore.
	In the search for truth, they ring of the truth, yet they remind us of
something contradictory about truth itself, which confronts our easy, everyday
acceptance of the obvious.
	In the search for wisdom, they offer support. When you are struggling,
they can make things seem simple. When you are feeling lost, they can bring you
back to earth. And when you are feeling hopeless, they will make you laugh.

As Ivor Cutler wrote:

	"Please, mister
	   will you be my touchstone?
	Sitting by you
	   sets me straight..."

			Don't wait

			Life's first commandment:
				Wake up.
			Life's intermediate commandments:
				Wake up.
			Life's last commandment:
				Stay awake!

			How is it
			   that some people
				can live
				   a lifetime
			   and never
				ask
				   who am I?

			       *****
				 6

			It all ends
			   and begins
				with death
				   and resurrection
			   exemplified
				in a thousand
				   different forms
				and faces.

			Never didn't.

			Life is
			   the greatest
				stimulant
				   you
				will
				   ever
				need!

			       *****

			We have inadequate language
			   to describe our
				experience
				     of "it",
			   because "it"
				is not yet
				   our
				     experience.

			       *****

			If you get it
			   it will be
				in spite of
				   any method
					you use.

			That's how
			   it works.

			And you
			   need a method.

			       ******
				 10

			When all else fails
			   don't pray to God
				to fix it.
			He's not the local repairman,
			   but the gremlin
				in the
				   works.

			       ******
				 11

			God
			   comes to us
				in many disguises.

			Are you noticing
			    which one
				He is wearing
				   now?

			       ******
				 12

			"The Kingdom of Heaven
			   is at hand" means
				there is another order
				   or dominion
					present
				that we are not
					noticing.

			That we do not notice
			   does not excuse us
				from the consequences
				   of acting
					or believing that
				no such thing exists.

			       ******
				 13

			Our lives are based
			   on compromises.

			In this domain 
			   it is either or.

			We are doing it
			   or we are not.

			And there are
			   no deals.

			       ******
				 14

			It's easier
				when you
				   trust the process
				whether
				   you are being
			   nailed to a cross
				or
			     having your teeth pulled.

			       ******
				 15

			God
			  does not require us
			     to be
				  what we
					ought to be,

			  but 
			     what he
			       has already
				  made us,

			  and
                             that
                               is enough.

			       ******
				 16

			Before you start
			   any journey
			complete the last one,
			or you'll discover
			   the old and new path
				are on
				    an inevitable
					collision
					   course.

			Love
                            is
                              the

			Each new moment

			Living for the truth,

			The choice

			I can't miss

			Getting agreement from others

			Sharing the state

			True enlightenment

			We

			Believing in God

			   is
                             what's next.

			Your mental devils
			   were once
				the best
			   resources
				of your

			When the sacred
			   is secular
				and
			   the secular
				is sacred,
			we will see
			   another
				change.

			       *******
				 148

			God's dominion
			   is sovereign
				over all other
				   domains
					of existence.

			The conditions and "rules"
			   of this dominion
				transcend,
				   supercede,
					and
				transform
				   all
                                      others
                                          in its path.

			       *******
				 149

			In this
			   domain
				the darkness
				   and the
				light
                                     are
                                        not
                                           different.

			       *******
				 150

			The Spirit of God
			   is upon
				you...
				   never wasn't.

			       *******
				 151

			You
			   didn't
                                 go
                                   though
                                         all
                                            this
			   for
                              nothing.

			       *******
				 152

			When we are clear
			   we deliver ourselves
				from imagination,
				   illusion
					and
                                           lies.

			Objectivity is at hand.

			Only then
			   may we be
				truly free
				   to create
			   our lives
				and our
			   world.

			       *******
				 153

			There are no
			   extraordinary
				people

			   only ordinary people
				who do
				   extraordinary
					things
			   with what
				they have
				   been given.

			       *******
				 154

			If the only prayer you say in your life
			  is "thank you", that would suffice.
