You don't have to send this to all of your friends. Those to whom you do
send it, however, I believe would appreciate it. Add to it as you pass it
along for the little or big things in life you want your friends to have
and to know. Sometimes, in the hustle and bustle of life, we neglect our
friends, and these little things that friendships entail. These things
are precious, as are our friends. They are forever. Don't let them go.
