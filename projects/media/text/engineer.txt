       An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates.  St. Peter checks
      his  dossier and says, "Ah, you're an engineer -- you're in the wrong
      place." So the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in.
      Pretty soon,  the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort
      in hell, and starts designing and building improvements.  After a
      while, they've got  air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators,
      and the engineer is a  pretty popular guy.  One day God calls Satan up
      on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So,  how's it going down
      there in hell?"  Satan replies, "Hey, things are going great.  We've
      got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators,  and there's no
      telling what this engineer is going to come up with next." God
      replies, "What???  You've got an engineer?  That's a mistake -- he
      should  never have gotten down there; send him up here."  Satan says,
      "No way.  I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping
      him."  God says,  "Send him back up here or I'll sue."  Satan laughs
      uproariously and answers, "Yeah, right.  And just where are YOU going
      to get a lawyer?"
