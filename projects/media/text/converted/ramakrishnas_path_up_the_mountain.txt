	"God has made different religions to suit different
aspirations, times, and countries. All doctrines are only so many
paths; but a path is by no means God Himself. Indeed, one can reach
God if one follows any of the paths with wholehearted devotion. One
may eat a cake with icing either straight or sidewise. It will taste
sweet either way. As one can ascend to the top of a house by means of
a ladder or a bamboo or a staircase or a rope, so diverse are the ways
to approach God, and every religion in the world shows one of these
ways.
	"Bow down and worship where others kneel, for where so many
have adored, the kind Lord must manifest himself, for he is all
mercy.
	"People partition off their lands by means of boundaries, but
no one can partition off the all-embracing sky overhead. The
indivisible sky surrounds all and includes all. So it is ignorant
people who say, 'My religion is the only one, my religion is the
best.' When a heart is illuminated by true knowledge, it knows that
above all these wars of sects and sectarians presides the one
indivisible, eternal, all- knowing bliss.
	"There was a man who worshiped Shiva, but hated all other
deities. One day Shiva appeared to him and said, 'I shall never be
pleased with you as long as you hate other gods.' The man, though,
was stubborn. After a few Shiva again appeared to him and
repeated, 'I shall never be pleased with you while you hate.' The
man kept silent.
	"Several more days elapsed, after which Shiva made a third
appearance. This time one side of his body was Shiva and the other
Vishnu. Half pleased and half displeased, the man shifted his
offering to the side representing Shiva. Shiva gave up, saying, 'This
man's bigotry is incorrigible.'"
