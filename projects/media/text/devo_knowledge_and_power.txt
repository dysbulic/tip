In case you've ever wondered why ignorance rises to the executive level,
here is a simple explanation that is also mathematical proof:

Knowledge is Power.

Time is Money.

And, as every engineer knows: Power = Work / Time

If Knowledge = Power, and Time = Money, then: Knowledge = Work / Money

Solving for Money, we get: Money = Work / Knowledge

Thus, Money approaches infinity as Knowledge approaches zero, regardless
of the Work done.

What this means is: The Less you Know, the More you Make.

I KNEW someone would eventually prove this!

Bad News: If you understand this, then you likely have a large knowledge
base and therefore are subject to making less money. Damn shame.
