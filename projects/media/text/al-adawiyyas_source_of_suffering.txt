The source of my grief and loneliness is deep in my breast.
This is a disease no doctor can cure.
Only Union with the Friend can cure it.
I was not born to the Grief of God -
I only grieve to be like those
Who are pierced with the Love of God -
I would be ashamed for my love
To appear less than the grief of others:
Therefore I grieve.

--Rabi'a Al-Adawiyya
