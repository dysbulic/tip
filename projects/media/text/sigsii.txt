"A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser.
 It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt
 as such to him who has done the wrong."
		-Edgar Allan Poe "The Cask of Amontillado"
"Copulation is spiritual in essence -- or it merely friendly exercise.
 On second thought, strike out "merely" -- even when it is just a
 happy pastime for two strangers.
 But copulation at its spiritual best is so much more than physical coupling
 that it differs in kind as well as degree.
 The saddest feature of homosexuality is not that it is "wrong" or "sinful"
 or even that it can't lead to progeny - but that it is more difficult to
 reach through it this spiritual union.
 Not impossible - but the cards are stacked against it.
 But - most sorrowfully - many people never achieve spiritual sharing
 even with the help of a male-female advantage;
 they are condemned to live life alone."
		-Robert Hienlien
"Stupidity cannot be cured with money, or through education, or by
 legislation. Stupidity is not a sin, the victim can't help being stupid.
 But stupidity is the only universal capital crime; the sentence is
 death, there is no appeal, and the execution is carried out automatically,
 and without pity."

		-Marguerite Duras "Hiroshima Mon Amour"
"    That summer he was an eagle. Free. Mating in the air. Never touching 
 down. Never looking back. That summer. His hands that touched her were wings. 
 And he flew and the feathers covered the scars that grew where their bodies
 had touched.
     He was of the air and she was of the earth. She muddied his dreams.
 She had a woman's body but lacked a woman's spirit. A star is a stone
 to the blind. She saw him through crippled eyes. She possessed. He shared.
 There was no life between them. He saw the stars and counted them one
 by one into her hand, that gift that all lovers share. She saw stones.
 And she turned away.
     He was free because he needed. She was a prisoner because she wanted.
 One day she was gone. And he folded his wings and the earth came rushing 
 at him and he was an old man with a small son. And he lived in a cage and 
 was three years dead. And his son was a small hope that had melted.
 He was his mother's son. He could see that in his son's eyes. It was
 something that the old man would always regret."

"Do not try. Do or do not. There is no try"
		-Yoda
"You are not here to verify,
 Instruct yourself, or inform curiousity
 Or carry report.  You are here to kneel
 Where prayer has been valid.  And prayer is more
 Than an order of words, the conscious occupation
 Of the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying."
		-T.S.Eliot, "Little Gidding I"
"It's the end of the war.
 I don't know if I feel sleepy or not.
 For some time now I haven't known what sleep is.
 I wake up, so I know I've been asleep."
		-Marguerite Duras
"This is the true joy of life
 Being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one
 Being a force of nature
 instead of a feverish, selfish, little clod of ailments & grievances
 complaining that the world will not devote itself
 to making you happy"
 
"I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community
 and as long as I live, it is my privilege
 to do for it what ever I can.
 I want to be thoroughly used up when I die
 for the harder I work, the more I live.
 I rejoice in life for it's own sake."
 
"Life is no brief candle to me,
 it is a sort of splendid torch
 which I've got a hold of for a moment.
 And I want to make it burn as brightly as possible
 before handing it on to future generations."
		-George Bernard Shaw
"I do not call it his sign,
 I do not call it becoming one with his sign.
 I do not call it union.
 I do not call it harmony with union.
 I do not say something has happened, 
 I do not say nothing has happened.
 I will not name it You,
 I will not name it I.
 Now that the White Jasmine Lord is myself,
 What use for words at all?"
		 -Mahadeviyakka (trans. Jane Hirshfield)
"It was like a stream
 running into the dry bed
 of a lake,"

"like rain
 pouring on plants
 parched to sticks."

"It was like this world's pleasure
 and the way to the other,
 both
 walking toward me."

"Seeing the feet of the master,
 O lord white as jasmine,
 I was made
 worthwhile." 
		-Mahadeviyakka (trans. A.K. Ramanujan)
"I said to my soul, be still and wait without hope
 For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love
 For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith
 But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.
 Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought;
 So that darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing."
		-T.S. Eliot "East Coker III"

"They can point their fingers
 Push me nearer to the flame
 God, You can save me from the fire
 I'm Yours, even if You don't
 Whatever comes I take this vow
 I will never bow..."

 And what is to become of those who

"How could anyone ever tell you
 You were anything less than beautiful
 How could anyone ever tell you
 You were less than whole?"

"How could anyone fail to notice
 That your loving is a miracle
 How deeply you're connected
 To my soul?"
		-Libby Roderick
"O Lord, grant that we may always be right,
 Thou knowest we will never change our minds."

"And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers,
 But all that lives is born to die,
 And so I say to you that nothing really matters,
 And all you do is stand and cry.

"There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers
 exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly
 disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and
 inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has
 already happened."
		-Douglas Adams
"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity,

"Why am I a stranger in my own life?"
		-Sheryl Crow
"Anyone who is content to merely to break with the past
 loses the life of the spirit.  In the search for the living god 
 you must sometimes shatter images that have become unworthy
 in order to create room for a new one."
		-Martin Buber
"A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a 
 calm and peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a 
 transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.  I do not 
 think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this 
 rule.  If the study to which you apply yourself has a 
 tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste 
 for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, 
 then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not 
 befitting the human mind.  If this rule were always observed; 
 if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the 
 tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been 
 enslaved; Caesar would have spared his country; America would 
 have been discovered more gradually; and the empires of Mexico 
 and Peru had not been destroyed."
		-Mary Shelley "Frankenstein"
"What I want is what I've not got,
 What I need is all around me."
		-Dave Matthews "Jimi Thing"
"I got my bones beneath my skin, and mister...
 There's a skeleton in every man's house
 Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody
 There's a dead man trying to get out."
