                              The Song of Songs

There is one who sings the song of his soul,  
discovering in his soul everything -- utter spiritual fulfillment.

There is one who sings the song of his people. 
Emerging from the private circle of his soul -- not expansive enough,  
not yet tranquil -- he strives for fierce heights, 
clinging to the entire community of Israel in tender love...

Then there is one whose soul expands 
until it extends beyond the border of Israel,  
singing the song of humanity... his spirit spreads, 
aspiring to the goal of humankind, 
envisioning its consummation...

Then there is one who expands 
even further until he unites with all existence,
with all creatures, with all worlds, singing a song with them all.

There is one who ascends with all these songs 
in unison -- the song of the soul, the song of the nation, 
the song of humanity,  
the song of the cosmos -- resounding together, 
blending in harmony, circulating the sap of life, the sound of holy joy.

Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook
