A boy once said to God,"I've been thinking, and I know what I want
when I become a man."  He proceeded to give God his list:  to live in
a big house with two Saint Bernard's and a garden...marry a blue eyed,
tall, beautiful woman...have three sons-one who will be a senator, one
a scientist, and one a quarterback.  He also wanted to be an
adventurer who climbed tall mountains..and to drive a red Ferrari.
As it turned out, the boy hurt his knee one day while playing
football.  He no longer could climb trees, much less mountains.  He
married a beautiful and kind woman, who was short with brown eyes. 
Because of his business, he lived in a city apartment, took cabs, and
rode subways.  He had three loving daughters, and they adopted a
fluffy cat.  One daughter became a nurse, another an artist, and the
third a music teacher.
One morning the man awoke and remembered his boyhood dream.  He became
extremely depressed, so depressed he became very ill.  Close to death
from a broken heart, he called out to God, "Remember when I was a boy
and told You all the tings I wanted?  Why didn't You give me those
things?"
"I could have, "said God, "but I wanted to make you happy."
Remember, God wants the best for us.  Trust Him with your whole heart-
He's the original heart surgeon.


"God can heal a broken heart, but he has to have all the pieces."

"My son, give me thine heart..."  -Proverbs 23:26
