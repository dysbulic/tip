    <p>Ok, it is 11:30pm. I leave town at 8am. I need to have a set of
    CDs to do an automatic XP install before I go. Can I do it? We'll
    see&hellip;</p>
    <p><strong>11:30pm</strong>: I've already got the basics worked
    out with information from <a
    href="http://unattended.msfn.org/">unattended.msfn.org</a>. I've
    <a href="eltorito_extraction.html">the eltorito image</a> and <a
    href="lockdown.reg">a set or registry restrictions</a>. I can use
    <a
    href="http://unattended.msfn.org/global/cdimage.htm">CDImage</a>
    to create images even though mkisofs's don't. The <a
    href="winnt.sif">unattended install config</a> I'm using seems
    pretty good and I only accidentally reformatted one machine in
    developing that, so that's good. &#x263A;</p>
    <p>Where I'm stuck right now is scripting the user account
    creation. I have three user accounts which are in three different
    character sets. (I'm using XP's
    <a href="Multilanguage User Interface">MUI</a>.
    "<code>student</code>" is the English speaking
    student account and it is
    <acronym title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</acronym>.
    "<code>Ã©tudiant</code>" is the French account in ISO-8859-1 and
    "<code>&#x637;&#x627;&#x644;&#x628;&#x629;</code>" in the Arabic
    account in ISO-8859-6. The obvious solution when writing the
    script to run <code>net user</code> is UTF-8. The problem is my
    French account is coming in as <code>&#xC3;&#xA9;tudiant</code>
    meaning the multibyte characters are being misinterpreted as
    ISO-8859-1. I switched from a batch file to a VBScript in hopes of
    bypassing the command interpreter and fixing the problem, but to
    no avail.</p>

    <p><strong>12:30</strong>: First, I need to get the languages
    right in my install. (The systems here can't access microsoft.com
    from time to time and I couldn't do get the codes when I did the
    original install. I can get to the <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/win2k/setup/localsupport.mspx">language
    ids</a> and <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/win2k/setup/lcid.mspx">locales</a>
    now.)</p>

    <p><strong>1:00</strong>: I figure that all the <code>net
    user</code> command does is add some registry entries since the
    <code>Default User</code> files aren't copied over until the first
    login. How can I find out which keys are added? Maybe I could diff
    the registry hives. Those files are located at:
    <code>%WinDir%\system32\config\(software|system|sam|security|default)</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>1:30</strong>: Creating the ISO and burning it takes
    forever. Especially since I'm creating the image on my laptop via
    a samba share burning to a CD-RW with cdrecord. Attempt one
    wouldn't boot, so I'm trying again&hellip;</p>

    <p><strong>2:00</strong>: Grr, still not working&hellip; Going to
    do an install with my old disk that does England as the default
    locale so I have something to test with while working.</p>

    <p><strong>2:30</strong>: I have found one thing that may help
    with a problem I haven't gotten to addressing yet. When I create
    the user accounts, I need to change some of the registry settings.
    I want to both lock down the system and set the interface
    language. This is a problem because even if I figure out how to
    create accounts without using the <code>net user</code> command,
    the user profiles are not copied from the <code>Default
    User</code> profile until the first time the user logs in. The
    <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> hive is in the user's profile, so I
    can't change it until the profile has been copied over.</p>
    <p>It turns out that profile copying is called Active Setup and
    includes a process called Just In Time configuration (JIT, like
    the java compiler). In addition there are a set of keys that
    control programs that are run when the account is created under a
    GUID at: <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed
    Components</code> with the <code>REG_SZ</code> (or, better,
    <code>REG_EXPAND_SZ</code>) value <code>StubPath</code>,
    <code>REG_SZ</code> value <code>ComponentID</code> and
    <code>REG_DWORD</code> value <code>IsInstalled</code> set to
    <code>1</code>. Hopefully I can write a script that does the
    lockdown and sets the MUI language.</p>

    <p><strong>8:00</strong>: Shit fire. I have been going around in
    circles trying to get this system to boot. The damned CD-ROM drive
    doesn't read CD-RWs. I've been assuming the problem was with the
    image and deleted the original sources. How do I get them
    back?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Copy <code>i386</code> and files off the root of the
      original CD</li>
      <li>Slipstream the service pack with <code>xpsp1a_en_x86.exe
      -s:'c:\temp\xp_cd\'</code></li>
      <li>Delete 9x and NT upgrades from <code>i386</code></li>
      <li>Copy <a href="winnt.sif">winnt.sif</a> into
      <code>i386</code></li>
      <li>Run <a
      href="http://unattended.msfn.org/global/cdimage.htm">CDImage</a>
      on the results</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>9:00</strong>: Head is getting fuzzy from too much
    computer. The absolute latest I can leave is 1. The <a
    href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnanchor/html/anch_wmi.asp">Windows
    Management Instrumentation</a> looks like a good bet for creating
    accounts. If I weren't going dumb from overdosing on caffeine, I'd
    probably have figured out how to use it by now&hellip;</p>

    <p><strong>10:00</strong>: I hate computers.</p>

    <p><strong>11:00</strong>: Ok, I am making some progress using the
    Active Directory Services Interface to interact with the Security
    Account Manager. Thank Jesus.</p>

    <p><strong>11:30</strong>: It looks as if the majority of my CD
    booting problems were coming from the fact I was using a CD-RW to
    test. Both of mt test machines are cast-offs from the embassy, so
    they're pretty old. Now that I've switched over it seems to be
    working fine. It means that I'll make some useless CDs, but it's
    well worth it.</p>

    <p><strong>12:00</strong>: I'm pretty sure I've got a <a
    href="create_user.vbs">working script</a> to create the users. I
    have to wait for the install to finish to find out. 30 minutes.
    Damn.</p>
