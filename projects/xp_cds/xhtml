    <h1><acronym title="Girls' Mentoring Center">GMC</acronym> Setup</h1>
    <p>Alright, I am here in Mauritania and I've been collecting bits
    and pieces of software for the last two years and I'm trying to
    get all wrapped up now. So that other people can have a clue as to
    what I've been doing, this is a record of the different bits.</p>

    <h2>Automated XP Install</h2>
    <p>The GMCs are run by volunteers with a variety of backgrounds.
    Some are comfortable with computers and software installations,
    but others are not. To this end I want to have a largely <a
    href="http://unattended.msfn.org">unattended install</a>. To this
    end I made a <a href="winnt.sif">unattended install config</a>
    which goes in the <code>i386</code> folder.</p>

    <p>Recreating the bootable CD is something I've already worked on,
    by <a href="eltorito_extraction.html">extracting the ElTorito
    image</a> and using <a
    href="http://unattended.msfn.org/global/cdimage.htm">CDImage</a>
    (since <code>mkisofs</code> doesn't work).</p>

    <h2>Slipstream</h2>

    <p>I tried for a week to download the second service pack without
    success. In the end I had to <a href="slipstream.cmd">go with the
    first</a> because time was too short.</p>

    <h2><acronym title="Multi-language User Interface">MUI</acronym></h2>

    <p>Mauritania is an interesting environment to deploy software in.
    Particularly at the GMCs because girls' education is generally a
    low priority. It means that girls are frequently only partially
    educated in a widely used language, and because of racial issues
    in Mauritania some girls will know only French while others know
    only Arabic.</p>

    <p>A bit part of dealing with this is the deployment of XP's MUI.
    It allows the users language to be configured as either English,
    French or Arabic depending on the account. Supposedly the
    translation is about 90% of what you get with a localized version
    which is good enough.</p>

    <h2>Account Creation</h2>

    <p>The account creation is a little more complicated. The problem
    is that there are three accounts I want to create, one for each of
    the available languages. The name of the account is simply
    "student" in the appropriate language (student, étudiant, and
    طالبة). The problem is that the command interpreter only supports
    8-bit characters. I could use ISO-8859-1 for the Latin or
    ISO-8859-6 for the Arabic, but to have both in the same file, I
    need unicode. I tried UTF-8: didn't work. I tried UTF-16: didn't
    work. Both were interpreted as ISO-8859-1. So, I ended up
    abandoning <code>net user</code> and went with some <a
    href="create_user.vbs">VBScript</a>.</p>

    <h2>Lockdown</h2>

    <p>After I've created the accounts I need to change some registry
    keys to configure the interface language and homepage and whatnot.
    The problem is that these keys go into the
    <code>CURRENT_USER</code> hive and this hive is stored in
    <code>%USERPROFILE%\ntuser.dat</code>. <code>%USERPROFILE%</code>
    isn't created until the user logs in for the first time. I could
    require the person doing the setup to log into each account and
    then run a program, but that's not a very elegant solution.</p>
    
    <p>A better solution involves manipulating the process by which
    the profile is created. The process is called "Active Setup" and
    one part of it involves a set of keys at:
    <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed
    Components</code>. Each key is a <acronym
    title="Globally Unique Identifier">GUID</acronym>
    with the <code>REG_SZ</code> (or, better,
    <code>REG_EXPAND_SZ</code>) value <code>StubPath</code>,
    <code>REG_SZ</code> value <code>ComponentID</code> and
    <code>REG_DWORD</code> value <code>IsInstalled</code> set to
    <code>1</code>. When the Active Setup is performed the
    <code>StubPath</code> is run.</p>

    <p>Creating the GUID and adding the keys is another bit of <a
    href="add_jit_program.vbs">VBScript</a>. Because I'd like the
    install to give the user the option of restricting the users
    access to the system, the registry edits are divided into a
    personalized set for each language (<a
    href="english_student.reg">english</a>, <a
    href="french_student.reg">français</a> and <a
    href="arabic_student.reg">أربيك</a>). Then there is a <a
    href="lockdown.reg">general set</a> to control the user's
    access.</p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p>I don't want for this process to be too restricted to my idea
    of the setup that I am doing. I would like to give the users some
    degree of control with a minimum of effort. At the same time this
    is my last project, my chef d'&#x276;uvre so to speak. I want for
    it to be pretty, because no matter for technically impressive a
    project, the users won't respect a thing without some
    prettiness.</p>

    <p>So, I want to go with a graphical installer to let the user
    pick what they'd like to install. This is run by the <a
    href="winnt.sif">automated install</a>, and to create it I think
    <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net"><acronym
    title="Nullsoft Superpimp Install System">NSIS</acronym></a> is a
    good choice.</p>

    <p>What is the difference between a GMC setup and a normal XP
    install? (I.e. what operations does the installer need to
    perform?</p>

    <p>In creating the installer I've got two goals:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>This setup could use a couple more pieces, but my time is
      short and this'll have to do. Adding new programs should require
      a minimum of effort and programming experience</li>
      <li>The programs for this install are obviously not going to go
      on a single CD. The target product will be a multi-CD set, but
      it should work if run over a network or from a single medium
      such as a DVD or flash drive</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The main problem I am having is unicode support. As before,
    there is no ISO character set that contains both Arabic and
    extended Latin characters. In the end the installer is in
    ISO-8859-1 and certain tasks, like <a
    href="create_arabic_student.vbs">creating the Arabic user
    account</a> are spawned out to UTF-16 VBScripts.</p>

    <p>The installer is broken into two main parts. <a
    href="postinstall.nsi">The main installer</a> handles the account
    creation and whatnot. It also includes the <a
    href="gmc_programs.nsi">programs list</a> which uses macros in an
    attempt to be as quick to update as possible.</p>

    <p>It was necessary to create a couple custom headers for the
    install as well:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="RadioButtons.nsh">RadioButtons</a>: A replacement
      for the existing RadioButtons implementation that correctly
      handles when RadioButtons are in a selectable group</li>
      <li><a href="RunProgram.nsh">RunProgram</a>: Used to deal with
      the multiple CD setup. It searches for a program on the local
      drives and also in <code>$INSTDIR</code> and
      <code>$EXEDIR</code> before prompting the user to insert a
      CD</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Branding</h2>

    <p>To take a break and play with art for a bit, I made a 150x57
    pixel <a href="gad%20header.bmp">header image</a> in <a
    href="gad%20header.ai">Illustrator</a>.</p>

    <h2>Rosetta Stone</h2>

    <p>As long as I am creating installers, I ought to do one for the
    Rosetta Stone software. The copy that I have can run without a CD,
    but it has to be installed in a certain way. Also, the files for
    the French and English are over 900mb and I am hoping that
    creating an installer will compress them to under 700mb so I can
    but them on a single CD.</p>

    <p>It takes about 30 minutes to run, but <a
    href="rosetta_stone.nsi">NSIS</a> manages to make an installer
    that's around 600mb. It also needs a <a
    href="rosetta_stone.cmd">command file</a> to <code>subst</code>
    a drive before starting the program.</p>

    <h2>Tap'Touche</h2>

    <p>This is an InstallShield installer, but the
    <code>setup.iss</code> file was already created. I had to make a
    <a href="tap'touche%20unattended%20install.cmd">command file</a>
    to kill the copy of notepad that's spawned at the end.</p>

    <h2>Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing</h2>
    
    <p>Also an InstallShield installer, this one needed a
    <code>setup.iss</code> created with <code>setup -R</code>. Also it
    needed a <a
    href="mavis%20beacon%20unattended%20install.cmd">command file</a>
    to kill the registration program and remove some unwanted
    shortcuts. Actually, I remove all the shortcuts because the
    program that's started is an unnecessary menu and recreate it in
    the <a href="gmc_programs.nsi"><acronym 
    title="Nullsoft Superpimp Install System">NSIS</acronym>
    config</a>.</p>

    <h2>Encarta Encyclopédie</h2>

    <p>The basic install is easy enough. The installer is a <acronym
    title="Microsoft Installer">MSI</acronym>, so adding the
    <code>/qb-</code> switch automates it. The problem is that the
    data files aren't copied over, so that has to be done manually. I
    added that section to the <a href="gmc_programs.nsi"><acronym
    title="Nullsoft Superpimp Install System">NSIS</acronym>
    config</a> and added a registry key as well.</p>

    <h2>Office 2003 Français</h2>

    <p>This setup was a little different. I downloaded <a
    href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/OfficeXPProf/Install/10.0.4601.0/W982KMeXP/EN-US/orktools.exe">Office
    XP's resource kit</a> which includes a wizard for creating
    Microsoft installer transforms (MSTs). Using this I made a <a
    href="gmc_office_2003.mst">mst</a> which takes out Outlook,
    InfoPath and Publisher, and adds in some of the French and Arabic
    bits.</p>

    <h2>Adobe Programs</h2>

    <p>Photoshop, PageMaker, Premier, Illustrator, Distiller are all
    InstallShield, so all it took was creating <code>setup.iss</code>
    files.</p>

    <h2>IrfanView</h2>

    <p>IrfanView was an interesting one. The installer seems to be
    custom GUI code and I couldn't get it to install unattended for
    the life of me. For this one I wrote a <a
    href="sendkeys.vbs">script</a> to pass keystrokes into a
    program.</p>

    <h2>Celestia</h2>

    <p>Celestia is InnoSetup, but there is a little custom prompt at
    the beginning that isn't handled either by <code>/silent</code> or
    <code>/verysilent</code>. The <a href="sendkeys.vbs">keysending
    script</a> is used to get rid of that and from there it runs
    fine.</p>
