    <h1>Templating Use Case Scenarios</h1>

    <p>In looking at templating, there are several common situations that make up 90% of the problems I expect to see. I want to make sure that I handle them well.</p>

    <h2>Common Container</h2>

    <p>Lots of sites have a common header and sidebars that are included on all the pages. If you look at <a href="http://mpp.org">MPP's site</a>, the header and side columns are the same across the site.</p>

    <p>I want to be able to specify a default container at the base of a file hierarchy and have it propogate up. As to have the container will be specified, each directory will have metadata and that will allow the specification of information like defaults.</p>

    <h2>Adding a Stylesheet</h2>

    <p>I'll have a content document, which will need something like a custom width on the body or a different background color. To do this properly, I need to include a new stylesheet link in the header. Specifying a transformation like that is done with various hooks in most systems.</p>

    <p>I like the hooks system because it is flexible. What I was thinking is I would prep the output document in memory and let hooks modify that. Maybe expose the document to the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/">BSF</a> and <a href="http://dsd.lbl.gov/nux/">xQuery</a>.</p>
