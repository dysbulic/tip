    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>If you'd like to "change the climate" around marijuana to keep your kids safe from hard drugs, to save thousands of your tax dollars, and to stop the senseless arrest of millions, then <a href="supportus/">support Change the Climate</a>.</p>
    <p>It's a campaign, founded by parents and business professionals, to educate the public about the tremendous waste of our tax dollars for the "war on marijuana" and the increasing threat to our basic civil liberties. Our goal is to tell the truth about marijuana &mdash; to de-demonize it &mdash; so that someday, politicians will support marijuana reform legislation. <a href="supportus/">Support us</a> now and help us tell the truth.</p>
    <p>Like other drugs, marijuana is <strong>not</strong> for kids. But providing inaccurate information about marijuana in the form of "shock ads" only discredits adults and our efforts to curb marijuana use by young people. We have <a href="kids/">ideas on how to talk to your kids about marijuana</a>.</p>
    <p>Change the Climate's advertising campaign is an effective way to change attitudes and bring marijuana reform directly to the people &mdash; billboards and banner ads reach different people than NY Times and New Republic ads. Politicians will <strong>not</strong> make any effort to change unjust, wasteful and unconstitutional marijuana laws until it's clear that people are fed up with these laws. Since 1996, medical marijuana initiatives have been passed by a majority of voters in eight states and the District of Columbia &mdash; and no state has ever rejected a medical marijuana initiative. Currently, one in five voters in the U.S. lives in a state where marijuana is legal for medicinal purposes.</p>
