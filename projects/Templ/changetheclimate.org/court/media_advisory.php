  </b> Moakley Federal Courthouse, Boston -- District Judge Keeton's courtroom 
  (#3)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><br>
  <b>WHO:</b><br>
  Change the Climate, a Greenfield, Massachusetts based non-profit organization, 
  which has already run similar advertisements on the Washington, D.C. Metro and 
  on the multi-campus website dailyjolt.com.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> The American Civil Liberties 
  Union is representing Change the Climate. Noted attorney Harvey Schwartz will 
  argue the case.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><br>
  <b>WHY:</b><br>
  The MBTA has lost several previous lawsuits challenging its legal right to determine 
  the political content of ads which can be displayed on its property. This case, 
  the first to go to trial in federal court, will set a precedent for future advertising 
  on the bus, subway and streetcar system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Change the Climate was 
  founded by parents and business professionals to educate the public about the 
  costs of the &quot;war on marijuana.&quot; The campaign uses billboards and 
  other forms of mass advertising to deliver graphic messages designed to &quot;de-demonize&quot; 
  private marijuana use by adults. </font></p>
