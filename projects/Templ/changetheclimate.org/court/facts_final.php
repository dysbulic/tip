  Inc.'s Statement of Uncontested Facts</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>A. The Parties.</b><br>
  Change the Climate ("CTC") is a not for profit organization which, 
  quite literally, seeks to "change the climate" around the discussion 
  of marijuana issues in the United States. Joe White, Executive Director of CTC, 
  founded the organization in 1999, as a concerned parent and citizen, for the 
  purpose of raising public awareness about marijuana issues, including the inordinate 
  amount of tax dollars spent on marijuana law enforcement and the potential harm 
  to our children resulting from arrest and incarceration. (Affidavit of Joseph 
  White ("White Aff."), 2, attached as Exhibit 1; Deposition of Joe 
  White ("White Dep."), pp. 26-27, 148-149, attached as Exhibit 2.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">CTC's mission is to stimulate 
  debate about marijuana issues. Among its many concerns, CTC seeks to promote 
  discussion about the negative consequences of the marijuana laws on our children, 
  the extraordinary resources our government has devoted to marijuana law enforcement, 
  the differences between marijuana and other drugs such as heroin and cocaine, 
  and the proven beneficial medical and industrial uses of marijuana.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> (White 
  Aff., 3; White Dep., pp. 37-39, 148-49, 157-58, 168-70.) By engaging the public 
  in discussion on marijuana issues, and attempting to combat misinformation with 
  accurate information, CTC hopes to help reduce the level of hysteria that has 
  so long dominated the public domain about marijuana. Toward that end, as Executive 
  Director, White created and operates an interactive web site, www.changetheclimate.org. 
  (White Aff., 3-4.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">One way CTC seeks to 
  raise public awareness is through its media campaign. CTC embarked on a national 
  advertising campaign in an effort to stimulate public debate through provocative 
  advertisements on public transit systems throughout the nation's cities. (White 
  Dep., pp. 23-26; White Aff. 5.) The media campaign intends to raise questions 
  in people's minds about the broad issues of marijuana policy. (White Dep., pp. 
  28-30, 37-39, 67.) CTC chose the medium of public transit systems because it 
  reaches the most number of people and is a proven vehicle to attract attention, 
  to stimulate debate, and to raise issues in the public domain. (White Dep., 
  pp. 23, 41.) Three advertisements used in CTC's campaign - one of which has 
  already been successfully displayed on transit buses in our nation's capital 
  - are the subject of this lawsuit. Copies of these proposed advertisements are 
  attached as Exhibit B. (See also White Aff., 12.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">While CTC hopes to raise 
  ideas and questions in peoples' minds about the efficacy of our current marijuana 
  laws and policies through its provocative advertisements, in no way does the 
  organization advocate the use of marijuana or any violation of existing laws. 
  (White Aff., 5.) Woven throughout CTC's promotional materials, the interactive 
  web site, and its media campaign are explicit messages that the truth need be 
  spoken about marijuana and that marijuana is not for kids. (White Aff., 6; White 
  Dep., pp. 40, 151-156, 161, 168.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The defendant Massachusetts 
  Bay Transportation Authority ("MBTA") is a body politic and political 
  subdivision of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. By statute, it is expressly 
  authorized to "sell, lease or otherwise contract for advertising in or 
  on the facilities of the authority." Mass.Gen.L. ch. 161A, §§ 
  2 and 3 (1993). During all times relevant to this action, the MBTA regularly 
  authorized its exclusive advertising agent, Park Transit Display, Inc. ("PTD"), 
  to post commercial and noncommercial advertisements, including advertisements 
  expressing social, political and religious messages, in MBTA facilities, and 
  on MBTA buses and trains (Deposition of Lucy V. Shorter ("Shorter Dep."), 
  pp. 20, 80, attached as Exhibit 3; White Dep., p. 86.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The defendant Robert 
  Prince is the General Manager of the MBTA and is its Chief Executive Officer. 
  He has occupied that position since 1997. (Deposition of Robert H. Prince, Jr. 
  ("Prince Dep."), p. 6, attached as Exhibit 4.) Prince's self-described 
  role in advertising decisions is that he provides ultimate approval or disapproval 
  of an advertisement when an advertisement is called into question. (Prince Dep., 
  p. 5.) Prince's approval is not required for all proposed advertisements submitted 
  for display. (Id. at 49.) Based on the discretionary decisions of his staff, 
  his approval is only required when there are questions about the acceptability 
  of a proposed advertisement, at which time he considers the proposed ad, the 
  recommendation of his staff, and, some times but not others, the MBTA guidelines, 
  to give him some latitude in rendering a decision. (Prince Dep., pp. 16, 49 
  -51.) An internal sign-off sheet would reflect his decision. A copy of this 
  sign-off sheet is attached as Exhibit C; see also Shorter Dep., p. 9.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The defendant Lucy Shorter 
  was employed by the MBTA for more than twenty years, and was the Director of 
  Marketing Communications in the Marketing Department from 1992 to November 2000. 
  (Shorter Dep., p. 5.) The Marketing department was the exclusive department 
  that dealt with proposed advertisements for display on MBTA facilities and vehicles. 
  (Id. at 6, 18-22.) An advertiser could not deal directly with the Marketing 
  Department, however. At all times relevant to this action, all advertising placement 
  had to go through PTD. (Id. at p. 80.) Elissa Albertelli, National Sales Manager 
  of PTD, was Shorter's exclusive agent for that process. (Deposition of Elissa 
  Albertelli ("Albertelli Dep."), p. 8, attached as Exhibit 5.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Shorter was directly 
  responsible for the MBTA's decision to reject the plaintiff's proposed ads based 
  on her perception of the viewpoint of the ads, and her perception that Change 
  the Climate's mission conflicted with the MBTA's advertising policies. A copy 
  of Shorter's January 20, 2000 fax to Albertelli, stating the reasons for her 
  decision, is attached as Exhibit D.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>B. The Promotion of 
  Discussion and Debate Our Nation's Failed Drug Policies Is An Important Matter 
  of Public Concern. </b><br>
  <br>
  To survey what has been written and spoken on the vast subject of our nation's 
  war on drugs over the years is a task well beyond the scope of this case. What 
  is material is that increasingly, respected public figures are urgently calling 
  for citizens to do exactly what Change the Climate, through its media campaign, 
  is trying to do: get people to think about and debate rational alternatives 
  to our failed war on drugs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">An excerpt from Chief 
  Judge Torruella's thoughtful article, The"War on Drugs": One Judge's 
  Attempt At A Rational Discussion, bears on this point directly:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Drug enforcement policy 
  involves the consideration of issues as diverse as international and national 
  politics, law enforcement, sociology, economics, organizational dynamics, and 
  penology, to mention only the most salient. In addition, there are complex scientific, 
  pharmacological and health questions, and, of course, moral quandaries, raised 
  by the various policy choices and alternatives. Nevertheless, I do not think 
  that the complexity of the subject should deter us from exchanging views, for 
  we must start at some point, and now is as good a time as any. In fact, I believe 
  that more vigorous and frank public discussion of these issues is what is presently 
  needed.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Veteran Judge, former 
  federal prosecutor and Navy JAG criminal defense attorney, James P. Gray, recently 
  authored the new book, Why Our Drug Laws Have Failed And What We Can Do About 
  It, in which he echoes Judge Torruella's sentiment:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The real problem in this 
  area actually is not the drugs themselves. The real problem is that our citizens 
  and our leaders simply will not look at the evidence, even though it is all 
  around us. Our present policy is exacerbating the problems and will not stand 
  up to scrutiny. What we really need to do is to open the subject to rigorous 
  public debate. This is our best and perhaps our only hope for moving forward 
  to a better strategy, and to adopting programs that will actually work. The 
  advocates of the status quo stand firmly against any full or open discussion 
  of federal drug policy, but what we really need to do is explore our options 
  realistically, and tell each other the truth.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Numerous other lawyers 
  and judges have expressed those same concerns in "An Open Letter from Judges 
  and Attorneys," sponsored by the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers, Inc.:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">. . . . [W]e join with 
  our colleagues in calling upon our profession, elected officials, the media 
  and the public to initiate a truly open and honest evaluation of the efficacy 
  and consequences of our drug control laws. Only a public debate guided by mutual 
  respect can yield better drug laws in which fear, prejudice and punitive prohibitions 
  yield to common sense, science, public health and human rights. As America we 
  must never "surrender" to drugs, neither must she surrender to inertia 
  or fear that shuts off debate, suppresses critical analysis, dismisses alternatives 
  to current policies, and vilifies those who express dissenting views.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The citations could go 
  on and on and on, from speakers in the legal community to speakers in the scientific 
  and medical community throughout society. The salient point, for the purposes 
  of this litigation, is that the promotion of public discussion and debate on 
  the subject of our nation's drug polices, and the efficacy of those policies, 
  is a matter of important public concern unto itself.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>C. MBTA's Advertising 
  Space.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Pursuant to its statutory 
  grant of authority, the MBTA sells advertising space on MBTA subway cars, platforms, 
  and buses for the display of commercial and noncommercial messages, including 
  social and political public interest messages of advocacy organizations. Shorter 
  testified to this fact directly at her deposition:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> Does 
  the T have any policy under which it will not sell advertising to an advocacy 
  organization?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Objection to form.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Answer:</b> They're 
  not policies. They're guidelines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> By advocacy 
  organization, I mean an organization that promotes a political or social viewpoint 
  for or against an issue, for or against abortion, for or against animal rights, 
  for or against littering. Does the T have a guideline under which it will not 
  sell advertising space to such advocacy groups?</font></p>

  You're talking about while she was employed there?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> Yes,

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Answer:</b> No.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> And, 
  in fact, the T regularly makes its advertising space available to advocacy groups

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Answer:</b> It's a 
  public service.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> What

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Answer:</b> Yes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Shorter Dep., pp. 64-65). 
  <br>
  Indeed, the MBTA makes its advertising space available to anybody who is willing 
  to pay for the space and who provides an advertisement that meets the MBTA's 
  advertising guidelines. Shorter, Prince and Albertelli all testified accordingly. 
  For example, Shorter testified:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> Are 
  you aware of the T ever rejecting an ad that complied with the guidelines?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Objection.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Answer:</b> I don't 
  recall any.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> So is 
  it fair to say that anybody who wanted to purchase or to place ads on T facilities 
  could do so long as they paid the price and as long as their ads complied with 
  the guidelines?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Answer:</b> Working 
  through the contractor, yes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Shorter Dep., pp. 64-67.) 
  Prince similarly testified: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> Does 
  the T makes its advertising space available to anybody who is willing to pay 
  for it and provide an ad that meets all of the guidelines?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Answer:</b> Yes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Prince Dep., pp. 46-47.) 
  And Albertelli's testimony followed suit: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> In your 
  dealings with the MBTA, was there ever a time when the MBTA refused to provide 
  advertising space for an advertisement that complied with its guidelines?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Objection.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Answer:</b> I would 
  think not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Albertelli Dep., p. 
  46.) <br>
  At all times relevant to this action, including the present, among the commercial 
  advertisements that have been and continue to be on display are those for alcohol 
  products. (Shorter Dep., p. 68, Albertelli Dep., p. 15.) Noncommercial advertisements 
  on display have included and continue to include public interest messages ranging 
  from religious messages to political and social messages reflecting viewpoints 
  on important matters of public concern. For example, the MBTA has displayed 
  and continues to display messages concerning abortion services, the protection 
  of animals against inhumane treatment, domestic violence victim services, child 
  support collection, AIDS awareness and prevention, and drug awareness and prevention. 
  (Affidavit of Lisa Aunkst ("Aunkst Aff."), 4-9, attached as Exhibit 
  6; Affidavit of Lillian Hirales ("Hirales Aff."), 2-3, attached as 
  Exhibit 7). Such issues are, of course, properly understood as important social 
  and political issues of our time.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> (Prince Dep., pp. 41-45.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The only product the 
  MBTA categorically prohibits in its advertising policies is tobacco. (Shorter 
  Dep., p. 68.) Despite the existence of this express restriction, advertisements 
  reflecting the use, even the glamorization of what appear to be tobacco products 
  are being displayed prominently on MBTA property as this brief is being written. 
  (Aunkst Aff., 9.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>D. MBTA's Public Record 
  of Unconstitutional Viewpoint Discrimination.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In three reported cases 
  brought in this district concerning its advertising practices, the MBTA was 
  found to have impermissibly discriminated against non-profit advertisers on 
  the basis of the viewpoint of the message in the advertisements. See AIDS Action 
  Committee of Massachusetts v. MBTA, 42 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1994), affirming and 
  modifying 849 F. Supp. 79 (D.Mass. 1993) (attached to Plaintiff's Memorandum 
  of Law as Exhibit 1a); Citizens to End Animal Suffering and Exploitation v. 
  MBTA, C.A. No. 92-11118-MA (D.Mass. June 5, 1992) (attached as Exhibit 1b); 
  Preterm, Inc. v. MBTA, C.A. No. 74-159-MA,1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8555 (D.Mass. 
  May 13, 1974) (attached as Exhibit 1c). In each of these cases, the MBTA was 
  ordered to display the messages and refrain from so discriminating in the future. 
  See AIDS Action, 42 F.3d at 38-40 (enjoining viewpoint discrimination and ordering 
  MBTA to post safe sex practices advertisements); Citizens to End Animal Suffering, 
  C.A. No. 92-11118-MA (ordering MBTA to post animal rights advertising placard); 
  Preterm, C.A. No. 74-159-M,1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8555, at * 6 (granting preliminary 
  injunction and ordering display of ads concerning abortion services available 
  at clinic). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Shorter was the Director 
  of Marketing and Communications of the MBTA in 1994, when the First Circuit 
  affirmed the district court injunction in AIDS Action. Despite the outcome in 
  that case, Shorter testified that she never received any training whatsoever 
  to prevent future violations of advertisers' First Amendment rights by MBTA 
  officials. (Shorter Dep., pp. 16-17.) Despite this record of unconstitutional 
  conduct, the MBTA did not distribute a single memorandum to educate employees 
  in the aftermath of any of these decisions.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> Despite this record of unconstitutional 
  conduct, Defendant Prince, the General Manager and CEO of the MBTA, testified 
  that if, in his judgment, a political opinion is "harmful to juveniles," 
  he could decline to run an advertisement on that basis. (Prince Dep., p. 41.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>E. MBTA's Advertising 
  Approval Process. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">At all times relevant 
  to this action, the Marketing Department was the exclusive department that dealt 
  with proposed advertisements for display on MBTA facilities and vehicles. (Shorter 
  Dep., p. 5) Defendant Shorter was the point person from the Department with 
  whom PTD, the MBTA's exclusive advertising agent, dealt in the advertising process. 
  (Albertelli Dep., p. 7.) When a business wanted to buy advertising space on 
  the MBTA, it did not have the option of dealing with the MBTA directly. It had 
  to go through PTD. (Albertelli Dep., p. 8.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In her capacity as Director 
  of Marketing Communications, Shorter reviewed ads that came in from PTD and 
  forwarded ads for final approval by the General Manager, who was at all times 
  relevant, defendant Robert Prince. (Shorter Dep., p. 6, 13; Prince Dep., p. 
  5; Albertelli Dep., p. 25.) Shorter created a sign-off sheet for advertisements 
  that she would review, to be sent for approval by Prince. (Shorter Dep., pp. 
  9-11.) Albertelli was never privy to this process or sheet. (Albertelli Dep., 
  p. 24.) The procedure would be used when PTD was unsure whether a submitted 
  ad fell within the MBTA guidelines. (Id. at 13-14.) Once she submitted an ad 
  to Shorter, Albertelli would await an answer. (Albertelli Dep., p. 28.) Shorter 
  testified that ninety-nine percent of the time, however, PTD would post the 
  ad without seeking approval. (Shorter Dep., at 14.) Albertelli agreed. It was 
  left to PTD's discretion whether the Marketing Department would need to see 
  the ads in the first instance. (Albertelli Dep., pp. 12-14.) Albertelli's guiding 
  criterion in determining whether to bring an ad to the MBTA's attention was 
  whether the ad was "a little bit provocative." (Id. at p. 15.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Albertelli also testified 
  that when there was an ad copy in question, she and Shorter would discuss it, 
  bring in the client at some point, and talk to him or her about the campaign 
  and any objections raised by Shorter. (Albertelli Dep., p. 48.) Neither Albertelli 
  nor Shorter ever invited White in to discuss objections to the plaintiff's ads. 
  (Albertelli Dep., p. 33.)<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>F. Change The Climate's 
  Submission of Ads for Approval to the MBTA. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In September 1998, White 
  contacted Albertelli at PTD to request information about the process for placement 
  of advertisements on the transit authority's public advertising space. (White 
  Dep., pp. 65, 108) Subsequently, Albertelli mailed a standard media kit to White, 
  explaining advertising rates, demographic information, and population statistics 
  on advertising coverage. (Albertelli Dep., p. 16; White Dep., p. 65) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In the spring of 1999, 
  through a series of phone calls, White and Albertelli arranged a meeting in 
  Cambridge to discuss a paid public service campaign for CTC. (Albertelli Dep., 
  p. 17; White Dep., p. 68.) In telephone conversations and a meeting that took 
  place at the Charles River Hotel on or about May 10, 1999, White explained to 
  Albertelli that CTC wanted to get a message out in general around the subject 
  of marijuana. (Albertelli Dep., p. 20; White Dep., pp., 85-86.) Albertelli recalls 
  that White told her that CTC was looking to educate the public and raise public 
  awareness on various issues surrounding marijuana and that she received for 
  her review CTC materials, including some draft ads, early on in her dealings 
  with White (Albertelli Dep., pp. 17, 40; White Dep., p. 85).<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> During the course of 
  their conversations, Albertelli explained to White that the process between 
  PTD and the MBTA for getting advertisements approved was that samples of the 
  "creative" (i.e. proposed copy of the ads) would first be sent to 
  Shorter, and upon receiving a response from Shorter, a formal application would 
  be made on his behalf. (White Dep., pp. 85, p. 112-13) White recorded the substance 
  of one of these conversations with Albertelli in his day planner. One entry 
  reads "she needs to run creative by MBTA." Copies of White's day planner 
  entries of May 1999 are attached as Exhibit G. (See also White. Dep., pp. 112-13) 
  Also during the course of their conversations, White recalls Albertelli telling 
  him words to the effect that she didn't think that Shorter would have a problem 
  with the mild content of the ads that CTC was proposing to display.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> (White 
  Dep., p. 86.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">On May 11, 1999, Albertelli 
  sent White proposals for media buys of varying monetary amounts from PTD, as 
  well as additional information on advertising demographics and bus geographic 
  coverage. (Albertelli Dep., p. 17.) Upon receiving the proposals, White sent 
  Albertelli several proposed ads that he wished the MBTA to consider. A copy 
  of a handwritten undated note to Albertelli from White, attaching several draft 
  ads is attached as Exhibit H. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">On May 21, 1999, at Albertelli's 
  direction, White sent Shorter additional information about Change the Climate, 
  so that she could learn more about the organization. Among other things, the 
  information describes CTC's media campaign and the emphasis CTC places on its 
  position that marijuana is not for kids. A copy of the May 21, 1999 letter to 
  Shorter from White is attached as Exhibit I. Shorter received the packet and 
  reviewed that information, as well as the proposed ads that White had sent to 
  Albertelli. (Shorter Dep., p. 54.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">From May through December 
  1999, White called Albertelli on several occasions, inquiring about the MBTA's 
  response to the advertising copy and other materials that he had mailed to both 
  Albertelli and the MBTA, and how to complete the process and get the ads up 
  and running. (White Dep., pp. 88, 90-91, 120-121.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">After more weeks of waiting 
  and hearing nothing back, on January 3, 2000, White contacted Albertelli again 
  and expressed his frustration with the MBTA's delay in responding to the creative 
  sent months prior. (White Dep., p. 122.) Albertelli told White at that point 
  that she would submit a formal application to get a response. (White Dep., p. 
  123.) The next day, White followed up that phone call with a letter to Albertelli, 
  enclosing the materials that she had indicated were the materials necessary 
  for the application.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> These materials included

  of Change the Climate's Proposed Ads.</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">On January 24, 2000, 
  Albertelli informed White that the MBTA had rejected Change the Climate's proposed 
  advertisements. In a cover letter she faxed to White she wrote: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Regretfully, I've attached 
  the response from the Transit Authority regarding "Change the Climate" 
  campaign. Their reasons for not accepting this campaign are clearly stated in 
  the info. provided.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(emphasis added). Copies 
  of the cover letter from Albertelli to White, dated January 24, 2000, and the 
  attachments from Shorter that she forwarded along with that cover letter, are 
  attached as Exhibits K-M (See also Albertelli Dep., p. 29.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The "attached response" 
  to which Albertelli referred was a copy of a fax cover sheet that Shorter sent 
  to her a few days prior, on January 20, 2000, (Ex. D), in which Shorter stated:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">See attached. The Change 
  the Climate promotes the use of marijuana in a suttle [sic] way and also is 
  really a reform marijuana [sic] in a effort to legalize? The T's appearance 
  & character, Policy & Drug - Alcohol policy is in conflict with their 
  mission.<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Id.; see also Exhibit 
  L.) Shorter attached the two MBTA policies, i.e. the "appearance and character, 
  Policy" and the "Drug - Alcohol Policy" she referenced in the 
  memo, indicating with an asterisk in the margins of each paragraph the excerpt 
  that she believed applied to Change the Climate's proposed advertisements. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The first excerpt that 
  Shorter placed as asterisk beside provides:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">ARTICLE VII - APPEARANCE 
  AND CHARACTER OF ADVERTISEMENTS<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">All advertisements 
  at any time inserted or placed by the Contractor in or upon any locations or 
  display devices shall be of a reputable character, and the appearance of all 
  advertisements shall be acceptable to and in accordance with the Massachusetts 
  Bay Transportation Authority's standards for character and appearance of advertisements. 
  No libelous, slanderous, or obscene advertisements may be accepted by the Contractor 
  for display in or upon the Authority's transit facilities. The MBTA will not 
  accept advertisements containing violent criminal content, firearms, profane 
  content, promotional materials that is [sic] harmful to juveniles, and advertisements 
  that denigrate groups based on gender, religion, race, ethnic or political affiliation 
  for display in or upon the Authority's transit facilities. Advertisements shall 
  be submitted in advance to the Authority for review at the Authority's request 
  or whenever the Contractor reasonably believes such advertisements may be objectionable 
  within the meaning of this ARTICLE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">This excerpt is from 
  a section entitled "Section 3- Transit Advertising Contract Terms and Conditions." 
  (See Exhibit M.) While the fact that Shorter attached this document to her January 
  2000 fax to Albertelli would suggest that it was an excerpt from a section of 
  the existing contract between Park Transit Display and the MBTA, it is not. 
  At their respective depositions, Shorter and Prince each identified this document 
  as an excerpt from the1999 bid specifications for a contract that was ultimately 
  entered into between the MBTA and Transit Display Incorporated ("TDI"), 
  PTD's successor, on May 30, 2000. These specifications were not for any existing 
  contract between the MBTA and PTD, but rather, had an effective date of July 
  1, 2000 - six months after the plaintiff's ads were rejected. (Shorter Dep., 
  pp. 22-23, 27-28, 39; Prince Dep., pp. 6-7, 9-10, 12-13.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Shorter testified that 
  while no one told her when the updated version of the guidelines was to go into 
  effect, she decided to apply them anyway to her review of CTC's ads and send 
  them to Albertelli as an explanation for her decision to reject them. (Shorter 
  Dep., p. 27.) To Shorter, the various policies she had accessible to her "were 
  all just one in the same" so she "applied whatever we had." (Id.) 
  As for Albertelli, she testified that she would not think of looking at the 
  guidelines before making a determination as to whether or not to forward them 
  to Shorter for review. Rather, she would use her personal judgment as to whether 
  a particular ad struck her as provocative and forward it to Shorter accordingly, 
  for her "objective" review. (Albertelli Dep., pp. 15, 37, 42.) And 
  as for Prince, while he claimed to be familiar with the specifications, he gave 
  contradictory and unreliable testimony throughout questioning on this document.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In a vain attempt to 
  reconcile these conflicting facts, both Prince and Shorter testified that the 
  MBTA had updated 1992 specifications for the contract between the MBTA and PTD 
  prior to the creation of the 1999 specifications, and that these updated guidelines 
  were simply reflected in Article VII of the 1999 contract between the MBTA and 
  TDI. (Prince Dep., pp. 11; Shorter Dep., p. 24.) Shorter went so far as to say 
  that PTD was always informed of the updated guidelines changes. (Shorter Dep., 
  p. 23.) Yet when pressed with the question of just when and how PTD was informed 
  of these purported updates and revisions, she ultimately admitted that there 
  was nothing in writing notifying PTD of any updated guidelines whatsoever. Indeed, 
  she ultimately admitted that the first time she could recall informing PTD of 
  the updated guidelines just happened to be in her January 2000 fax to Elissa 
  Albertelli rejecting CTC's proposed ads. (Ex. I; Shorter Dep., pp. 24-25.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In other words, it is 
  undisputed that Article VII of the 1999 bid specifications (and hence the other 
  three policies that Shorter attached to her fax, which are all undisputably 
  part of the same bid specifications), were not even in effect as of January 
  2000, when Shorter sent them to PTD to explain her rejection of the plaintiff's 
  ads. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The second excerpt that 
  Shorter placed an asterisk beside provided: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Drug and Alcohol Free 
  Workplace Requirement:<br>
  All contractors, contractors' employees and vendors are to be free of the effect 
  of drugs, alcohol, controlled substances, or other prohibitive substances, when 
  they are on MBTA property or performing MBTA business. In addition, all referenced 
  parties are prohibited from using, possessing, selling or distributing any drugs, 
  alcohol, controlled substances, or other prohibited substances, when they are 
  on MBTA property or performing MBTA business.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(See Exhibit N.) Unlike 
  the first excerpt from "Section 3," this excerpt was taken from "Section 
  2 - Instruction to Bidders." Notwithstanding the asterisk placed in the 
  margin by Shorter, it is undisputed that this excerpt is applicable, on its 
  face, to contract bidders only - i.e. those who bid on contracts with the MBTA 
  to sell advertising space. Nothing in this workplace policy has any relevance 
  whatsoever to Change the Climate's proposed ads, or any potential advertisers 
  for that matter.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">While specifically referring 
  to just the two policies above in her fax to Albertelli, Shorter also attached 
  two additional policies that have no relevance whatsoever to the plaintiff's 
  ads for good measure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">This time bearing a question 
  mark by Shorter in the margin, the first is an excerpt from Section 3 of the 
  1999 bid specifications that applies, on its face, to tobacco products only. 
  It reads: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Article VIII - ADVERTISEMENTS 
  FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS<br>
  The Contractor shall not display or accept for display advertisements for tobacco 
  products in or upon any locations or display devices within the Authority's 
  transit facilities. This prohibition of advertisements for tobacco products 
  shall be in effect for the entire contract term.<br>
  <br>
  (See Exhibit O.) The final attachment bears no mark by Shorter at all. Like 
  the "Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace Requirement," this page is an 
  excerpt from Section 2 of the 1999 bid specifications which, again, have absolutely 
  no application to Change the Climate's proposed ads or advertisers generally. 
  A plain reading of each of the paragraphs in this document indicates that these 
  provisions, like the "Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace Requirement" 
  provisions above are relevant to bidders only, as the title "INSTRUCTION 
  TO BIDDERS" at the top of the document makes abundantly clear. (See Exhibit 
  P.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">After White received 
  Albertelli's fax, attaching the above documents, he called Albertelli to express 
  his disappointment. He told Albertelli that the MBTA had made inaccurate observations 
  about CTC as an organization, and mischaracterized CTC's advertising campaign. 
  (White Dep., pp. 130, 136.) White recalls that Albertelli seemed surprised herself 
  at the MBTA's response. (Id. at 129.) White told Albertelli he did not know 
  what CTC could do, and Albertelli made no mention of any appeal process. (Id. 
  at 132.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Other than the four sheets 
  attached to the Shorter fax, the MBTA never claimed any other policies were 
  relevant to Shorter's decision to reject Change the Climate's ads prior to the 
  instant litigation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">As recently as a January 
  2001 interview on WBOQ radio in Boston, Lydia Rivera, the MBTA Spokesperson 
  in the Press Office of the MBTA at all times relevant to this action,15 freely 
  acknowledged the reasons that the MBTA decided to reject the plaintiff's ads, 
  citing some of the same reasons as Shorter did in her fax, which indisputably 
  amount to the MBTA's hostility toward the plaintiff's viewpoint, as well as 
  offering some other insights into the MBTA's decision-making processes: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">on the reason for 
    the MBTA's rejection of the ads:<br>
    <br>
    "We came to the conclusion that we rejected the ads because, uh, they 
    promote the use of illegal and harmful substances . . . . We believe the ads, 
    you know, read as encouraging juveniles, um, who maybe, you know, particularly 
    susceptible to the ads' message to<br>
    experiment with marijuana."<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> on whether permitting 
    ads for alcoholic beverages to be displayed on MBTA property would be rejected 
    under the same criteria as allegedly applied to Change the Climate's ads, 
    that it promotes substances harmful to juveniles:<br>
    <br>
    "We don't believe so." <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">on the MBTA's reasons 
    for fighting the issue in court, in spite of the fact that the MBTA has already 
    been sued three times for alleged First Amendment violations and lost:<br>
    <br>
    "We stand firm on, basically, what we believe the MBTA should advertise 
    on our system, with regard to our obligation to society."<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">on the approach the 
    MBTA would take to a newly submitted ad campaign:<br>
    <br>
    "We would look at the material and see if it would work in our system 
    with regard to its content."<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> on who is involved 
    in the approval process for proposed ad campaigns: <br>
    <br>
    "Now, it wouldn't just be one person that would review the material and 
    make the decision, I mean we do have our marketing professionals, and then 
    we do have to deal with, let's just say the general manager, and the Secretary 
    of Transportation<br>
    and the board of directors."<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">on whether the MBTA 
    has a specific written policy regarding what kinds of advertisements it will 
    and will not accept or whether everything is handled on a case-by-case basis:<br>
    <br>
    "They are basically handled on a case-by-case basis."<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>H. MBTA Officials' 
  Discretion, Past and Present</b><br>
  While the MBTA rejected Change the Climate's proposed ads for the above reasons, 
  at all times relevant to this action, it has accepted and continues to accept 
  for display ads for the promotion of alcohol products, as well as ads containing 
  messages that promote points of view concerning drugs that MBTA officials consider 
  acceptable. (Prince Dep., pp. 44-45; Shorter Dep., pp. 68-69.) Attached as Exhibits 
  Q and R are copies of advertisements displayed by the MBTA, sponsored by the 
  Office of a National Drug Control Policy, one with the text: "Are You Waiting 
  for Your Kids to Talk to You About Pot?" and the second with the text: 
  "Just because you survived drugs, doesn't mean your children will." 
  For additional advertisements advocating similar messages, i.e. that parents 
  talk with their kids about drugs, from May 2000 to the present date, see Hirales 
  Aff., 2-3 and Aunkst Aff., 7. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In its answers to interrogatories, 
  the MBTA has asserted that it has rejected "a number of advertisements" 
  from January 1990 to May 2000. (Defendants Answers to Interrogatories, No. 5, 
  a copy of which is attached as Exhibit S.) Specifically, the defendants assert 
  that seventeen advertisements were rejected over the course of the ten-year 
  period, though when asked about several of these advertisements in deposition, 
  neither Shorter nor Prince could recall doing so; nor could either state just 
  how many of these ads violated MBTA policies. (Defs. Ans. to Ints. No. 5, at 
  Ex. S; Prince Dep., pp. 17-24.)<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Among the seventeen ads 
  that the MBTA lists as having been rejected is an advertisement for the film 
  "Fatal Instinct," which the defendants profess was either "rejected" 
  or "withdrawn by advertisers after MBTA raised initial objections" 
  because of "indecent content." (Defs. Ans. to Ints. No. 5, at Ex. 
  S.) It is a matter of public record, however, that the MBTA actually accepted 
  and ran two ads for the movie, both of which were reproduced as an exhibit in 
  the Appendix of the AIDS Action case. See AIDS Action, 43 F.3d at 5, 11 (rejecting 
  the MBTA's argument "that ad [sic] would never have been run if it had 
  been brought to the MBTA's attention in advance" as "unpersuasive" 
  and one that "by no means counter[ed] the impression of discrimination).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Also among the ads that 
  the MBTA lists is a "Party Smart" advertisement that the MBTA purportedly 
  rejected "because it contained graphic, violent and disturbing content, 
  in violation of the MBTA's advertising policy." A copy of this advertisement 
  is attached at Exhibit T, which, the plaintiff submits, is neither graphic nor 
  violent on its face. Rather, it is clearly a political advertisement that depicts 
  the very serious, known consequences of binge drinking: death.18 The rejection 
  of this anti-binge drinking ad was reported in The Boston Globe. Attached as 
  Exhibit U is a copy of The Boston Globe article, dated January 9, 1999. The 
  article notes that the rejected ad was part of a campaign launched by Mayor 
  Menino to depict heavy drinking as unglamorous, in response to the alcohol-related 
  deaths of two students in Massachusetts. Id. An MBTA spokeswoman was quoted 
  as saying "We told the city it was too graphic . . . We told them to tone 
  it down" and the article reported the MBTA standard for refusing ads was 
  that "if they're likely to offend a significant chunk of the T's readership, 
  they're rejected." Id. While the MBTA was aware of this article and received 
  a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts reminding 
  the MBTA of the Court's order in the AIDS Action case prohibiting the MBTA from 
  engaging in viewpoint discrimination, the General Counsel's office neither responded 
  to the letter nor posted the advertisement 19 Attached as Exhibit V is a copy 
  of the letter dated January 15, 1999 from the ACLU to the General Counsel's 
  office. All the while, the MBTA continued to display advertisements promoting 
  the consumption of alcohol. It is beyond dispute that underage drinking is a 
  serious problem and an important matter of social concern, even though Shorter 
  refused to acknowledge as much in her deposition. (Shorter Dep., pp. 68-69.) 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Of the remaining sixteen 
  ads, fifteen are commercial advertisements. According to the MBTA, the only 
  other noncommercial advertisement that it rejected over the ten year period 
  was one submitted by the nonprofit organization, NEAVS. A copy of this advertisement 
  is attached at Exhibit T, which, the plaintiff submits, neither depicts "violent 
  content" nor concerns the advocacy of "animal experimentation," 
  despite the MBTA's characterization of the advertisement. (Defs. Ans. to Ints. 
  No. 5, at Ex. S.) Rather, it is clearly a political advertisement advocating 
  to learn how to help stop the testing of drugs on animals. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>I. Post-hoc Justifications 
  for MBTA's Rejection of CTC's ads.</b></font></p>
<ol>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> After Change the 
    Climate filed suit, several advertising policies other than the one Shorter 
    actually attached to her January 2000 fax suddenly applied to Shorter's decision 
    to reject the proposed ads.</font></b></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">It was not until after 
  Change the Climate filed suit in May 2000 that the MBTA indicated that policies 
  other than the contract specifications that Shorter attached to the January 
  2000 fax may have applied to Shorter's decision to reject Change the Climate's 
  proposed advertisements. These indications, whether by MBTA counsel in answers 
  to interrogatories or by the individual witnesses in deposition, have been tentative 
  at best and anything but consistent. (Defs. Ans. to Ints. Nos. 4 and 9, at Ex. 
  S.)<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">For the first time, in 
  their answers to interrogatories and deposition testimony, the defendants claim 
  that a letter dated April 16, 1995, from Robert Mabardy, then Interim General 
  Manger of the MBTA to Michael Geden, then Vice President/General Manager, set 
  up new guidelines regarding advertising covered by the contract between the 
  MBTA and PTD in effect at the time CTC's ads were rejected. (Defs. Ans. to Ints. 
  No. 9, at Ex. S; Prince Dep., pp. 5-6; Shorter Dep., p. 19.) A copy of the April 
  16, 1995 "Mabardy letter" is attached as Exhibit W. These "MBTA 
  Advertising Guidelines" in that letter provide:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The MBTA will refuse 
  any advertisement that is indecent as to child viewers, or is of a nature to 
  frighten children, either emotionally or physically. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The following terms, 
  as used in these guidelines shall have the following meanings:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The terms "child" 
  or "children" shall mean any child under the age of seventeen years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The terms "indecent" 
  shall mean the exposure of children to language or pictures that describe or 
  depict sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner 
  as measured by contemporary community standards for the subway advertising medium.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The terms "frightening" 
  or "of a nature to frighten children, either emotionally or physically" 
  shall mean language or pictures that describe or depict violent or brutal activities, 
  or the end result of violent or brutal activities, whether such violence or 
  brutality was intended or not, in a manner which causes a child physical or 
  emotional distress or causes a child to fear for his personal safety or for 
  the safety or other persons or animals. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">At the end of the day, 
  this is the only document that Prince could be certain was in effect at the 
  time Change the Climate's proposed ads were submitted. (Prince Dep., pp. 6, 
  9-12.) It is undisputed that the plaintiff's proposed advertisements at issue 
  in this case are neither "indecent as to child viewers," nor "of 
  a nature to frighten children, either emotionally or physically" according 
  to the very language of the policy.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Thus, even if it were 
  in effect at the time, the Mabardy letter has no application to CTC's proposed 
  advertisements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Also in answers to interrogatories, 
  the defendants suggest for the first time that the "Commercial and Public 
  Service Advertising Policy, adopted in or about February 1993," might have 
  been in effect at the time of Shorter's decision. (Def. Ans. to Ints. No. 9, 
  at Ex. S.) A copy of the Commercial and Public Service Advertising Policy is 
  attached as Exhibit X. In deposition, however, Prince could not recall whether 
  he ever applied this policy to decisions on advertising that he made in 1999 
  and 2000. (Prince Dep., p. 6.) Shorter testified that she couldn't recall whether 
  the policy was ever in effect, and then testified that if it had been, she didn't 
  think it was after 1995. (Shorter Dep., pp. 29-30.) When presented with the 
  Staff Summary Sheet regarding Commercial & Public Advertising Policy<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup> 
  that had been brought before the Board of Directors one month prior, Shorter 
  claimed she did not know whether the recommendations embodied in that document 
  were ever adopted, notwithstanding the fact that she, as Director of Marketing, 
  in addition to her assistant staff, and the then General Manager all signed 
  the document recommending its adoption and were exclusively responsible for 
  MBTA advertising. (Shorter Dep., pp. 29-30.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">It is a matter of public 
  record, of course, that these recommendations were, in fact, adopted. Indeed, 
  Exhibit X is the very policy that the First Circuit concluded was "almost 
  impossible to understand," and created "opportunities for discrimination 
  . . . [that] have been borne out in practice" in the AIDS Action case. 
  42 F.3d at 47-48, 50. Also in answers to interrogatories, the defendants suggest 
  for the first time that MBTA Specifications for Transit Advertising, dated August 
  26, 1992, might have applied to Shorter's decision. (Defs. Ans. to Ints. No. 
  9, at Ex. S.) This document, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit Z contains 
  the bid specifications for the contract between PTD and the MBTA. (Shorter Dep., 
  p. 17.) At his deposition, however, Prince testified that he could not recall 
  whether or not he applied this document to any of his decisions to reject or 
  accept proposed advertisements one way or the other during the 1999 -2000 time 
  period. (Prince Dep., pp. 7-9.) Indeed, he testified that he could not recall 
  whether he had ever even seen the document prior to the date of his deposition 
  on April 4, 2001. (Id.) Shorter testified that she believed these specifications 
  were in effect at the time of her decision to reject the plaintiff's proposed 
  ads, yet it is undisputed that what she actually attached to her fax of January 
  20, 2000 were the not as yet in effect 1999 bid specifications for a contract 
  ultimately entered into between the MBTA and TDI, not PTD.<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Despite the plain language 
  of the Albertelli cover letter and Shorter fax, once litigation was underway,

  cover letter to White in January 2000: "Their reasons for not accepting 
  this campaign are clearly stated in the info. provided," (Ex. K), at deposition 
  Albertelli testified that she now believes that Shorter's fax was just her response 
  after "a first review,"and that she sent the response to White because 
  "for me to interpret what this [fax] says may not be exactly what it says. 
  So that's why I sent it to him." (Albertelli Dep., pp. 29-31.). Shorter 
  insisted that her fax was "to remind" Albertelli that "she needed 
  to work with the client," (Shorter Dep., p. 36.), yet even taking that 
  as true, Shorter's motivation is what is material: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> At the 
  time that Miss Albertelli sent you these ads, did you form the conclusion that 
  the ads did not comply with the MBTA's advertising guidelines? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Answer:</b> I thought 
  it would be pushing it a little, yes.</font></p>

    the Climate's ad campaign was still selected by Albertelli for screening because 
    of its politically provocative content, and still rejected by Shorter because 
    of her hostility to the viewpoint expressed by the campaign and Change the 
    Climate's mission.</b></font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Regardless of whether 
  Shorter's actions were a "rejection" or an "initial objection," 
  and regardless of what back and forth Shorter and Albertelli now say could have 
  occurred, what is material is that both reiterated the reasons for their conduct 
  in their depositions. It is undisputed that Change the Climate's re-submission 
  of the ads for approval would have meant changing the content of the ads to 
  express a message and a viewpoint "acceptable" to the MBTA. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">As for Albertelli, she 
  testified that her decision to forward the ads to Shorter was based on what 
  amounted to a hunch that they might not be acceptable to the MBTA because of 
  their provocative nature.<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup> She did not use considered 
  judgment or actually apply any guidelines or policies.26 (Albertelli Dep., pp. 
  37, 50-51.) With respect to Shorter' fax, she testified that she wanted White 
  to understand that the "creative" (i.e. the copy) he sent was "not 
  acceptable" to the MBTA. (Id. at 31.) She testified that Shorter's response 
  created an opportunity for Change the Climate to "go back to the drawing 
  board and come up with another creative." (Id.) (emphasis added). In other 
  words, to come up with an acceptable message. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">As for Shorter, like 
  Albertelli, she freely admitted that she didn't form her views on CTC' campaign 
  by making a careful review of the ads. She didn't "zero in and try to interpret" 
  the ads' meaning (Shorter Dep., pp. 42-43), but rather, formed her opinion "in 
  a general broad sweep." (Id. at 41.) Having no idea what First Amendment 
  rights of advertisers to keep in mind, Shorter testified that she "knew" 
  that the ads did not comply with the MBTA's advertising guidelines and "sent 
  them back" accordingly. (Id. at 46). Why? Because in her view, the ads 
  "would be pushing it a little," and it was Albertelli's responsibility 
  to "work out what would be acceptable to the MBTA" if Change the Climate 
  wanted to get their advertisements posted. (Id. at 37-38.) She reiterated that 
  it was the "content" that was not acceptable: ". . .because of 
  the content and you looked at our guidelines, that she [Albertelli] needed to 
  go back and work with her client." (Id. at 39.) She admitted that the ads 
  were intended to convey a message (Shorter Dep., pp. 41, 45, 47) and that "she 
  [Albertelli] could have gone to Change the Climate and said change the language 
  or whatever they wanted to promote. She could have worked that out with them 
  and resubmitted it." (Id. at p. 47.) Indeed, she admitted that what violated 
  the guidelines was the text of the ads, and more specifically, the message sent 
  by the words:</font></p>

  of the guidelines:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> But 
  there is nothing about the three illustrations in these ads that violated any

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> And

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Shorter Dep., pp. 49-50). 
  Shorter also reiterated that she perceived Change the Client's mission as legalizing 
  marijuana, (Id. at 52-53, 59, 72-73), and that in her opinion, the ads did not 
  send any message about changing the law, but rather, were promoting marijuana 
  use.27 (Id. at 54.) While Shorter attempted to evade the plain language of her 
  fax, which states "the T's appearance and character, Policy & Drug 
  & Alcohol policy is [sic] in conflict with their mission," the language 
  speaks for itself: Shorter viewed the mission of Change the Climate, in her 
  own words,"to change the laws," to be in conflict with the guidelines.28 
  (Shorter Dep., p. 60.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Ultimately, regardless 
  of whether the defendants' actions were then a rejection or an objection, what 
  remains material and undisputed is their assertion - in both interrogatory answers 
  and in deposition testimony - that the MBTA will not accept any of the proposed 
  advertisements for placement on MBTA facilities and vehicles to date, for the 
  same reasons as before. (Def. Ans. to Ints. No. 3, at Ex. S; Prince Dep., p. 
  27; Shorter Dep., pp. 78-79.). Both defendants Prince and Shorter testified 
  that they would not run the ads because of the viewpoint they perceived the 
  ads expressed: </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>J. Change The Climate's 
  Other Advertising Campaigns.</b><br>
  Despite the serious setback Change the Climate experienced in launching its 
  first advertising campaign in Boston that prompted the instant law suit, CTC 
  initiated a second campaign in Washington, D.C. Initially the Washington Metro 
  Transit Authority ("the Metro") rejected Change the Climate's proposed 
  advertisements claiming the ads violated a Metro policy that purported to restrict 
  public advertisements to those "not designed to influence legislation or 
  public opinion on a controversial subject." After the American Civil Liberties 
  Union threatened suit on behalf of CTC, however, the Metro relented, and agreed 
  to post 560 ads on marijuana issues. CTC ultimately paid a discounted advertising 
  rate to the Metro in exchange for illuminated signs on 10 subway platforms, 
  large exterior signs for 50 buses and smaller signs for the interiors of an 
  additional 500 buses. The month-long campaign consisted of three ads<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup> 
  - one of which was the very same ad that is the subject of this lawsuit - that 
  were ultimately displayed by the Metro.<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup> (White Dep., p. 49; White Aff., 14.) 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In light of the positive 
  responses CTC received on the D.C. campaign, it launched a second ad campaign 
  that ran on 36 Metro bus shelters throughout the month of May 2001.<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup> 
  (White Aff., 14) After two successful campaigns in the nation's capital, CTC 
  is currently planning transit advertising campaigns in New York City, Chicago, 
  and San Francisco. CTC has also received requests for assistance with advertising 
  campaigns in Indianapolis, Portland, Oregon, and other locations. With each 
  successful campaign, CTC hopes to gain the momentum necessary to accomplish 
  its goal to generate millions of advertising impressions through advertising 
  in as many cities throughout the nation as possible. (White Aff., 15.)</font></p>

<li><a name="4"></a>This is true regardless of whether one views the subject as a complex health and social problem, as Joe White and other thoughtful speakers like those identified above do, or whether one views the subject from a moral high ground, as The Boston Herald reported Governor Cellucci viewed the subject after Change the Climate filed suit in this case.  In applauding Governor Celluccis reported and highly politicized opposition to Change the Climates proposed advertisements, referring to CTCs ad campaign as nonsense, the Boston Herald proclaimed:  That marijuana acclimates users to a drug high, and often encourages the use of harder substances, is well documented.  See The Boston Herald, Cellucci just says no A Boston Herald editorial, September 22, 2000.  (White Aff., 6-12, attaching the Herald editorial and Whites response, in which he notes the misquotation of Change the Climates media campaign).
</li>

<li><a name="5"></a>Amazingly, both Prince and Shorter testified that they were not aware that the MBTA accepts political advertising, (Prince Dep., p. 46; Shorter, pp. 62-63), but it is undisputed that it does.  Attached as Exhibit E are copies of various political advertisements displayed by the MBTA that were produced during discovery in this litigation.  (See also Exhibits 6 and 7, infra.)</li>

(Defendants Responses to Plaintiffs Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 19, 20, copies of which are attached as Exhibit F.)
</li>
<li><a name="8"></a>Albertelli also testified that advertisers would sometimes request reconsideration of ads that were rejected, but that they would have to agree to change the message of the ad:  It was just in general terms, look, this message is X, Y, Z; therefore, if you can change it somehow, or make it less provocative or whatever the case may be, then fine. (Albertelli Dep.,. at 57.) (emphasis added).  There is no record evidence that the MBTA has ever reconsidered a political ad for display after raising initial objections.  Albertelli gave but one example as to a commercial advertiser advertising an alcohol product, which she recalls contained provocative content.  (Id. at 14-15.) 
</li>
<li><a name="9"></a>Despite her conversations with Joe White and her perusal of the materials he sent her, Albertelli refused to testify at her deposition as to what her understanding of the purpose of CTCs advertising campaign was at that time.  (Albertelli Dep., p. 40.)</li>
<li><a name="10"></a>This is consistent with Albertellis deposition testimony.  While she testified that she couldnt recall the specifics of any of her conversations with White (Albertelli Dep., pp.19-20, 32-33), and refused to testify as to her then-interpretation of the ads that prompted her to send them to Shorter in the first place (Id. at 34-38, 42-43), she consistently testified that her understanding of CTCs media campaign, (based upon what she could, ultimately, recall of her initial conversations and meeting with Joe White) was that he was definitely looking to educate, as he put it, the public and make the public aware of the uses of marijuana, the effects  the benefits of decriminalizing marijuana, things along those lines, so I guess it would be a different spin than what the laws about marijuana are as they exist today . . . .  (Id. at 40.)  In addition, she testified that whatever thoughts she had at the time that prompted her to bring the ads to Shorters attention, it was not that she believed the ads were promoting the smoking of marijuana.  (Id. at 38.)   She even testified that it would have been silly to say the ads were telling anybody to smoke marijuana.  (Id. at 44.)  This is consistent with Whites testimony that Albertelli seemed surprised that the ads were rejected based on their content.  (White Dep., p. 129.)</li>
<li><a name="11"></a>White testified that he believes he sent the packet to both Albertelli and Shorter,  in addition to the previous materials he sent to Shorter at Albertellis direction.  (White Dep., p. 93-94.)  In any event, it is undisputed that the packet was received and reviewed by both Albertelli and Shorter.  In fact, Shorter acknowledged that she reviewed two sets of proposed ads by CTC, the second set to which she attached her January 20, 2000 response (Shorter Dep., p. 33-35; see also White Dep., p. 123.)  Other than sending one or two sets of materials at Albertellis direction, White did not make any real attempt to contact Shorter directly.  Albertelli made clear to White that she was the agent for the MBTA and it would be inappropriate for him to try to contact the MBTA by phone for advertising.  While White recalls making one phone call to Shorter at some point by way of introduction, it was to no avail, so he did not do so again. (White Dep., pp. 92, 121-22, 175.)</li>
<li><a name="12"></a>Shorter testified that she perceived Change the Climates mission was to legalize marijuana, which, incidentally, it is not.  (Shorter Dep., p. 53, 56-57; Ex. 1; White Aff.,  3-5; White Dep., pp. 174-75.)</li>
<li><a name="12"></a>Shorter testified that she perceived Change the Climates mission was to legalize marijuana, which, incidentally, it is not.  (Shorter Dep., p. 53, 56-57; Ex. 1; White Aff.,  3-5; White Dep., pp. 174-75.)</li>
<li><a name="13"></a>Prince at first claimed a lack of knowledge as to when the 1999 specifications went into effect (see Prince Dep., pp. 10-12) , but ultimately acknowledged that they went into effect, as common sense would dictate, at the time the contract between TDI and the MBTA was signed on May 30, 2000. (Id. at 12-13.)  In any event, when Prince was asked whether the alleged revised specifications were actually in effect at the time the plaintiff submitted its ads for approval in 1999, he referred to the Mabardy letter (see pp. 21-22, infra.) as the only document he could be certain was in effect at the time.  (Prince Dep., pp. 11, 14-15.)  When pressed with the question whether he could point to any document that evidences when those specifications went into effect, Prince returned to his stock answer:  I dont recall.  (Id. at 36.)  As described above, Shorters testimony was equally evasive (Shorter Dep., pp. 16, 22) and equally unavailing (Id. at pp. 23-24, 26).</li>
<li><a name="14"></a>Nonetheless, Shorter testified:  I put in there the drug and alcohol policy not  at the time I probably shouldnt have  but anything promoting drugs is illegal.  Its not so much the alcohol part but the drug part.  (Shorter Dep., p. 58.)  Apparently, to this day, Shorter believes that this policy  a policy she recognized in deposition is applicable to employees, vendors, and contractors . . . who are not allowed to possess or distribute drugs   could be applicable to advertisers, even though on the very face of the policy, and by her very own testimony, it most certainly does not.  (Id. at 70-72.)</li>
<li><a name="15"></a>See Shorter Dep., p.80.  According to the interview, Riveras current title is Deputy Press Secretary for the Office of Public Affairs. The tape is attached as Exhibit 9.</li>
<li><a name="16"></a>For the sake of completeness, the plaintiff has provided a copy of the entire interview, including the portion of the interview of White, for the Court.  The plaintiff does not object to the plaintiffs testimony being admitted as evidence in this case, even if not submitted independently by the defendants, who obtained a copy of the cassette from the plaintiff during discovery.</li>
<li><a name="17"></a>For example, Prince could not say whether a proposed ad for Petes Wicked Ale with the text The World Has Enough Blonds violated the MBTAs policies without knowing what was included in the picture of the advertisement, even assuming the illustration was simply a glass of beer.  (Prince Dep., pp. 21-24)   When pressed whether another Petes Wicked Ale advertisement with the text It was Petes first.  Be Gentle violated the guidelines,  Prince stated that those six words violated the Mabardy letter guidelines because he believed that those words had a double entendre meaning; this despite the language of the letter which states, in relevant part:  These guidelines shall not be deemed to prohibit indecent or frightening language that could be considered double entendre, provided that, if a child asked an adult the meaning of such indecent or frightening language, the adult could give a reasonable and truthful answer without reference to indecent or frightening activities or language. Id. at 25-26.  The plaintiff suggests that the ad could easily be explained by the words loss of virginity, which constitute neither indecent nor frightening activity or language, according to the MBTAs own definition of indecent in the policy. (Id. at pp. 24-25.)  For record evidence of several ads currently displayed on MBTA trains, stations, and buses, containing double entendre meanings, referring, for example, to the buzzof drug use, reaching new heights in achieving orgasm, and making light of the very serious symptoms (Im itchy) and contagiousness (3 out of 4 people . . .) of sexually transmitted diseases, see Aunkst Aff.,  5,9.</li>
<li><a name="18"></a>The MBTA has posted other advertising concerning the subject of death, including one suicide prevention ad which depicts a row of tombstones in the graphics.  See Aunkst Aff.,  6.  Query whether this inconsistent application of standards reflects the MBTAs desire to protect  children from disturbing and frightening images, or to protect its own revenues, for which alcohol promotions seem to comprise a significant share.</li>
<li><a name="19"></a>While both The Boston Globe article and ACLU letter were produced by the defendants during discovery, no responsive letter was produced.</li>
<li><a name="20"></a>Significantly, before the defendants depositions were taken in this case, in answering Plaintiffs Interrogatory No. 4, which asked the defendants to please state the text of each and every policy the MBTA asserts bars the MBTA from displaying the advertisements submitted by the plaintiff, the defendants reproduced, verbatim, the language of Article VII of the contract specifications that Shorter attached to her January 2000 fax (Ex. D) only.  (Defs. Ans. to Ints. No. 4, at Ex. S.)  While the defendants did not acknowledge the source of this excerpt as the 1999 contract specifications for the TDI contract in that answer, they make no mention of any other policy whatsoever in their answer.  (Id.)  In subsequent answers, the defendants vaguely suggested that various other policies were in existence and/or modified in light of the Aids Action, Citizens to End Animal Suffering, and Preterm cases, (Id. at Nos. 7, 9, at Ex. S), yet none of the defendants would or could say just how the policies were modified, whether in interrogatory answers or in deposition testimony.  Furthermore, as detailed above, neither Prince, as General Manager nor Shorter, as Director of Marketing Communications, could be certain what specific policies applied when or how.</li>
<li><a name="21"></a>
Though that didnt stop Prince from testifying otherwise:<br><br> 

<b>Question:</b> Is there anything in that 1995 guideline thats violated by these three specific ads? 
<br><br>
<b>Answer:</b> I believe that it tells children to break the law.
<br><br>
<b>Question:</b> Can you read me the part of the guideline thats violated by those ads, please?
<br><br>
<b>Answer:</b> The terms, frightening or of a nature to frighten children, either emotionally or physically, showing them language or pictures that describe or depict violent criminal or brutal activities or the end result of violent or brutal activities that were intended  whether such violence or brutality was intended or not in a manner which causes a child in physical or emotional distress.  This could put a child in jail.  Thats emotional distress. 
<br><br>
<b>Question:</b> So its your opinion that these three ads violate the provisions of the 1995 guidelines that you just read?
<br><br> 
<b>Answer:</b> This, Yes.
<br><br>
(Prince Dep., p. 32-33.)  It is noteworthy that Prince also testified that the ads violated the MBTAs guidelines prohibiting ads depicting violent criminal content (Id. at 37), as well as those prohibiting ads that denigrate groups based by gender, religion, race or ethnic affiliation.  (Id. at 38.)  As with the Mabardy letter, it is undisputed that none of these standards could possibly apply to the plaintiffs ads.

<li><a name="22"></a> A copy of the Staff Summary Sheet, dated January 15, 1993, is attached as Exhibit Y.  Included in the document, rather tellingly, is a section entitled ALTERNATIVES to adoption of a new policy, which reads as follows:

The alternative is to forego implementation of formal guidelines on acceptable advertising and continue to screen advertising based simply on the Authoritys right to apply its discretion in accepting advertising.  This alternative is not recommended as it will perpetuate the current lack of clarity about the role of transit advertising in fulfilling the MBTAs mission.</li>
<li><a name="23"></a>While the Defendants Answers to Interrogatories make vague and unexplained reference to another purported policy, Specifications for Transit Advertising, dated October 15, 1999, no such document was produced in discovery and neither Shorter nor Prince nor Albertelli testified about any such document at their depositions.</li>
<li><a name="24"></a>At the end of her deposition, upon examination by defense counsel, Albertelli professed that the fax Shorter sent her wasnt the way in which she would receive a formal rejection of an advertising campaign for the MBTA.  (Albertelli Dep., p. 57.)  Yet she also testified that the form defendants Shorter and Prince testified they used was an internal form that she had never seen before.  (Id. at 24-25.)  And when asked what was the form that formal rejections came in, she answered I was afraid you guys would ask me that, because I dont remember. (Id. at 59.)  There is simply no record evidence that there was any formal rejection procedure between the MBTA and PTD.  Indeed, Albertellis last two pages of deposition testimony are belied by her earlier testimony.  According to Albertelli, Shorters rejections could be even less formal than a fax sheet:   Sometimes, by the way, she wouldnt always call or she would have someone call and say Im going to fax you a response.  It depended how in depth the conversation needed to be. (Id. at 21.)</li>
<li><a name="25"></a>While plaintiffs counsel asked Albertelli her specific interpretation of the ads, she refused to answer the question.  (Albertelli Dep., pp. 34-35.)  She insisted It was not our responsibility to sit in judgement or have opinions and that she always reserved that God-given  right to just give it to Lucy and let her be objective about it. . . .  Nevertheless, she admitted that she had to make a determination whether something was provocative or not when reviewing proposed ads, an admission that discredits her testimony that she was never making a judgment on content.( Id. at 37, 54.)  She also admitted that whatever her thoughts were at the time, she did not believe that the ads were promoting the smoking of marijuana by young people or people generally.  (Id. at 39, 44.)  In the end, Albertelli testified she didnt bother looking at the guidelines.  (Id. at 42-43; see also note 27, infra.)</li>
<li><a name="26"></a>
To the contrary, when asked whether she looked at any guidelines before deciding to send CTCs proposed ads to Shorter, she was emphatic that she wouldnt dream of looking at guidelines before screening advertisements for display:<br><br>

<b>Question:</b> Did you do that?  Did you look at the guidelines and form an opinion as to whether these ads 
<br><br>
<b>Answer:</b> No, no, no.  I always sent them to Lucy and let her make that judgment call, because to me, they really put those guidelines forth and interpret them, and thats what her job and their job was.  
<br><br>

<li><a name="27"></a>Though when asked the direct question: So you concluded that the message being sent by this advertising campaign was that people should be smoking marijuana?, she answered, in contortionist fashion:   They were promoting.  Not that they should be, but that the campaign was promoting.  (Shorter Dep., p. 54.)   And when asked the question so an ad that said we should change the marijuana laws., www.changetheclimate.org, that wouldnt have been in conflict with any of the Ts policies?,  she refused to answer the question.  (Id. at 73-74.)</li>
<li><a name="28"></a>The fax and Shorters testimony, and not defense counsels addendum to Shorters testimony in deposition, are the record evidence in this case.  (Shorter Dep., p. 61.)</li>

<li><a name="29"></a>The first ad, which was displayed in the Metro stations  including the one closest to the White House  features a young woman with the text, "Why do kids go to jail for doing what politicians did when they were young?  Tell us the truth."   The second ad, displayed inside buses, features a business executive with the text:  Ive got cancer.  I smoke pot after chemotherapy.  Its my choice, right?  Wrong.  The third, which appeared on the outside of Metro buses, is the identical advertisement that is the subject of the present law suit, featuring two police officers standing in front of an American flag with the text: "Police are too important . . . too valuable . . . too good . . . to waste on arresting people for marijuana when real criminals are on the loose."  (White Aff. , 14.)</li>
<li><a name="30"></a>The Metro bus in the photograph attached to Whites affidavit was but one of 50 buses with a Change the Climate ad run as part of the first D.C. campaign.  (White Aff.,  14.) </li>
<li><a name="31"></a>The ad that ran on 36 bus shelters had the following text with no pictures:   America 1992 to 1999.  4.3 million tobacco deaths.  2.3 million alcohol deaths.  0 marijuana deaths.  Tell us the truth . . .  There has not been a single reported act of lawlessness connected with either of Change the Climates advertising campaigns in Washington, D.C., nor any evidence that children or adults have used marijuana as a result of the advertising campaign.
