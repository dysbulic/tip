  INC.'S RESPONSE TO <br>
  DEFENDANTS' STATEMENT OF UNCONTESTED FACTS</b> </font> 
</center>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Pursuant to Fed. R. 
  Civ. P. 56 and Local Rule 56.1, the plaintiff Change the Climate, Inc. submits 
  this response to the defendants' statement of uncontested facts (&quot;Def. 
  SOF&quot;) filed by the defendants in support of their motion for summary judgment. 
  The plaintiff, too, has moved for summary judgment on all counts of its complaint. 
  The plaintiff relies on its statement of uncontested facts (&quot;Pl. SOF&quot;) 
  in support of both that motion as well as this response to show that there are 
  no material facts in dispute.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Although the plaintiff is confident that there 
  are no genuine issues to be tried, the plaintiff is compelled to respond to 
  each of the defendants' statements of facts because &quot;material facts of 
  record set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving party 
  will be deemed for purposes of the motion to be admitted by opposing parties 
  unless controverted by the statement required to be served by opposing parties.&quot; 
  Local R. 56(1) (emphasis added). The plaintiff submits this response not only 
  to set the record straight, but also, in some instances, to correct misrepresentations 
  of the record evidence so as to redirect the Court to the actual undisputed 
  evidence in this case. <br>
  <br>
  To aid the Court in separating truth from fiction, each of the defendants' enumerated 
  paragraphs from Defendants' SOF is reproduced below, followed by the Plaintiff's 
  Response. The response sets forth the reasons the plaintiff disputes each paragraph, 
  whether in whole or in part. Key admissions are identified, as are omissions 
  of material facts and other material misrepresentations of evidence. References 
  to Plaintiff's SOF are made, where possible, to avoid needless repetition. Finally, 
  those statements that should be stricken from the record as inadmissible are 
  identified, and references are provided to the Plaintiff's Motion to Strike 
  Portions of the Defendants' Statement of Uncontested Facts (&quot;Pl. Motion 
  to Strike&quot;), which the plaintiff has filed as a separate motion in accordance 
  with the rules of civil procedure. </font></p>

    Plaintiff Change the Climate, Inc., is a non-profit corporation. Its president 
    is Joe White<br>
    of Greenfield, Mass., a telemarketing consultant. (Amended Complaint, 1, 6.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    The defendants rely solely on the Amended Complaint in support of this paragraph. 
    Nowhere in the Amended Complaint is White identified as a &quot;telemarketing 
    consultant.&quot; (See Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(g).) Joe White is the founder 
    and Executive Director of Change the Climate. His full-time occupation, separate 
    and apart from Change the Climate, is to serve as the Vice President of The 
    Share Group, Inc., a company that offers consulting, fund-raising and marketing 
    services to nonprofit organizations and socially responsible businesses. (White 
    Aff., 1, White Dep., p. 19-20.) <br>

    At the heart of this case are three advertisements created on a home computer 
    by White. All three advertisements have a large picture, minimal text, and 
    nothing to identify the nature of the organization sponsoring them other than 
    a Web site: &quot;www.changetheclimate.org.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    Copies of the advertisements, attached to Pl. SOF as Exhibit B, are evidence 
    in this case and speak for themselves. The defendants' characterization of 
    that evidence is not itself evidence and should be disregarded. (See Pl. Motion 
    to Strike, 5(g).) The defendants' assertion that there is &quot;nothing to 
    identify the nature of the organization sponsoring them other than a Web site: 
    &quot;www.changetheclimate.org&quot; supplies its own response: the web site 
    is the identifying information. The raison d'etre of Change the Climate has 
    always been, and continues to be, quite literally, to &quot;change the climate&quot; 
    around the discussion of marijuana policies in this country by broadening 
    the terms of the debate. (White Aff., 2, White Dep., p. 26. ) Furthermore, 
    the plaintiff points out that the MBTA is currently displaying at least one 
    advertisement regarding drug-related content for which the only identifying 
    information as to the sponsor of the advertisements are two web addresses 
    and a phone number that direct readers to learn more, if they so choose. (See 
    Aunkst Aff., 7(b).) The defendants have not pointed to any guideline that 
    requires any more identifying information than that, nor can they, because 
    none exists. Such a policy, without a compelling interest, would be highly 
    suspect under the First Amendment.<br>

    The first advertisement (the &quot;Teen Ad&quot;) features a photograph of 
    a teen-aged girl wearing a baseball cap worn fashionably backwards. The text 
    says, &quot;Smoking pot is not cool, but we're not stupid, ya know. Marijuana 
    is NOT cocaine or heroine. Tell us the truth...&quot;<br>
    <br>

    The advertisement, a copy of which is attached to Pl. SOF as Ex. B, is evidence 
    in this case and speaks for itself. The defendants' characterization of that

    them to smoke pot. But I know jail is a lot more dangerous than smoking pot.&quot;<br>

    when real criminals are on the loose.&quot;<br>

    White conceived of and designed these Ads by himself. He wrote the text, created 
    the<br>
    layout, and downloaded the photographs from the Internet. At his deposition, 
    he<br>
    described the process of creating the Ads as follows: <br>
    <br>
    I had a bunch of scrambled thoughts, and I would write them into my computer 
    and change the words and, you know, press the delete key. And then I tried 
    to create pictures in my mind about what the advertisements would look like. 
    (White Depo. at 44.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    To quote this excerpt of White's deposition is an attempt to bias the Court 
    against White by implying that he is unable to think and communicate carefully 
    and clearly.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Contrary to the defendants' insinuation, 
    White's creation of the advertisements was an ongoing and thoughtful one, 
    and not something he cobbled together haphazardly, as excerpts of White's 
    deposition the defendants omit demonstrate: <br>
    <br>
    I don't think I made it clear earlier about the creative process. It's not 
    like you think of something, and it's done or a fait accompli. It goes through 
    iteration after iteration after iteration as you reflect on things and as 
    you ponder the issues large and small; the type size, the colors, the right 
    photograph. All of that information is a process, and it takes a year, six 
    months, three months, you know, from start to finish. So that's my answer 
    to your question. That process takes a long time. And so when you're saying 
    were you thinking of Change the Climate ads during that period of time, the 
    short simple answer might just be yes. But it's a long process, and I can't 
    be entirely certain at what point I was thinking about it or if it had come 
    to a beginning or end. <br>
    <br>
    (White Dep., p. 68.) While White's creative process is, of course, immaterial 
    to the issues in this case, for additional excerpts in his seven and a half 
    hour deposition, in which he answered several irrelevant questions on the 
    creative process through production of the advertisements, see White Dep., 
    pp. 43-44, 68, 78-79. For further evidence of the seriousness with which White 
    has undertaken founding and maintaining the plaintiff organization, in addition 
    to working his full time job, see White Aff. at Tabs 1, 3, 5 and 6, attached 
    to Pl. SOF at Exhibit 1. <br>

    It is undisputed that White, a telemarketing consultant, has no experience 
    or training in media or advertising. (White Depo. at 7-17, 20-21, 78.) He 
    has never worked with an advertising consultant or advertising professional 
    of any type, nor with a media consultant or media professional. (White Depo. 
    at 43-44, 71-73.) He created the Ads alone; other than White, &quot;nobody 
    had anything to do with the ads.&quot; (White Depo. at 21-22, 43-44, 71-73.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    Again, White is the Vice President of the Share Group, not a mere &quot;telemarketing 
    consultant.&quot; (See 1, supra.; Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(g).) Unless the 
    defendants are suggesting that White is too inexperienced and lacking in training 
    to speak, this paragraph is utterly immaterial to the issues in this case.

  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Defendants' SOF:

    White testified at his deposition that he decided to create the Ads because 
    he felt there needed to be more public debate about marijuana policy. (White 
    Depo. at 23.) Although he says the purpose of the Ads is to &quot;stimulate 
    public debate on this issue&quot; (White Depo. at 24), at his deposition he 
    could not articulate any particular message he believed the Ads convey. Indeed, 
    he testified that the Advertisements have no intended message. When questioned 
    about what aspect of marijuana policy the Ads sought to address, he could 
    not identify any. He testified, &quot;We don't have any specific policy or 
    issue that we're trying to address in our efforts.&quot;' (White Depo. at 
    28-29.) [Footnote 3: Mr. White thereby disavowed the language of the Amended 
    Complaint, which sought to characterize the Ads as a campaign &quot;to change 
    attitudes and promote public discussion about marijuana policy reform.&quot; 
    (Amended Cmplt., 16.)]<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    The plaintiff agrees that White intended the ads to stimulate public debate 
    on marijuana policies. (See also White Aff., 2, 3.) The defendants' make one 
    of several key admissions in the second sentence of their rendition of the 
    facts, stating that &quot;although he says the purpose of the Ads is to 'stimulate 
    public debate on this issue,' at his deposition he could not articulate any 
    particular message he believed the Ads convey.&quot; Even taking as true the 
    statement that the ads offer no particular message other than to get people 
    to think about and debate marijuana policy in the abstract, that message - 
    i.e., one that advocates for public debate on drug policy - is protected core 
    political speech in and of itself. (See Pl. SOF at 4-6.) The defendants' assertion 
    that in order for the advertisements to stimulate debate they must have a 
    particular message thus completely misses the mark - both of the media campaign 
    and the First Amendment. White testified repeatedly that the message that 
    each reader takes from each advertisement is, inevitably, an individualized, 
    personal response, unique to different individuals. (Id. at 30-31, 149, 164, 
    168-70.) The defendants fail to acknowledge White's testimony in this regard 
    in their rendition of facts. Furthermore, the plaintiff is compelled to point 
    out that, notwithstanding the select excerpts of White's deposition cited 
    by the defendants, White gave various examples of broad public perceptions 
    that Change the Climate seeks to address and questions it seeks to raise, 
    such as: <br>
    <br>
    that people believe &quot;that marijuana, otherwise known as hemp, can't be 
    used in any industrial or manufacturing capacity&quot; and &quot;that marijuana 
    does not have any medicinal value, and yet the government has shown that there 
    likely is medicinal value&quot; (White Dep., p. 38.)<br>
    <br>
    that reform organizations such as Change the Climate, and White as a parent, 
    believe that &quot;marijuana is not okay for kids&quot; (Id. at 39.)<br>
    <br>
    how marijuana issues &quot;affect families, how they affect kids, how they 
    affect our society,&quot; and that &quot;jail is a potential result of smoking 
    pot, and that's a scary thought for many parents&quot; (Id. at 148-49.)<br>
    <br>
    that &quot;smoking pot is not a cool thing for kids to do&quot; and &quot;that 
    there is a huge difference between marijuana and cocaine and heroin.&quot; 
    (Id. at 157-58.)<br>
    <br>
    how police resources are allocated in this society, and &quot;whether or not 
    choices, correct choices, are being made about the distribution and use of 
    those police officer resources.&quot; (Id. at 168-70.) <br>
    <br>
    For additional evidence concerning Change the Climate's organizational purpose 
    and media campaign, see copies of pages printed from Change the Climate's 
    website at &quot;www.changetheclimate.org&quot;, attached to White Aff. at 
    Tabs 1, 3, 5 and 6, attached to Pl. SOF at Exhibit 1. (See also White Affidavit, 
    2-4.)<br>
    <br>
    Finally, the defendants' assertion that &quot;Mr. White thereby disavowed 
    the language of the Amended Complaint, which sought to characterize the Ads 
    as a campaign to change attitudes and promote public discussion about marijuana 
    policy reform&quot; is not only erroneous, but also inappropriately relies 
    on the Amended Complaint as evidence in this case and should be stricken.

    Nor could he identify any message that he believed the Advertisements succeeded 
    in conveying. For example, when asked about the message of the Police Ad, 
    White conceded, &quot;I don't know what message it sends to people.&quot; 
    (White Depo. at 170.) Asked whether he was trying to advocate a particular 
    position in the Teen Ad, he testified, &quot;Change the Climate does not have 
    a particular position.&quot; (White Depo. at 158-159.) Asked what message 
    Change the Climate wanted its audience to take away from the Mother Ad, White 
    testified, &quot;Change the Climate does not have necessarily [sic] any specific 
    positions on issues. . . .&quot; (White Depo. at 148-149.) Asked why he chose 
    a mother figure for the Mother Ad, White said, &quot;Because everyone has 
    a mother, and mothers are really special.&quot; (White Depo. at 149.) Asked 
    why he used the word &quot;pot&quot; instead of &quot;marijuana&quot; in the 
    Teen Ad, White said, &quot;I don't know.&quot; (White Depo. at 156-157.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    Again, this paragraph misses the point of the media campaign, which is to 
    raise questions in peoples' minds about marijuana issues. It also selectively 
    omits the portions of White's deposition in which he identifies some of the 
    broader issues and types of questions that CTC's media campaign could conjure 
    up in the minds of individuals in the general public, as related above in 
    Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' SOF (&quot;Pl. Resp. Def. SOF&quot;),

    In September, 1998, Joe White began to explore whether his Ads might be displayed 
    on the subways and buses, and in stations, of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation 
    Authority. (White Depo. at 64-67, 83, 102.) After obtaining the MBTA's &quot;media 
    kit&quot; on September 15, 1998 (White Depo. at 65-67, 108-111), White decided 
    to try to raise money to have the Ads displayed on the T. To that end, on 
    April 15, 1999, he formed the plaintiff corporation. (White Depo. at 105.) 
    <br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    The defendants' suggestion that White founded Change the Climate as a means 
    to raise money to display the plaintiff's advertisements on the MBTA is beyond 
    the pale. White founded Change the Climate because he felt there needed to 
    be more public debate on the issues surrounding marijuana policies, and to 
    educate the public on these issues. (White Dep, p. 23; White Aff., 2; see 
    also Change the Climate's Mission Statement and Articles of Incorporation, 
    attached to Pl. SOF as Exhibit 1.) In addition to being immaterial to the 
    issues in this case, the defendants' assertion also ignores the record evidence 
    of the plaintiff organization on the whole, which consists of more than its 
    media campaign, and, most notably, includes the organization's web site, &quot;www.changtheclimage.org&quot; 
    (See White Aff. 2-4, Tabs 1, 3, 5, 6.) White founded the plaintiff organization, 
    initiated the media campaign, and created the web site all towards executing 
    Change the Climate's long term strategy to &quot;change the climate&quot; 
    around marijuana. (See Pl. SOF, Ex. 1; White Aff., 2-5, 8.)<br>

    The MBTA is the principal commuter transportation service in the Boston metropolitan 
    area. Its subways and buses accommodate more than one million passenger trips 
    a day. (Affidavit of Barbara Moulton (&quot;Moulton Aff.&quot;) at 2.) Many 
    of those passengers are juveniles, between the ages of 9 through [sic] 18. 
    According to the MBTA's most detailed survey of its ridership, 9.9% of the 
    passengers on its bus system in the spring of 1996 either paid a child fare 
    or used a student pass. (Moulton Aff. at 3.) Moreover, the MBTA system ' is 
    an integral part of the Boston Public Schools' system of providing transportation 
    to school children. For the month of March 2001, the MBTA sold 14,876 student 
    passes to students of the Boston Public Schools, including 2,102 to students 
    of Boston Latin School, 1,173 to students of the West Roxbury High School, 
    1,033 to students of Madison Park High School, and 909 to students of Charlestown 
    High School. (Moulton Aff. at 14 and Exh. A; Affidavit of Cornelia A. Kelley 
    (&quot;Kelley Aff.&quot;), 4.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    Taking as true the defendants' assertion that &quot;many&quot; of its passengers 
    are between the ages of 9 and 18 - the ages of &quot;juveniles&quot; the MBTA 
    purportedly wishes to protect - the plaintiff points out that 18 year-olds 
    are old enough to vote and need to be well-informed in order to participate 
    in the political process. Many juveniles younger than 18 are politically active, 
    participating in anti-sweatshop and environmental movements, for example. 
    In May, the city council of Cambridge considered a proposal to permit 16 and 
    17-year-olds to vote in Cambridge municipal elections, a proposal promoted 
    to the council by a concerned group of high school students. (See Mary Hurley, 
    &quot;Council Rejects Lower Voting Age,&quot; Boston Globe, June 5, 2001, 
    at B2.) Furthermore, by the defendants' own statistics, which the plaintiff 
    does not dispute for the purposes of summary judgment, if children or students 
    make up 9.9% of the MBTA's ridership on buses and trains, then adults comprise 
    the remaining 90.1% of ridership, whom the MBTA is also shielding from the 
    plaintiff's political speech. This constitutes a key admission in this case.<br>
    <br>
    With regard to the statement that the MBTA system &quot;is an integral part 
    of the Boston Public School system&quot; because many of its riders are members 
    of that school system, the plaintiff observes that, according to the defendants' 
    logic, the MBTA system then is also an integral part of Gillette Corp., Brigham 
    and Women's Hospital, and FleetBoston because - no doubt - a large number 
    of people who work in those institutions commute by way of public transit.<br>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Defendants' SOF:

    The T's passengers are the audience for a significant number of commercial 
    and public service advertisements. The MBTA system contains more than 40,000 
    advertising displays: approximately 20,000 on and inside buses, 20,000 on 
    and inside trains, and more than 1,000 in T stations. (Moulton Aff. at 5.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    This paragraph contains another key admission in this case. The plaintiff 
    agrees that the MBTA displays both commercial and public service advertisements, 
    including advertisements expressing social, political and religious messages. 
    For a discussion of this undisputed material fact, in which the relevant deposition 
    testimony of Robert Prince, Lucy Shorter, and Elissa Albertelli is quoted 
    at length, see Pl. SOF, pp. 3, 6-9. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Defendants' SOF: 
    <br>
    The MBTA does not display every advertisement submitted to it. That is because, 
    even though a primary purpose of the MBTA's advertising program is to make 
    money, other purposes are to generate customer goodwill and to preserve the 
    advertising environment for its riders who, more often than not, cannot escape 
    viewing these ads when riding the T. (Moulton Aff. 13-17.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    According to the Moulton Affidavit, &quot;[t]he MBTA system contains more 
    than 40,000 advertising displays, approximately 20,000 on and inside buses, 
    20,000 on and inside trains, and more than 1,000 in T stations.&quot; Moulton 
    Aff., 5. By their own key admission, among the tens of thousands of advertisements 
    submitted annually, the MBTA has rejected a sum total of seventeen advertisements 
    over the span of a decade. (Defendants' Answers to Interrogatories No. 5, 
    attached to Pl. SOF as Exhibit S.) For a discussion of this record evidence, 
    indicating that even that number is inflated, see Pl. SOF, pp. 22-24. <br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, the defendants' assertion that a &quot;primary purpose&quot; 
    of the MBTA's advertising space is proprietary is unsupported by the record 
    evidence. Rather, the actual evidence in this case indicates that the primary 
    purpose of the MBTA's advertising space is to post advertisements on a variety 
    of topics, expressing all sorts of messages, for anyone willing to pay the 
    fee - whether commercial or noncommercial, public-interest or not. (See Pl. 
    SOF at 3, 6-9.)<br>
    <br>
    Article X of &quot;the Bid Specs,&quot; to which Moulton refers in paragraph 
    14 of her affidavit and upon which defendants rely as support for their assertion 
    is entitled &quot;Use of Unsold Advertising Space.&quot; It cannot be disputed 
    - from the face of these specifications - that this Article has absolutely 
    no application to the plaintiff's advertisements whatsoever; but, rather, 
    govern the MBTA's practices concerning a small fraction of the MBTA's use 
    of unsold space. Indeed, the Article begins with the sentence: <br>
    <br>
    With respect to all (i) inside or outside display devices or vehicles or (ii) 
    display devices in stations, which are not contracted for use by paid advertisers, 
    the Authority shall have the right to display advertisements or announcements 
    calculated (1) to increase its revenue, public travel, or goodwill or (ii) 
    as compensation to companies which provide beneficial services to the Authority 
    or (iii) to be otherwise in the public interest.<br>
    <br>
    (See Moulton Aff., at Exhibit B.) To the extent that the defendants now rely

    Thus, the T regularly rejects ads the contents of which would drive away the 
    T's ridership or jeopardize its particular obligations to the large school 
    population it transports. From 1992 to November 1, 2000, the MBTA refused 
    to display advertisements on at least 16 instances. (Shorter Aff. 5.) In March 
    1996, for example, the T rejected an advertisement concerning experiments 
    on animals because the advertisement's violent content would disturb and frighten 
    children. (Shorter Aff. at 5(c).) In November 1998, the MBTA rejected an advertisement 
    for the film Psycho because the advertisement contained indecent and violent 
    content. (Shorter Aff. at 5(k).) In the summer of 1999, the MBTA rejected 
    an advertisement concerning under-age drinking because the ad contained graphic, 
    violent, and disturbing content. (Shorter Aff. at 15(n) .) [Footnote 4: Other 
    examples of advertisements that the T has rejected in the past several years 
    are described in the Shorter Affidavit at 15]. The MBTA accepts only those 
    advertisements that comply with the Guidelines and reject all advertisements 
    that fail to comply. (Shorter Aff. 4; Moulton Aff. at 2.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    The first sentence of the above paragraph should be stricken as unsupported 
    by the record evidence. By their own admission made in the very next sentence, 
    the T does not &quot;regularly reject&quot; ads. By their own calculations, 
    of the tens of thousands of ads submitted each year over the span of a decade, 
    they rejected fewer than two ads per year, and even those calculations are 
    misleading. (See Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 13, supra; Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(g).)<br>
    <br>
    The plaintiff agrees that the defendant rejected an advertisement in March 
    1996, but disputes the defendants' characterization that the advertisement 
    contained &quot;violent content&quot; that &quot;would disturb and frighten 
    children.&quot; (See Pl. SOF at 24.) While the defendants did not attach the 
    advertisement to their statement of facts, it is evidence in this case, attached 
    to the Pl. SOF as Exhibit T. The plaintiff submits that the political advertisement, 
    concerning the prevention of animal cruelty, speaks for itself. The offending 
    paragraph of the Shorter affidavit should be stricken. (See Pl. Motion to 
    Strike, 5(g).)<br>
    <br>
    The MBTA did not reject an advertisement for the film Psycho in November 1998. 
    Rather, the undisputed evidence is that the MBTA actually posted the advertisement 
    for the film in the fall of 1998 and ultimately removed the advertisement 
    in November after receiving complaints. Attached hereto as Exhibit A are copies 
    of news articles, produced by the defendants in discovery, reporting on this 
    undisputed fact, quoting MBTA officials. To suggest that the MBTA simply rejected 
    the advertisement in November 1998 as an initial matter is misleading and 
    should be stricken.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> The actual posting of the 
    Psycho ad, like the MBTA's actual posting of the Fatal Instinct ad that was 
    key to the First Circuit's finding of viewpoint discrimination in the AIDS 
    Action case, and the MBTA's actual posting of the BASEketball and Surf detergent 
    ads, are undisputed evidence of the defendants' inconsistent application of 
    standards. This constitutes a key admission that the defendants have, in fact, 
    posted advertisements not in compliance with their purported standards. (See 
    also Pl. SOF at 21-24.) The offending statements, as well as the offending 
    portion of the Shorter and Moulton affidavits, should be stricken. (See Pl. 
    Motion to Strike, 5(e),(f).) <br>
    <br>
    The plaintiff agrees that the defendant rejected an advertisement in the summer 
    of 1999, but disputes the defendants' characterization that &quot;the ad contained 
    graphic, violent, and disturbing content.&quot; While the defendants also 
    did not attach this advertisement to its statement of facts, it is evidence 
    in this case, attached to the Pl. SOF as Exhibit T. The plaintiff submits 
    that this political advertisement, concerning the serious consequences of 
    binge drinking, speaks for itself. (See Pl. SOF at 24 and Exhibits T and U.) 
    The offending paragraphs of the Shorter affidavit should be stricken. (See 
    Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(e), (f).)<br>
    <br>
    For the above reasons, and the additional examples of the MBTA's inconsistent 
    application of standards included in Pl. SOF at 21-24, the final sentence 
    of this paragraph, that &quot;the MBTA accepts only those advertisements that 
    comply with the Guidelines and reject all advertisements that fail to comply&quot; 
    should be stricken as utterly unsupported by the record evidence in this case. 
    The offending paragraphs of the Shorter and Moulton affidavits should likewise 
    be stricken. (See Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(e), (f).) <br>

    The MBTA administers and sells its advertising space through an independent 
    contractor that serves as the T's advertising agent. From 1993 through June 
    2000, that agent was Park Transit Displays, Inc. (&quot;Park Transit&quot;). 
    [Footnote 5: Currently, and since July 2000, the MBTA's advertising agent 
    is Transit Displays Incorporated]. As of January 2000, when Park Transit was 
    operating under an extension to its original contract with the MBTA, the T's 
    guidelines for advertising acceptability were contained in the &quot;Appearance 
    and Character of Advertisements&quot; section (the &quot;Appearance and Character 
    Guidelines&quot; or the &quot;Guidelines&quot;) of its &quot;Specifications 
    for Transit Advertising&quot; dated October 15, 1999 (the &quot;1999 Bid Specs&quot;), 
    which formed part of the bid specifications for the renewal contract. (Shorter 
    Depo. at 21, 23-24, 26; Shorter Aff. 6.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    It is undisputed that PTD was the MBTA's exclusive advertising agent at all 
    times relevant to this action, and that PTD derived its authority from the 
    MBTA to post commercial and noncommercial advertisements, including advertisements 
    expressing social, political and religious messages, in MBTA facilities and 
    on MBTA buses and trains. (Shorter Dep., pp. 20, 80.)<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> <br>
    <br>
    The defendants' representation that as of January 2000, &quot;Park Transit 
    was operating under an extension to its original contract with the MBTA&quot; 
    and that &quot;the T's guidelines for advertising acceptability were contained 
    in the'Appearance and Character of Advertisements' section of the 'MBTA's 
    Specifications for Transit Advertising' dated October 15, 1999, which formed 
    part of the bid specifications for the renewal contract,&quot; at best, glosses 
    over very telling record evidence in this case,<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> and at worst, is a deliberate 
    attempt to mislead the Court. While the plaintiff agrees with the statement 
    that PTD was operating as the MBTA's exclusive advertising agent as of January 
    2000, the undisputed record evidence in this case is that the &quot;1999 Bid 
    Specs&quot; to which the defendants refer in their papers are actually specifications 
    that the MBTA entered into with another contractor, TDI, which did not go 
    into effect until July 2000 - six months after the plaintiff submitted its 
    advertisements.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> <br>
    In her deposition, Shorter at first testified that there was an &quot;extension 
    contract&quot;:<br>
    <br>
    Question: Now, you refer to a new bid spec. What was it that happened in regard 
    to the contract with Park Transit. Was it renewed or extended?<br>
    <br>
    Answer: It was extended. <br>
    Question: Was there some sort of a contract or document signed to record this 
    extension?<br>
    <br>
    Answer: By another department.<br>
    Question: But it's your understanding that some new document was signed between 
    the MBTA and Park Transit.<br>
    <br>
    (Objection.)<br>
    Question: In addition to the 1992 contract?<br>
    (Objection.)<br>
    Answer: Yes.<br>
    Plaintiff's Counsel: That hasn't been produced.<br>
    Witness: Well, it was an extension.<br>
    Plaintiff's Counsel: This is between the attorneys. <br>
    Defense Counsel: If you like, I can tell you what I think she's talking about. 
    I think it has been. Those are the 1999 bid specs. Those are what you<br>
    attach to your claim, not the 1992 bid specs. They have been produced.<br>
    <br>
    (Shorter Dep., pp. 21-22.). In the ensuing questions, Shorter ultimately admitted 
    that there was no such extension contract between Park Transit and the MBTA, 
    and that the 1999 bid specifications to which defense counsel referred at 
    deposition, and to which the defendants repeatedly refer in their summary 
    judgment papers, were, in fact, for the contract with Park Transit's successor, 
    Transport Displays, Inc., effective July 2000:<br>
    Question: Do you know whether or not a contract with these specifications 
    was ever entered into between the MBTA and Park Transit?<br>
    (Objection.)<br>
    Answer: This was put out to bid, and advertisers bid on it. And the highest 
    bidder<br>
    was awarded the contract. Unfortunately, it was not Park Transit.<br>
    <br>
    Question: It was Transport Displays, Incorporated?<br>
    Answer: Yes.<br>
    (Shorter Dep., p. 23.) (emphasis added.) While Shorter then testified that 
    at the time the bid specifications were developed, Park Transit &quot;were 
    given the updated guidelines for any work that was coming in,&quot; id. at 
    23-24, she admitted just a few answers later that this, too, was untrue:<br>
    Question: So it's your testimony that the MBTA's advertising appearance guidelines 
    were updated during the course of Park Transit's contract?<br>
    <br>
    Answer: Yes.<br>
    Question: Was there anything in writing notifying Park Transit that your guidelines<br>
    had changed?<br>
    <br>
    Answer: No.<br>
    Question: How was Park Transit informed that the guidelines had changed?<br>
    (Objection.)<br>
    Witness: I still have to answer?<br>
    Answer: They were informed, because I sent it to one of their representatives.<br>
    Question: Who did you send it to?<br>
    Answer: Elissa Albertelli.<br>
    Question: Do you know when you did that?<br>
    Answer: I don't know the exact date.<br>
    Question: Was there some letter that you sent telling Elissa Albertelli that 
    the advertising guidelines had changed?<br>
    <br>
    Answer: Well, it wasn't a letter per se. I sent her a fax, which this was 
    attached, the particular guidelines was attached.<br>
    <br>
    Question: I haven't seen that fax. Do you recall what it said.<br>
    Answer: Well, it was concerning Change the Climate. <br>
    Question: So when you sent Elissa Albertelli a fax concerning Change the Climate 
    and attached a copy of the guidelines to it, was that the first you had informed 
    her that the guidelines had changed?<br>
    <br>
    Answer: I don't recall.<br>
    (Shorter Dep., pp. 24-24) (emphasis added.). Thus, contrary to the defendants' 
    representation - by Shorter's' own testimony - there is no credible evidence 
    that any &quot;extension contract&quot; between PTD and the MBTA ever existed. 
    The actual record evidence in this case is that there was no &quot;extension 
    contract&quot; between PTD and the MBTA. Indeed, the first and only time Shorter 
    can recall notifying PTD of the &quot;updated guidelines&quot; was in her 
    January 20, 2000 fax in which she rejected the plaintiff's advertisements. 
    (Shorter Dep., pp. 24-25. See Pl. SOF at 17-18.) For the defendants' to assert 
    otherwise is a material misrepresentation of evidence and the offending statements 
    and offending portion of the Shorter affidavit should be stricken. (See Pl.

    The 1999 Bid Specs govern the sale and administration of the MBTA's advertising 
    displays. They give the MBTA's advertising agent the exclusive right to sell 
    and post advertisements for nearly all of the displays on the T's vehicles 
    and stations. (Moulton Aff. at 8 and Exh. B; 1999 Bid Specs, Article 1).) 
    <br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    For the reasons stated in Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 15, supra., this paragraph is 
    misleading. The plaintiff agrees that the 1999 bid specifications govern the 
    sale and administration of the MBTA's advertising displays currently. To the 
    extent this paragraph implies these guidelines governed the relationship between 
    the MBTA and PTD at the time the plaintiff's proposed advertisements were 
    rejected, it should be stricken. (See Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(e), (f).)<br>

    The MBTA reserves some displays for advertisements of its own choosing, for 
    a variety of purposes: to increase revenue, public travel and goodwill to 
    compensate companies that provide beneficial services to the T; and to otherwise 
    further the public interest. (Moulton Aff. at 8 and Exh. B; 1999 Bid Specs, 
    Article IX).) The MBTA also reserves the right to use unsold advertising space 
    for these same purposes. (Moulton Aff. at 8 and Exh. B (1999 Bid Specs, Article 
    X).)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    The plaintiff again points out (see Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 13, supra) that the 
    provisions defendants cite to in this paragraph have absolutely no application 
    to the plaintiff's advertisements whatsoever. The MBTA's right to &quot;reserve 
    some displays for advertisements of its own choosing&quot; (Article IX) and 
    regarding &quot;unsold advertising space&quot; (Article X) are indisputably 
    irrelevant to the issues in this case, i.e., involving advertising space available

    Advertising displays that are not sold by Park Transit and not used by the 
    T are available<br>
    at a reduced rate to government agencies and to nonprofit, tax-exempt charities. 
    (Moulton Aff. at 9 and Exh. B; 1999 Bid Specs, Article XI).) A number of restrictions 
    apply to these public service advertisements, however. Among other things, 
    only interior, 11 x 28-inch displays are available at the reduced rate, and 
    public service advertising may not be designed to influence legislation. (Moulton 
    Aff. at 10.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    Again, this paragraph constitutes an irrelevant distraction. It cites to policies 
    concerning &quot;advertising displays not sold by Park Transit and not used 
    by the T&quot; (Article XI). Although non-profit organizations seeking advertising 
    space on the MBTA system could go through the process described in Article 
    XI, they were not required to do so. The record evidence clearly shows that 
    not all public service announcements displayed on the MBTA system follow the 
    Article XI route and that some are designed to influence legislation. (See 
    Aunkst Aff., 6, 7, and 9, attached to Pl. SOF at Exhibit 6; Pl. SOF, Exhibit 
    E.) Like Articles IX and X, Article XI has absolutely no application to the 
    plaintiff's advertisements whatsoever. (See Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 13, 17, supra.)<br>

    The MBTA's Appearance and Character Guidelines provide that the MBTA will 
    not display advertisements that contain firearms or tobacco products. It will 
    not allow ads containing profanity, &quot;libelous, slanderous, or obscene&quot; 
    matter, &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;criminal&quot; content, or &quot;advertisements 
    that denigrate groups based on gender, religion, race, ethnic or political 
    affiliation.&quot; The Guidelines also warn that the MBTA - the primary school 
    transportation for thousands of schoolchildren each day - will not display 
    advertisements for materials that promote activities &quot;harmful to juveniles.&quot; 
    (Moulton Aff. at 1 and Exh. B (1999 Bid Specs, Article VII).) (A copy of the 
    Guidelines is attached to the Moulton Affidavit at Exh. B.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    This paragraph constitutes the most egregious misrepresentation of the record 
    evidence in the defendants' summary judgment papers. The Appearance and Character 
    Guidelines to which the defendants refer provide, as follows:<br>
    <br>
    The MBTA will not accept advertisements containing violent criminal content, 
    firearms, profane content, promotional materials that is [sic] harmful to 
    juveniles, and advertisements that denigrate groups based on gender, religion, 
    race, ethnic or political affiliation for display in and upon the Authority's 
    transit facilities.<br>
    <br>
    (emphasis added.) The unambiguous language of this policy cannot be mistaken. 
    Although the defendants tell the Court that the policy prohibits the display 
    of &quot;'violent' or 'criminal' content,&quot; the prohibition against those 
    advertisements &quot;containing violent criminal content&quot; is clearly 
    conjunctive. The defendants' characterization of the purported standard as 
    disjunctive materially alters the plain meaning of the policy language and 
    deliberately attempts to mislead the Court. All references to this material 
    misrepresentation should be stricken from the summary judgment record. (See 
    Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(a)(1).) <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, the actual policy prohibits &quot;promotional materials that 
    is harmful to juveniles.&quot; The defendants' paraphrasing - which butchers 
    the language of the policy - is deliberately misleading, in an attempt to 
    expand the restriction beyond its obvious commercial limitation. Furthermore, 
    whatever the policy may &quot;warn,&quot; the undisputed record evidence is 
    that the MBTA heeds no such warning. It posts advertisements for &quot;promotional 
    materials&quot; that are indisputably &quot;harmful to juveniles&quot; - alcohol 
    advertisements being the most clear example. Tellingly, nowhere in their summary 
    judgment papers do the defendants own up to this undisputed violation of the 
    purported standard.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> <br>

    Former General Manager Robert Mabardy's 1995 letter to Park Transit supplements 
    the Guidelines, and specifically focuses on advertising's effect on children 
    by making clear that the MBTA will not display material that is indecent as 
    to child viewers or frightening to children in a manner that causes them to 
    suffer physical or emotional distress. (Moulton Aff. 5 and Exh. C.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    Regardless of whether the Mabardy letter &quot;supplements the Guidelines,&quot; 
    or not, it has absolutely no application to the plaintiff's advertisements 
    at issue in this case. This is obvious from the plain language of the policy, 
    despite Prince's testimony that this was the only document he could be sure 
    did apply to the plaintiff's advertisements. For a discussion of the Mabardy

    Advertising helps create and shape peoples' perceptions. (Affidavit of Marvin

    advertising is &quot;powerful.&quot; (White Depo. at 163.) Juveniles (persons 
    between the ages of 9 and 18) are particularly susceptible to the effects 
    and influence of advertising. (Goldberg Aff. 4.) Susceptibility to peer influence

    The plaintiff agrees that &quot;advertising helps create and shape people's

    To submit an ad for consideration by the MBTA, a prospective advertiser in

    negotiated and contracted with the advertiser, determined where and when the 
    advertisements would be posted, and arranged for the display and removal of 
    advertisements. (Shorter Aff. 8.)<br>

    National Sales Manager for Park Transit from March 1997 until June 2000, testified 
    at her deposition that if a submission clearly complied with the Appearance 
    and Character Guidelines (as most submissions did), Park Transit did not forward 
    it to the MBTA. It simply posted the advertisement. (Deposition of Elissa 
    Albertelli (&quot;Albertelli Depo.&quot;) at 13-14; Shorter Aff. 10.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    The plaintiff agrees that the MBTA relied on Park Transit and its employee 
    Elissa Albertelli to make an initial determination about the acceptability 
    of the advertisements, but disagrees that the initial determination concerned 
    &quot;whether a submitted ad complied with the Appearance and Character Guidelines.&quot; 
    Albertelli testified that her decision to forward the ads to Shorter was based 
    on whether the advertisements struck her as &quot;provocative&quot; as opposed 
    to any studied application of advertising guidelines. (Albertelli Dep., pp. 
    37, 50-51.) Furthermore, the defendants omit from their rendition of the facts 
    that Albertelli later admitted in her deposition that she would never actually 
    look at the guidelines in making her decision to forward the advertisements 
    to Shorter for approval. Indeed, when asked whether she looked at the guidelines 
    when she received the plaintiff's ads, she testified &quot;No, no, no. I always

    was concerned that the advertisement did not comply with the Appearance and 
    Character Guidelines. (Albertelli Depo. at 12, 14; Shorter Aff. 10.) In such

    she was not herself responsible for approving or disapproving proposed advertisements 
    (Shorter Depo. at 1), Shorter circulated application packages to the MBTA's 
    general manager and others for a determination as to whether the ads complied 
    with the Appearance and Character Guidelines and could be accepted. (Shorter 
    Aff. 11-12.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    Regardless of whether Shorter was officially responsible for approving or 
    disapproving proposed advertisements, it is undisputed that Shorter is the 
    MBTA official who short-circuited the application process, at whatever stage 
    of the process it was, upon her review of the plaintiff's advertisements because 
    of her hostility to Change the Climate. This undisputed fact is evidenced 
    by Shorter's January 20, 2000 fax to Albertelli, attached to Pl. SOF as Exhibits 
    D and L, in which she stated her reasons for doing so:<br>
    <br>
    See attached. The Change the Climate promotes the use of marijuana in a suttle 
    [sic] way and also is really a reform marijuana [sic] in a effort to legalize? 
    The T's appearance &amp; character, Policy &amp; Drug - Alcohol policy is 
    in conflict with their mission.<br>
    <br>
    That this response short-circuited the application process is further evidenced 
    by Albertelli's own cover letter to White, dated January 24, 2000, in which, 
    attaching Shorter's fax and attachments, she informed him that the MBTA had 
    rejected Change the Climate's proposed advertisements. Consistent with the 
    Shorter fax, the cover letter Albertelli faxed to White stated:<br>
    <br>
    Regretfully, I've attached the response from the Transit Authority regarding 
    &quot;Change the Climate&quot; campaign. Their reasons for not accepting this 
    campaign are clearly stated in the info. provided. <br>
    <br>
    (emphasis added). Copies of the cover letter from Albertelli to White, dated 
    January 24, 2000, and the attachments from Shorter that she forwarded along 
    with that cover letter, are attached as Exhibits K-M to Pl. SOF. For a complete 
    discussion of this undisputed evidence, see Pl. SOF at 15-20 and Exhibits

    Since July 1997, the ultimate decision-maker on questionable advertisements 
    has been the MBTA's General Manager, Robert H. Prince, (Deposition of Robert 
    H. Prince, Jr. (&quot;Prince Depo.&quot;) at 4-5; Shorter Aff. 2.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    In light of the record evidence stated in the Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 25, supra, 
    this paragraph is immaterial to the issues in this case. More important, it 
    is misleading, as the undisputed record evidence is that in the first instance, 
    it is Albertelli who screens for questionable, or, in her own words &quot;provocative&quot; 
    advertisements to forward to Shorter's review for the next level of screening. 
    (See Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 22, supra.) It is thus undisputed that advertisements 
    that are screened out (i.e., rejected) may well never reach Prince, as was 
    the case with the plaintiff's proposed advertisements in this case. In other 
    words, while Mr. Prince may be the &quot;ultimate decisionmaker&quot; as a 
    matter of policy, the record evidence tells an entirely different story as 
    to what happens in practice.<br>

    Robert Prince never saw Joe White's Ads until well after this lawsuit was 
    commenced. (Prince Depo. at 26.) That is because Change the Climate never 
    made a formal advertising application to the MBTA. (Shorter Aff. 16, 20.)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    For the reasons stated in the Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 26, supra, this paragraph 
    is immaterial. It is undisputed that Prince never saw the ads until after 
    the lawsuit commenced because Shorter short-circuited the process. (See Pl. 
    Resp. Def. SOF, 16, supra.) Furthermore, it is undisputed that White diligently 
    followed every step of the process as was described to him by Albertelli and 
    per her instructions along the way. To the extent there was any &quot;formal&quot; 
    application process, after White expressed his frustration to Albertelli regarding 
    Shorter's lack of response on the materials he submitted in May 1999, Albertelli 
    made an application on his behalf in January 2000. (White Dep., p. 122; see 
    also Pl. SOF at 14). Shorter acknowledges receiving both the May 1999 and 
    January 2000 sets of materials and finally responded to them with her fax 
    of January 20, 2000. (See Pl. SOF at 14 n. 11; see also Shorter Aff., 17 (referring 
    to receiving materials from Albertelli &quot;that second time&quot;.) While 
    the defendants now disavow the language of that fax, the words speak for themselves. 
    (See Pl. SOF at Exhibit L.) In addition, in the words of Albertelli's own 
    fax to White on January 24, 2000 - one the defendants fail to acknowledge 
    even exists anywhere in their summary judgment papers - it was Shorter's &quot;response&quot; 
    to those materials in which she &quot;clearly stated&quot; the MBTA's &quot;reasons 
    for not accepting&quot; Change the Climate's media campaign. (See Pl. SOF 
    at Exhibit K.) <br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, the defendants' statement in footnote 6 of their statement of 
    facts that &quot;there is no question, however, that had the Ads been formally 
    resubmitted without change, the MBTA would have rejected them&quot; constitutes 
    a key admission. By this statement, the defendants admit that in order for 
    the MBTA to deem the plaintiff's advertisements acceptable, the plaintiff 
    would have to change the content of the advertisements.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> For a discussion

    White did have several preliminary conversations with Park Transit's Albertelli 
    about his proposed advertising campaign, which he twice described to her as 
    &quot;provocative.&quot; (White Depo. at 67, 85.) He first met Albertelli 
    in person in May, 1999, when he asked her about the process for placing ads 
    on the T. (White Depo. at 84-85.) He submitted the three proposed Ads to her 
    around January 4, 2000. (White Depo. at 123-124.) When Albertelli reviewed 
    the Ads, she questioned whether they complied with the MBTA's Appearance and 
    Character Guidelines. (Albertelli Depo. at 26, 42.) She therefore sent them 
    to Lucy Shorter for her informal review and comment. (Shorter Depo.: at 35-36, 
    39, 41; Albertelli Depo. at 23.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    Plaintiff agrees that White had several conversations as well as a meeting 
    with Albertelli at the Charles Hotel and agrees that the plaintiff may have 
    described the campaign as provocative. The defendants fails to acknowledge 
    the record evidence that, as a result of these conversations and the face 
    to face meeting, in which White shared with Albertelli materials on the plaintiff 
    organization and media campaign, Albertelli understood that the campaign was 
    politically provocative. Albertelli recalls that White told her that Change 
    the Climate was &quot;definitely looking to educate, as he put it, the public&quot;on 
    marijuana issues. (Albertelli Dep., pp. 17, 40; see also Pl. SOF at 12-13.) 
    The plaintiff also notes that White submitted materials to Albertelli and 
    Shorter prior to January 4, 2000, by both officials' own testimony. (Shorter

    full-sized ones), and it did not indicate the date the campaign was to begin, 
    the duration of the campaign, or the total value of the campaign. (Albertelli

    It is undisputed that unprescribed marijuana use is unlawful, and therefore 
    harmful to juveniles. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; &sect;31 and 34. At 
    his deposition, Joe White admitted that marijuana is unhealthy and harmful 
    to juveniles. &quot;As a parent, I just wouldn't want my kid smoking marijuana 
    ... [because I would want them focusing on healthy activities academics, school, 
    sports - and not doing things that may be unhealthy for them.&quot; (White 
    Depo. at 4O-41.) White testified that&quot; it's a fact that marijuana is 
    illegal. You can go to jail. There are other potential harms that might come 
    to kids or other people who smoke pot.&quot; (White Depo. at 152.) He further 
    testified, &quot;Change the Climate's position is that smoking pot is not 
    appropriate for kids, and that says it all. We, Change the Climate, would 
    not have and would not propose an advertisement that said smoking pot is okay 
    in any fashion.&quot; (White Depo. at 155-156.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    The plaintiff disagrees with the defendants' bald assertion in the first sentence 
    of this paragraph that because something is unlawful, it is therefore harmful. 
    Indeed, to accept the defendants' flawed logical premise is to agree that 
    law reform efforts aimed at, for example, putting an end to the Jim Crow laws 
    or ending Prohibition, or allowing women the right to vote, or decriminalizing 
    abortion, were all &quot;harmful&quot; to society because they advocated the 
    changing of existing laws. The defendants' assertion should be stricken from 
    the record as an unreasonable inference unsupported in the record evidence. 
    (See Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(g).)<br>
    <br>
    The plaintiff agrees that Change the Climate's position is that smoking marijuana

    It was evident to Lucy Shorter that the Advertisements, which appeared to 
    be directed at juveniles, promoted marijuana use. In her view, they violated 
    the Appearance and Character Guidelines' prohibition of advertising that is 
    harmful to juveniles and that encourages criminal conduct. (Shorter Depo. 
    at 36-37, 39, 41-43, 52, 71-72, 77-78.) She also believed that by promoting 
    drug use, the Advertisements appeared to conflict with the MBTA's Drug-Free 
    Workplace policy. (Shorter Depo. at 71-72.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    Again, this paragraph contains the material misrepresentation of evidence 
    discussed in the Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 19, supra. The Appearance and Character 
    Guidelines' do not prohibit advertising encouraging &quot;criminal conduct&quot; 
    but rather purport to prohibit &quot;violent criminal content.&quot; (See 
    Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(a),(g).)<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, the paragraph contains another telling misrepresentation of 
    record evidence. While the defendants include pages 39 and 41-43 of Shorter's 
    deposition, they omit reference to page 40, where Shorter is asked about her 
    fax to Albertelli. This document, one which the defendants do not include 
    as an exhibit to their statement of facts, evidences that Shorter's view of 
    what violated the guidelines at that time was Change the Climate's mission.

    Shorter's view is one that is shared by others. The principal of Boston Latin

    that the Ads encourage the use of marijuana. She states in her affidavit that 
    she would not display the Ads on Boston Latin school property, and would not

    points out that in The Boston Herald articles to which the defendants refer 
    the plaintiff's organization is mischaracterized, the advertisements at issue 
    are misquoted, and the myth of marijuana as a gateway to other drugs is asserted 
    as a &quot;well known&quot; fact without basis.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> The plaintiff is also compelled 
    to point out that The Boston Herald stands alone in its irrational, fear-monger 
    interpretation of the plaintiff's ads and mission and its award of kudos to 
    Governor Cellucci's support of the MBTA's conduct. Various publications across 
    the nation have weighed in with different interpretations of the plaintiff 
    organization and its media campaign; all are uniformly critical of the MBTA's 
    decision. Indeed, most recently, The Boston Phoenix awarded Cellucci a &quot;Muzzle 
    Award&quot; for his &quot;latest transgression against free speech,&quot; 
    quoting Cellucci's highly politicized press release to The Boston Herald upon 
    learning of the law suit. A copy of The Boston Phoenix article is attached 
    hereto as Exhibit B, as are articles by The New York Daily News (&quot;The 
    ads don't encourage people to smoke, but rather encourage decriminalization 
    of marijuana and its use as a medicine.&quot;), The Washington Post (&quot;The

    In addition, the MBTA has submitted with this motion the expert testimony 
    of Pennsylvania State University Prof. Marvin E. Goldberg, Ph.D., who has 
    extensive experience, training and research in the fields of advertising and 
    marketing. According to Prof. Goldberg, the Ads send juveniles the messages 
    that &quot;using marijuana is okay&quot; or &quot;it is not a big deal.&quot; 
    (Affidavit of Marvin E. Goldberg, Ph.D. (&quot;Goldberg Aff.&quot;) 4.) Specifically, 
    juveniles are likely to take from the Teen Ad the messages that attractive 
    and &quot;cool&quot; peers and role models have used marijuana, &quot;many 
    other juveniles are thinking about using marijuana,&quot; only &quot;stupid&quot; 
    people would take seriously the fact that the drug is illegal, and &quot;marijuana 
    isn't so bad.&quot; (Goldberg Aff. 17-21.) Juveniles are likely to take from 
    the Police Ad the message that marijuana users are not real criminals, that 
    using marijuana won't get you in trouble, and that police will not enforce 
    anti-marijuana laws. (Goldberg Aff. 18 and 22.) Juveniles are likely to take 
    from the Mother Ad the messages that &quot;many juveniles use marijuana...... 
    using marijuana is hardly dangerous at all,&quot; even mothers are resigned 
    to the prospect of their children smoking marijuana and parents do not seriously 
    oppose its use. (Goldberg Aff. 19 and 23.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    As explained fully in Pl. Motion to Strike, because the Goldberg affidavit 
    does not meet the helpfulness requirement under Rule Fed. R. Evid. 702, on 
    the ground that the Court can read the advertisements itself, and on the ground 
    that the testimony in the affidavit alters the advertisements' plain language, 
    the affidavit should be stricken from the summary judgment record as inadmissible.

    Similarly, Herbert D. Kleber, M.D., a professor of psychiatry and the director 
    of the Division on Substance Abuse at the College of Physicians and Surgeons 
    of Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, has offered 
    expert testimony that the Ads promote marijuana use among juveniles. (Affidavit 
    of Herbert D. Kleber, M.D. (&quot;Kleber Aff.&quot;) 4.) Specifically, the 
    Police Ad suggests that using marijuana is not a &quot;real&quot; crime, and 
    implies that using marijuana will not result in criminal penalties, thus lessening 
    perceived risk and subtly promoting marijuana use. (Kleber Aff. 8.) The Teen 
    Ad subtly promotes marijuana use by suggesting that juveniles are knowledgeable 
    about and comfortable with marijuana use. (Kleber Aff. 5.) The Mother Ad subtly 
    promotes marijuana use by sending the message to juveniles that many of their 
    peers are using marijuana, and that even mothers are resigned to the prospect 
    of their children smoking marijuana. (Kleber Aff. 6.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    Because the Kleber affidavit likewise fails to meet the helpfulness requirement

    Adolescence is a critical age for making decisions about marijuana use. Juveniles 
    are particularly susceptible to messages promoting marijuana use because juveniles, 
    more than other age groups, are searching for cues regarding marijuana use. 
    (Kleber Aff. 2.) As compared to other age groups, juveniles are particularly 
    at risk for initiation of marijuana use. (Kleber Aff. 2.) Research shows that 
    the risk that a person will begin using marijuana rises throughout that person's 
    adolescence up until age 18. After age 18, the risk that a person will start 
    using marijuana steadily declines. If a person does not begin using marijuana 
    by the time he or she has turned 21, it is unlikely that person will do so.

    Marijuana usage by one's peers and, even more so, the perception of marijuana 
    use by peers, are strong predictors of initiation of marijuana use. (Goldberg 
    Aff. 5.) Research shows that the perception of marijuana use by one's peers 
    is a strong predictor of whether one will begin using marijuana. Juveniles 
    who have the perception - accurately or inaccurately - that their peers use 
    marijuana are more likely to do so themselves.<br>
    (Kleber Aff. 3.) The perceived level of risk associated with using marijuana 
    is also a lead indicator predictive of actual level of use among high school 
    students. (Goldberg Aff. 6.) Juveniles are sensitive to messages about the 
    harms associated with marijuana use. Trend analyses of drug use beliefs and 
    behaviors over the past two decades indicate that increases in drug use rates 
    are associated with a decline in the perception that drugs are harmful, and 
    vice versa. (Kleber Aff. 7.)<br>

    Prof Goldberg testified in his affidavit that the Teen Ad conveys the messages 
    that &quot;many other juveniles are actively deliberating the merits of marijuana&quot; 
    and that &quot;marijuana isn't so bad.&quot; (Goldberg Aff. 7.) For several 
    reasons, it is particularly likely to command the attention of adolescents 
    and to be persuasive to adolescents. Portraying an adolescent wearing a baseball 
    cap worn backwards is a highly effective way of quickly telegraphing a message 
    to other adolescents, and generates a sense of similarity between the spokesperson 
    and the audience, which is a very powerful device in gaining the attention 
    of, and persuading, a target audience. (Goldberg Aff. 7(a).) The easily recognizable 
    colloquial language used by the adolescent spokesperson, which mimics adolescent 
    speech (&quot;we're not stupid, ya know&quot;), is also likely to attract 
    the attention of adolescents. (Goldberg Aff. 7(b).)<br>

    teen spokesperson's cohort that is knowledgeable about marijuana usage and/or 
    agree with and support the advertisement's message. (Goldberg Aff. 7(c).) 
    The underlined and capitalized word &quot;NOT&quot; in the second line of 
    text makes the second line of text more likely to be noticed and remembered 
    than the first line, which contains the cautionary statement that &quot;marijuana 
    is not cool.&quot; (Goldberg Aff. 7(d).) Words in larger print, and sentences 
    that are shorter, will be noticed more quickly and are more likely to be remembered. 
    (Goldberg Aff. 7(d).) Finally, juveniles are likely to process this ad using 
    a simplifying heuristic that there is one positive and one negative statement 
    regarding marijuana, and conclude that, on balance, &quot;marijuana isn't 
    so bad.&quot; (Goldberg Aff. 7(e).)<br>

    Prof Goldberg testifies in his affidavit that the structure of the Mother 
    Ad is effective in communicating the messages that &quot;many juveniles use 
    marijuana,&quot; and &quot;using marijuana is not that dangerous.&quot; (Goldberg 
    Aff. 9.) The figure is identified in the text of the advertisement as a mother, 
    and also appears at a glance to be a teacher standing at a chalkboard. (Goldberg 
    Aff. 9(a).) The mother's statement in the advertisement, &quot;I don't want 
    them to smoke pot. But. . . &quot; conveys a message to juveniles that even 
    mothers are resigned to the fact that their children will smoke marijuana. 
    (Goldberg Aff. 9(a).) This conveys the impression to juveniles that many of 
    their peers are using marijuana, and that use of marijuana is not particularly 
    serious. (Goldberg Aff. 9(a).) Juveniles are adept at picking up verbal or 
    nonverbal qualifiers. (Goldberg Aff. 9(b).) The final statement is just such 
    a qualifier, suggesting that marijuana use, though perhaps not desirable, 
    is more or less inevitable. (Goldberg Aff. 9(b).)<br>

    According to Prof. Goldberg, the statement in the advertisement that &quot;jail 
    is a lot more dangerous than smoking pot&quot; is not likely to be fully understood 
    by juveniles, particularly juveniles who process it only partially. (Goldberg 
    Aff. 5(c).) The likely take-away from this advertisement is not that smoking 
    &quot;pot&quot; - the vernacular term that is more accessible to juveniles 
    than &quot;marijuana&quot; - is less dangerous than jail, but the simpler 
    message that smoking pot is hardly dangerous at all. (Goldberg Aff. 9(c).) 
    That message is at odds with the elemental truth that smoking marijuana is 
    against the law, and carries the danger of arrest, fines, incarceration, and 
    other ill effects. (Goldberg Aff. 9(c).)<br>

    Prof. Goldberg also states in his affidavit that the structure of the Police 
    Ad is particularly effective in encouraging the reader to draw the inference 
    that marijuana users are not real criminals and thus would not be sought after 
    by police. (Goldberg Aff. 8.) Using the eye catching background of an oversized 
    American flag, this advertisement will be understood by many juveniles to 
    be endorsed by the police (including perhaps the MBTA police). (Goldberg Aff. 
    8(a).) It draws upon two powerful symbols of authority, police officers and 
    the American flag. (Goldberg Aff. 8(a).) This advertisement downplays the 
    penalties associated with marijuana by suggesting that police do not consider 
    marijuana to be a &quot;real&quot; crime and that police consider prosecution 
    of offenders on marijuana charges to be a &quot;waste&quot; of &quot;valuable&quot; 
    police resources. (Goldberg Aff.118(b).) It thereby encourages juveniles to 
    engage in behaviors that will cause them harm - to wit, arrest, fines, criminal 
    record, and/or incarceration, among other harms. (Goldberg Aff. 8(b).)<br>

    On or about January 20, 2000, Ms. Shorter communicated her assessment of the 
    Ads to Park Transit's Albertelli in a hastily written fax, to which she attached 
    a copy of the Appearance and Character Guidelines and the Drug-Free Workplace 
    policy. The Change the Climate ad campaign, she wrote, &quot;promotes the 
    use of marijuana in a subtle way.&quot; (Shorter Depo. at 38-40, 42, 44.) 
    <br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    Here, the defendants omit reference to material record evidence, Shorter's 
    January 20, 2000 fax, and then paraphrase that evidence to mean something 
    other than what is plain from the language of the fax in blatant violation 
    of the best evidence rule. While Shorter testified at her deposition in April 
    2001 that she believed the advertisements were in conflict with the guidelines, 
    Shorter's damning fax - written at the time of her decision in January 2000 
    without the benefit of defense counsel - stated her then-view that the MBTA's 
    policies were in conflict with Change the Climate's mission. Once again, the 
    fax, in its entirety, states: <br>
    <br>
    See attached. The Change the Climate promotes the use of marijuana in a suttle 
    [sic] way and also is really a reform marijuana [sic] in a effort to legalize? 
    The T's appearance &amp; character, Policy &amp; Drug - Alcohol policy is 
    in conflict with their mission.<br>
    <br>
    (See Pl. SOF at 15-16 and Exhibit L.) Thus, contrary to the defendants' representation, 
    the fax does not state that the ad campaign promotes the use of marijuana; 
    it states that Shorter's opinion that the plaintiff organization, which Shorter 
    even labeled a &quot;reform effort,&quot; promotes marijuana use. Furthermore, 
    the defendants omit material portions of the fax that evidence Shorter's hostility 
    to the plaintiff's organization and reform effort, namely the portion of the 
    fax that states that Change the Climate's mission is in conflict with the 
    MBTA guidelines and policies she attached to the fax. For the defendants to 
    make reference to the Shorter fax without actually attaching it to their statement 
    of facts when it is available offends basic evidentiary principles and summary 
    judgment practice; to further misrepresent its contents through incomplete 
    and misleading paraphrasing is egregious. The paragraph should be stricken. 
    (See Pl. Motion to Strike, 5(b),(g).) The plaintiff directs the Court to the 
    fax itself, attached as Exhibits D and L to the plaintiff's SOF, for the actual 
    record evidence in this case. <br>
    <br>
    Nor is there any record evidence supporting the defendants' tacit suggestion 
    that had Shorter not acted &quot;hastily&quot; and given the application more 
    thought, she would have accepted the plaintiff's advertisements. In fact, 
    defendants' statement in footnote 6 of their statement of facts that &quot;there 
    is no question, however, that had the Ads been formally resubmitted without 
    change, the MBTA would have rejected them&quot; directly contradicts that 
    suggestion. <br>

    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Defendants' SOF: 
    <br>
    Shorter did not circulate the Advertisements to higher-ups at the MBTA because 
    she did not understand them to have been formally submitted to her for display 
    on MBTA facilities. (Shorter Aff. 6.) General Manager Prince played no role 
    in Shorter's review of the Advertisements or her response to Albertelli. (Prince 
    Depo. at 52.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    Shorter short-circuited the application process for the reasons she stated 
    in her fax of January 20, 2000. (See Exhibits K and L attached to Pl. SOF.) 
    Prince's role in Shorter's review of the plaintiff's advertisements is immaterial. 
    (See Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 25-27, supra.) What is material and undisputed, however, 
    is that (1) the MBTA officials' conduct at issue in this case was under Prince's 
    watch as General Manager; and (2) Prince could not be sure what advertising 
    policies were in place and in effect at the time the plaintiff submitted its 
    advertisements, or at any other time for that matter. For highlights of Prince's 
    broken-field testimony regarding the various policies, see Pl. SOF at 17 n. 
    13, 22 n. 17, and 26 n. 21. <br>

    Shorter testified at deposition that when she scrawled her assessment of the 
    Ads in the fax to Albertelli, she was simply &quot;trying to move the document 
    off [her] desk.&quot; (Shorter Depo. at 40.) At deposition, she also clarified 
    that when she wrote that &quot;their mission&quot; violated T policies, she 
    was referring to the mission of the Advertisements - promoting the unlawful 
    use of marijuana - not the mission of Change the Climate. (Shorter Depo. at 
    59-62.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response:<br>
    The first sentence of this paragraph is immaterial. See 43, supra. There is 
    no record evidence supporting the defendants' tacit suggestion that had Shorter 
    not acted &quot;hastily&quot; and given the application more thought, she 
    would have accepted the plaintiff's advertisements. In fact, defendants' statement 
    in footnote 6 of their statement of facts that &quot;there is no question, 
    however, that had the Ads been formally resubmitted without change, the MBTA 
    would have rejected them&quot; directly contradicts that suggestion. <br>
    <br>
    The second sentence of this paragraph should be stricken. Shorter's deposition 
    testimony (acknowledging the &quot;their&quot; pronoun in her fax referred 
    to Change the Climate) and not defense counsel's inappropriate counseling 
    (&quot;She answered it, their campaign mission&quot;) is the record evidence 
    in this case. (Shorter Dep., pp. 61.) No contrivance can alter the meaning 
    of her words. Advertisements do not have missions. Organizations do. For a 
    discussion of this record evidence, see Pl. SOF at 33. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Defendants' SOF: 
    <br>
    Both Albertelli and Shorter testified unequivocally that Shorter's fax did 
    not formally reject the Advertisements (Shorter Depo. at 56; Albertelli Depo. 
    at 30-3 1), and plaintiff can offer no evidence to the contrary. [Footnote 
    6: There is no question, however, that had the Ads been formally resubmitted 
    without change, the MBTA would have rejected them. Because the Ads promote 
    marijuana use to juveniles - and thereby encourage unlawful conduct that will 
    harm those juveniles - they violate the MBTA's Appearance and Character Guidelines.] 
    (Prince Depo. at 27-32.) The fax from Shorter to Albertelli was not in the 
    form in which Park Transit typically received a formal rejection of an advertising 
    submission; it was not &quot;by any means a final reply or decision about 
    Change the Climate's advertising executions.&quot; (Albertelli Depo. at 57, 
    59.) Shorter testified at deposition that when she sent her note, she expected 
    that Albertelli would advise Joe White to design an ad that conformed to the 
    MBTA Appearance and Character Guidelines, and that the Advertisements would 
    be resubmitted, at which point Ms. Shorter would circulate them for a final 
    decision. (Shorter Depo. at 38-40, 42, 44.) Such a give-and-take process had 
    occurred on other occasions, and typically resulted in a dialogue between 
    Park Transit and the MBTA, resulting in the creation of ads that fall within 
    the Guidelines. (Albertelli Depo. at 37.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    This paragraph is immaterial for the reasons stated in the Pl. Resp. Def. 
    SOF, 25, 27 and 45, supra. The defendants' assertion that the plaintiff &quot;can 
    offer no evidence&quot; to contradict the self-serving testimony of Albertelli 
    and Shorter denies the existence of the two pieces of documentary evidence 
    that do precisely that. (See Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 25 and 31, supra.) Again, 
    the defendants' omission of the faxes of Shorter and Albertelli in their rendition 
    of facts constitutes a material misrepresentation of evidence on the part 
    of the defendants. <br>
    <br>
    It bears repeating that the defendants' statement in footnote 6, that &quot;there 
    is no question, however, that had the Ads been formally resubmitted without 
    change, the MBTA would have rejected them,&quot; constitutes a key admission 
    by the defendants that in order for the MBTA to deem the plaintiff's advertisements 
    acceptable, the plaintiff would have to change the content of the advertisements. 
    <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Defendants' SOF: 
    <br>
    This was Ms. Albertelli's understanding as well; she thought Change the Climate 
    would revise the Advertisements and submit new versions, &quot;like any other 
    client would have.&quot; (Albertelli Depo. at 31.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    Again, Albertelli's understanding of the fax at the time she received it is 
    evidenced by the material piece of evidence that the defendants' omitted from 
    their rendition of facts - the January 24, 2000 cover letter from Albertelli 
    to White, in which Albertelli wrote:<br>
    <br>
    Regretfully, I've attached the response from the Transit Authority regarding 
    &quot;Change the Climate&quot; campaign. Their reasons for not accepting this 
    campaign are clearly stated in the info provided. <br>
    <br>
    (emphasis added). (See Pl. SOF, Exhibit K; Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 25, 27 and 
    46, supra.) Again, the defendants' failure to include Albertelli's fax to 
    White in their rendition of facts constitutes a misleading and most telling 
    omission: Albertelli's &quot;understanding,&quot; as the fax plainly reads, 
    was that the MBTA's &quot;reasons for not accepting this campaign&quot; were 
    &quot;clearly stated in the info provided&quot; (the &quot;info&quot; referring 
    to the polices that Shorter had faxed to Albertelli, which Albertelli, in 
    turn, forwarded to White with this cover letter). The defendants can produce 
    no evidence - because no such evidence exists - showing that anyone at PTD 
    or the MBTA informed White that further avenues of review were available. 
    In addition, there is no record evidence that there was any formal rejection 
    procedure between the MBTA and PTD. For evidence to the contrary, see Pl. 
    SOF at 29 n.24.<br>

    But Joe White responded differently. He did not ask for clarification from 
    Park Transit or the MBTA. He did not submit a formal application. He did not 
    insist that the MBTA formally consider his submission. Instead, Joe White's 
    entity, Change the Climate, filed this federal lawsuit. (Shorter Aff. 21.)<br>
    <br>
    Plaintiff's Response: <br>
    For the reasons stated in Pl. Resp. Def. SOF, 25, supra., this paragraph is 
    immaterial. Again, it is undisputed that there was no appeal process in place 
    by which White could appeal Shorter's decision, and the reasons for her rejection 
    were crystal clear.<br>

    The complete set of documents is, however, attached to Pl. SOF as Exhibit

    five pages, including the cover sheet. Exhibit A of Shorter's affidavit omits 
    two of the four policies she attached to her January 20, 2000 fax to Albertelli 
    - specifically, the sections of the bid specifications that indisputably apply 
    to bidders, not advertisers. (See Pl. SOF at 15-20 and Exhibits L, N and P.) 
    These material omissions are themselves evidence of what the plaintiff has

    withdrawn by advertisers after the MBTA raised initial objections,&quot; see
