  2002-12-22 -- So often in drug policy a germ of an idea starts with one regular 
  person, and one public official or another at the other end of the spectrum 
  who could actually make positive policy changes happen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In this case a USENET 
  poster named Dave recently wanted to know how many people are really behind 
  bars for marijuana offenses in the United States? And on the other end are public 
  officials such as DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson who claimed on CNN's Crossfire 
  &quot;What I'm saying is that obviously it's another myth that we're locking 
  up all the [marijuana] users and they're filling up our prisons. That's not 
  the case. You still have to work pretty hard to get into prison for drug use 
  today.&quot;(aa) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">This report, the first 
  of two parts, illustrates how such a claim is not very believable. If one wanted 
  to take all currently incarcerated felony marijuana offenders to a ball game 
  they could fill two large sports stadiums. For instance, the Texas Stadium which 
  houses the Dallas Cowboys and Ford Field, which hosts the Detroit Lions at 65,846 
  and 65,000 respectively.(ab) (Chart-1) To treat just the prisoners currently 
  behind bars for felony possession only to a ball game you could fill all 50,000 
  seats at Trice Field, home of the Iowa State Cyclones.(ac) </font></p>

  This analysis goes well beyond what we already know of the arrests for marijuana 
  each year. (Chart-2) The FBI Uniform Crime Report puts that number at 723,626 
  for 2001(ad), a slight decrease from 734,648 the year before. Following the

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Here we are going to 
  look at who is really currently behind bars for state felony and federal marijuana 
  offenses. How many are under lock and key preceding trial and sentencing at 
  any given time for marijuana offenses? How many are in local jails, state prisons 
  and probation and how much does all this cost? (Chart-3) How much do the initial 
  arrests cost? This analysis relies heavily on data from the US Bureau of Justice

  </font><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial"> <b>Overview </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Let's first get an idea 
  of the scope of the American prison population. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Overall, the United 
  States incarcerated 2,071,686 persons at yearend 2000.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">This includes Federal, 
  State and territorial prisons, local and Indian country jails, INS, military 
  and juvenile facilities. Current US drug policy continues to heavily fuel federal 
  inmate populations: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Prisoners sentenced 
  for drug offenses constitute the largest group of Federal inmates (61%) in 1999, 
  up from 53% in 1990. On September 30, 1999, the date of the latest available 
  data in the Federal Justice Statistics Program, Federal prisons held 68,360 
  sentenced drug offenders, compared to 30,470 at yearend 1990.&quot;(ad) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">According to the Sentencing 
  Project, &quot;The U.S. rate of incarceration is generally 5-8 times that of 
  comparable industrialized nations such as Canada and the countries of western 
  Europe.&quot;(ae) Currently it stands at 699 per 100,000 population while the 
  nearest nation Russia, is at 644. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>$500 Million Per Year 
  for Incarceration Costs</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Between 1984 and 
  1999, the number of defendants charged with a drug offense in the Federal courts 
  increased from 11,854 to 29,306. Of the 38,288 suspects referred to U.S. attorneys 
  during 1999, 31% were involved with marijuana; 28%, cocaine powder; 15%, crack 
  cocaine; 15%, methamphetamine; 7%, opiates; and 3%, other drugs.&quot; (<a href="http://bbsnews.net/bbsnphotos/faqlet-charts/fed-referred99.jpg" target="_blank">Chart-4</a>) 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;During 1999 criminal 
  cases involving 28,432 defendants charged with a drug offense were concluded 
  in U.S. district courts; 89% of defendants charged were convicted. ...About 
  60% of drug defendants adjudicated were detained between arrest and adjudication.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Which would yield 25,304 
  total drug convictions. Federal convictions for marijuana offenses therefore 
  resulted in about 8,162 marijuana cases or 31% of the total. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Nearly 9 in 10 
  of those convicted of a drug offense received a sentence that included imprisonment, 
  8% were sentenced to a term of probation, and 3% received another type of sentence 
  such as a fine. The average prison term imposed during 1999 was 74 months.&quot;(1a) 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The report quoted above 
  also makes note that federal prisoners are required to serve 87% of their sentence. 
  That would work out to about 64 months. But the report also states elsewhere 
  that &quot;By contrast, those involved with marijuana received the shortest 
  sentences, on average -- 34 months.&quot; Using the lower figure and given that 
  these offenders will likely have to serve about 87% of their sentence, they 
  will probably serve about two and a half years. Meaning that even as 8,162 people 
  went to prison for felony marijuana charges in 1999 they were still there when 
  the year 2000 crop came in and so on. It is fair to conclude then that there 
  are at least as many as 24,488 in federal prison currently for marijuana offenses 
  from based upon what was occuring during the years 1999-2001. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Federal inmates also 
  cost more to house, $22,174(1b) each, as compared to state/local populations. 
  This federal detention of marijuana offenders over 1999-2001 cost over a half 
  a billion dollars per year or $542,996,912. It cost more than $1.5 billion dollars 
  to pay for housing more than 8000 inmates per year over the cumulative cycle 
  of their incarceration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The BJS reported in a 
  1998 Bulletin, Felony Sentences in State Courts, &quot;A total of 927,717 persons 
  were convicted of a felony in State courts in 1998, including 164,600 (or 17.8% 
  of the total) for a violent felony; 283,000 (30.5%) for the property offenses 
  of burglary, larceny, fraud, and forgery; 314,600 (33.9%) for drug offenses; 
  and 31,900 (3.4%) for weapon offenses. The remaining 133,600 (14.4%) consisted 
  of persons convicted of nonviolent offenses such as receiving stolen property 
  and escaping custody. (<a href="http://bbsnews.net/bbsnphotos/faqlet-charts/felon-convicted98.jpg" target="_blank">Chart-5</a>) 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Marijuana trafficking

  were 3.6% of the total.&quot; (<a href="http://bbsnews.net/bbsnphotos/faqlet-charts/mj-state-inmates98.jpg" target="_blank">Chart-6</a>) 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Meaning 23,192 for marijuana 
  trafficking (which often translates as gardening) and 33,397 felony convictions 
  for marijuana possession for a total of 56,589 total felony marijuana convictions 
  in state courts in 1998. 44% of drug offenders are sentenced to state prison 
  meaning about 24,899 total marijuana offenders likely go to prison each year. 
  The average drug sentence to prison was almost five years in 1998 yet according 
  to the same report: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Felons convicted 
  in State courts served a significantly smaller proportion of their total incarceration 
  sentence. For instance, State prisoners (not including felons sentenced to jail) 
  served about 47% of their total prison sentence in 1998.(2a)&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Showing that when 1999's 
  intake of convicted marijuana offenders were sentenced, the prior years intake 
  were already incarcerated and serving out their time, which was likely to be 
  about two years or less than half, or 47% of the average sentence being served. 
  When 2000's intake arrived those convicted in 1998 were still finishing up their 
  time meaning as many as 75,000 felony marijuana inmates could conceivably be 
  incarcerated currently in state prisons alone. With drug prosecutions on the 
  rise, it's not likely this number has decreased. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Another 13,581 marijuana 
  offenders are sentenced to local jail for stays of a year or less. The average 
  time served in jail for such offenses usually being about 6 months. On average 
  one could expect about half that total number being held in jail at any given 
  time for a total of nearly 82,000 adults currently incarcerated in jails and 
  state prisons for marijuana offenses. This brings the total likely number to 
  local, state and federal inmates currently under detention for marijuana offenses 
  at yearend 2000 to 106,278. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">About 15,000 in 1998 
  were serving time for possession alone. Which indicate about 45,000 adults are 
  currently serving time for possession alone in state prisons with probably about 
  4,000 in local jails. Nearly 50,000 people are likely currently incarcerated 
  for marijuana possession alone in state prisons and local jails. The average 
  cost of housing such an inmate is $16,600(2b) each. Meaning as much as $1.36 
  billion dollars is spent each year to pay for marijuana offenders in local and 
  state facilities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">It's likely that a number 
  of defendants in marijuana cases are currently in jail awaiting trial or sentencing. 
  Not all get out on bail or a personal recognizance bond. From a BJS report using 
  data from 40 of the 75 most populous counties: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;From 1992 to 1998, 
  the proportion of drug defendants increased from 30% to 37%. During this period, 
  the percentage of defendants charged with a property crime decreased from 35% 
  to 29%. The proportion of defendants charged with a public-order offense has 
  remained at just under 1 in 10.(4a)&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Which suggests that law 
  enforcement resources may have shifted away from property crime more towards 
  drug crime. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;For about 3 in 
  8 defendants, the most serious arrest charge was a drug offense (37.1%). Nearly 
  half (48%) of drug defendants were charged with drug trafficking. Overall, defendants 
  were more likely to be charged with drug trafficking (17.7%) or other drug offenses 
  (19.4%) than any other type of offense.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Using BJS statistics 
  above which show 56,589 defendants in 1998 were convicted of marijuana offenses; 
  and relying on the pre trial report referenced below: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Of the defendants 
  who had State felony charges filed against them in the Nation's 75 most populous 
  counties during May 1998 - Thirty-six percent were detained until case disposition, 
  including 7% who were denied bail.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Suggesting about 12,022 
  state marijuana possession defendants and 8,349 marijuana trafficking defendants 
  for a total of 20,371 are spending time behind bars prior to and regardless 
  of case disposition in 1998. The stay for those released prior to trial and 
  or sentencing is one day or less for about half of those released, within one 
  week for 8 out of ten and the remaining 20% will be released within the month. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The report also states: 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;For 54% of felony 
  defendants in the 75 largest counties, adjudication of their case occurred within 
  3 months of arrest, and 75% of cases were adjudicated within 6 months of arrest. 
  By the end of the 1-year study period, 90% of all cases had been adjudicated.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">This finding indicates 
  that thousands of marijuana possession defendants each year go through the arrest 
  and period of incarceration awaiting release if one can make bail and then they 
  may wait as long as 6 months or even a year to learn their final sentencing 
  outcome. Regardless if final sentencing resulted in probation, a substantial 
  number of marijuana defendants, thousands of them, get a de facto jail sentence. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">There were probably 20,000 
  persons were under correctional supervision awaiting trial for felony marijuana 
  offenses in 1998. Considering that about half will have their case disposed 
  of within 90 days, we could conservatively divide the annual cost of housing

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">If we use the conviction 
  rate for marijuana possession and trafficking as indicated above for a baseline 
  we can arrive at a plausible approximation of how many people are serving probation 
  for marijuana offenses. 24% of adults on probation comes to 989,418. Taking 
  2.5% and 3.6% of those on probation for marijuana trafficking and possession 
  respectively, we find 35,619 for possession and 24,735 for trafficking for a 
  total of 60,354 people under community supervision. At an annual cost per marijuana 
  offender of $1066(*) each, those on probation in 1998 cost $64,337,364 to supervise. 
  Spanning the years from 1998-2001, probation for marijuana offenses added an 
  additional cost of $257 million. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Or, looked at in another 
  way: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">32% of state drug convictions 
  resulted in probation. Based on the percentages derived from the conviction 
  rate, the number of marijuana cases that went straight to probation would likely 
  have been about 10,687. Using the same formula, possibly as many as 7421 to 
  probation for marijuana trafficking. The average length of probation is 3 years 
  4 months so it's possible as many as 54,000 adults were under probational supervision 
  mid-year 2001 for marijuana convictions starting from 1998. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">As many as 32,000 adults 
  are on state imposed probation for marijuana possession alone. Which actually 
  seems low given that in 1998 about one quarter of the 4,000,000 adults under 
  supervision had a drug law violation and marijuana is the most commonly used 
  currently illicit drug in the United States. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The average cost of community

  Due to Incarceration </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>$4.2 Billion Lost 
  For 2002 </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Contributed by Brian 
  Bennett </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">For many years the U.S. 
  Office of National Drug Control Policy has justified waging drugwar based in 
  part on the societal &quot;costs&quot; of illegal drug use. The greatest of 
  these costs are attributed to &quot;lost productivity&quot; which is said to 
  account for $110.5 billion (or 69 percent) of the $160.66 billion 2000 estimated 
  total costs. This cost categorization is comprised of (among other things), 
  premature death ($18 billion) and the cost of hospitalization and instutionalization 
  of drug users ($1.9 billion). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The largest chunk of 
  these lost productivity costs however, is that attributed to being incarcerated 
  which accounts for 32 percent of the total costs attributed to &quot;lost productivity.&quot; 
  People who are incarcerated are no longer able to earn a living and the monies 
  thus lost to society in this manner are said by the drug czar's office to total 
  an estimated $35.6 billion for the year 2000 alone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">When you consider that 
  the drug czar's office has claimed that 77 percent of illegal drug users are 
  employed(6a), one has to wonder what is accomplished by the double cost to society 
  incurred by jailing them. Not only is it costing money to keep them warehoused, 
  but society is also losing the monies they otherwise would earn and contribute 
  to society. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The ONDCP estimated the 
  total using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Hourly Compensation Index. With some 
  648,544 prisoners incarcerated for &quot;drug-related&quot; crime, that works 
  out to $54,893 per person incarcerated. Of the total prisoner population thus 
  represented, 70.9 percent are serving sentences not for stealing money or hurting 
  people, but for violating drug laws. Assuming unemployment runs at 23% for marijuana 
  users per ONDCP claim, the 99,488 people in prison for marijuana charges are 
  thus &quot;costing&quot; society some $4.2 billion per year in lost wages and 
  other compensations.(6b) </font></p>

  Year </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">These marijuana defendants 
  come from somewhere. As noted above almost a quarter of a million arrests are 
  made each year for marijuana offenses with about nine out of ten of those for 
  possession alone. Police resources are not cheap, the average police officer 
  hourly pay nationally works out to about $23.(7a) And then of course equipment, 
  vehicles and other overhead drives these costs up further. Especially it seems 
  in drug arrests. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Pennsylvania State Police 
  calculated a &quot;total cost per incident&quot; rate of $468.09(7b) when responding 
  to calls in communities without their own police force. The predicted per incident 
  cost in the Flagler County Sheriffs Office in Florida for 2003 is $248.10.(7c) 
  San Diego estimates that for fiscal year 2003 the cost of investigating a narcotics 
  complaint at $1,741.(7d) Multnomah County in Oregon weighs in with an $1,850(7e) 
  drug arrest cost. Averaging the above four examples including lower cost, &quot;typical 
  incident&quot; costs, it seems reasonable conclude that an average marijuana 
  arrest conservatively costs $1076.79.(*) Total cost of marijuana arrests each

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial"><b>Conclusions</b></font><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">We bear some three quarters 
  of a million arrests for marijuana each year in the United States and about 
  135,000 persons are currently in prison after being convicted of either a state 
  felony or federal marijuana offense. This is a costly exercise at more than 
  $7 billion per year. At the time of this writing, US states are reporting a 
  combined $40 billion shortfall: &quot;Saying states face the most dire fiscal 
  situation since World War II, the National Governors Association(8a) and the 
  National Association of State Budget Officers released a report(8b) today that 
  concludes many states have exhausted budget cuts and drawing down rainy-day 
  funds and that the most difficult decisions still lay ahead.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">And in light of information 
  from the Rand Corporation a week later, which shows beyond reasonable doubt 
  that the already discredited &quot;gateway theory&quot; of marijuana use leading 
  to heroin or cocaine use is simply not likely. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Marijuana use among 
  adolescents does not appear to act as a &quot;gateway&quot; leading to the use 
  of harder drugs such as cocaine and heroin.(8c)&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">It's clear that at such 
  an enormous cost, there is some value to be gained by considering the wisdom 
  of jailing tens of thousands of Americans for no other reason than possession 
  of a plant that is currently considered politically incorrect. Just as this 
  report was going into public press another report has come out again decimating 
  the &quot;gateway theory.&quot; This one from Britain's Home Office said: &quot;The 
  analysis, based on recent survey data on nearly 4,000 children and young adults, 
  finds:No significant impact of soft drug use on the risk of later involvement 
  with crack and heroin. Very little impact of soft drug use on the risk of later 
  involvement in crime.(8d)&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Without the so-called 
  &quot;gateway theory&quot; the underpinnings of all these arrests become suspect. 
  It is time to revisit some basic assumptions about where resources are actually 
  being spent that could be better brought to bear on hard drug use, such as tobacco, 
  heroin and cocaine as well as alcohol. It's time to admit that current legal 
  distinctions between drugs in the US do not equal a given drugs pharmacology 
  or possible risk from harm. New strategies must be considered. New to us anyway. 
  Dutch &quot;coffee shops,&quot; quite successfully and happily, just passed 
  their thirtieth anniversary. The Ottawa Citizen in a story on December 19th, 
  reported &quot;Quebec court Judge Gilles Cadieux, who had postponed making a 
  decision on the case about 10 times, said the absence of a legal source of marijuana 
  takes away the right to life and liberty for those who need it.(8e)&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In this closely watched 
  medical marijuana case in Canada, &quot;Marc-Boris Saint-Maurice, director of 
  the Compassion Club, and Alexandre Neron, who worked at the club, were accused 
  of possession of marijuana and trafficking the drug.&quot; Saint-Maurice also 
  leader of the Marijuana Party in Canada promptly opened a Website offering medical 
  marijuana for sale, $30 for two grams and $120 for 10 grams of marijuana said 
  to be at least 8% THC, the most demonized active ingredient in marijuana. (Which 
  is also quite legal in the United States as Marinol.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">This kind of pressure 
  will surely be acutely felt in the US. Indeed the issue has been brought to 
  a boil in Santa Cruz, California where federal authorities reportedly handcuffed 
  a paraplegic to a bed in a medical marijuana case that sparked nationwide outrage. 
  From the WAMM Website: &quot;A hearing has been set for the Motion to Return 
  Property filed shortly after the DEA raid on Wo/Men&#146;s Alliance for Marijuana 
  (WAMM), a Santa Cruz based medical marijuana cooperative. The motion requests 
  the return of all personal property including 137 medical marijuana plants taken 
  in a DEA raid in early September from the 238 patient collective garden. The 
  raid touched off protests at federal buildings around the San Francisco Bay 
  area. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Attorney Ben Rice emphasized 
  this will be the first case heard after a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimous 
  decision earlier this week in the Conant v. Walters case in which Valerie Correl, 
  Director of WAMM, is a plaintiff. The decision emphasized the government cannot 
  revoke the licenses of California doctors who recommend medical marijuana to 
  their patients. It also states &quot;Medical marijuana, when grown locally for 
  personal consumption, does not have any direct or obvious effect on interstate 
  commerce.(8f)&quot;&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The huge human toll and 
  financial cost of marijuana prohibition in the United States needs to be weighed 
  against a legal and well regulated market. A good &quot;litmus test&quot; for 
  politicians considering drug policy should be to ask themselves two questions: 
  &quot;Can a twelve year old anywhere in the US belly up to the bar and be served 
  a shot of whiskey?&quot; And &quot;What policy best helps prevent minors from 
  access to alcohol: Prohibition or well crafted regulation?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">States are facing huge 
  budget deficits from the huge drain prison spending has become. As shown in 
  this BBSNews report, Punitive marijuana prohibition has resulted in hundreds 
  of thousands of arrests each year, half of all drug arrests. And states are 
  feeling the pressure of warehousing non-violent offendors serving mandatory 
  minimum sentences. What is especially troubling is the fact that arsonists and 
  other criminals that may really pose a threat to their communities are being 
  released as well as non-violent drug prisoners. The New York Times reported 
  on December 18th, 2002: &quot;Montana, Arkansas and Texas, along with Kentucky, 
  have discovered loopholes that allow them to release convicted felons early, 
  getting around the strict truth-in-sentencing laws and no parole policies passed 
  in the 1990's that were supposed to prevent such releases.(8g)&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">We should not need &quot;loopholes.&quot; 
  Regulating the trade in marijuana would pay for itself in savings to cash strapped 
  States budgets. And there would be tax revenue. Then the arsonists, robbers 
  and those that perpetrate domestic violence would not have to be released early 
  into society. </font></p>
