  Planned for June 6</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, Sans-serif" size="-1">The Marijuana Policy 
  Project (<a href="http://www.mpp.org" target="_blank">www.mpp.org</a>) and a 
  coalition of other marijuana and drug policy reform organizations are joining 
  forces to launch a national day of direct action against the DEA on June 6.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, Sans-serif" size="-1">At dozens of DEA 
  offices across the country, citizens will serve &quot;cease and desist&quot; 
  orders, demanding that the DEA end its war on medical marijuana. Other types 
  of dramatic, peaceful protests are also being planned. And some patients are 
  planning to engage in civil disobedience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, Sans-serif" size="-1">The effort, which 
  is being headed up by Americans for Safe Access (<a href="http://www.safeaccessnow.org" target="_blank">www.SafeAccessNow.org</a>), 
  is a direct response to the DEA's raids on medical marijuana clinics in California. 
  In October and again in February, the DEA raided medical marijuana providers 
  in West Hollywood, San Francisco, and a handful of other locations, seizing 
  patient records and forcing thousands of patients to turn to street sources 
  for their medicine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, Sans-serif" size="-1">If you would like 
  to help organize or participate in this protest at the DEA office nearest you, 
  contact Americans for Safe Access at <a href="mailto:info@safeaccessnow.org">info@SafeAccessNow.org</a>
