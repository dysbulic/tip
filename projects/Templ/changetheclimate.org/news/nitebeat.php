<p>On Monday, December 1st (tomorrow) at 7:00 PM, attorney Harvey Schwartz and 
  I will be featured guests on Nitebeat, the CN8 TV network. For those of you 
  who live in New England, the show will be aired live. Our segment will last 
  for 30 minutes. You can also <a href="http://ne.cn8.tv/shared/video/cn8NE-winmedia.asx">watch 
  the show live online at 7pm</a>.</p>
<p> Harvey and I were asked to be guests on the first segment of the innovative 
  news format show with Emmy Award winner, host Barry Nolan. Harvey Schwartz (Rodgers, 
  Powers &amp; Schwartz <a href="http://www.theemploymentlawyers.com/" target="_blank">www.theemploymentlawyers.com</a>) 
  is the ACLU-appointed attorney who has been leading this case since 2001.We 
  will be discussing our First Amendment case against the MBTA for refusing to 
  sell space to Change the Climate for our marijuana reform advertising. The MBTA 
  gladly accepts government ads on the subject. Our case has significant implications 
  for marijuana reform advertising and for all issue-oriented groups seeking to 
  use taxpayer-funded venues for protected free speech.</p>
<p>We expect the show to cover the details of the case, including an update on 
  our appeal that will soon be heard by the First District Federal Appeals Court 
  in Boston.</p>
<p>It should be a lively discussion. It is not clear whether the MBTA will have 
  a representative or if another anti-free speech representative will present 
  the government&#8217;s case. If there is an opportunity to participate, please 
  call or email during the show.</p>
<p>Please alert your friends and family so they can watch the show and participate. 
  Please email the producers at CN8 to let them know how important you feel it 
  is that they cover important topics like marijuana reform.</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest and support. </p>
