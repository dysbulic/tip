<p>A pro-pot group Friday rejected domestic violence advocates' demands to stop 
  the Monday debut of three Denver billboards showing a battered woman and urging 
  voters to reduce violence by passing a marijuana legalization measure.</p>
</font>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">The billboards show a downcast 
  woman with a black eye, her abuser lurking behind her, and the slogan: &quot;Reduce 
  family and community violence in Denver. Vote Yes on I-100.&quot; Nowhere is 
  there a mention that Initiative 100's passage would amend Denver law to make 
  it legal for adults to possess 1 ounce or less of marijuana.
