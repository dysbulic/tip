<P><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">If Rep. Ernest J. Istook Jr. (R-Okla.) 
  was incensed about poverty, injustice and other important issues facing this 
  country instead of grinding his teeth about an ad on Metro [&quot;Marijuana 
  Ad on Metro Infuriates Lawmaker,&quot; Metro, Dec. 3], the country and his constituents 
  would be better off. </font></P>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Further, his press secretary is 
  wrong about Metro promoting an &quot;illegal activity.&quot; The ad doesn't 
  say to grow, sell, buy or use marijuana -- activities that would be illegal.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">The ad asks people to lobby for 
  legalization and taxation of marijuana, both processes that continue to be legal 
  in the United States.</font>
