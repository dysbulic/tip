  of all, we believe that sex and marijuana use exist completely in the private 
  realm of consenting and responsible adults. We realize, unfortunately, that 
  many politicians see the bedroom and other private, individual activities as 
  important areas for government legislation. <b>We want to stress that sex and 
  marijuana are for adults - or at least for individuals who have achieved a level 
  of emotional &amp; psychological maturity that is reflected in a balanced, productive 
  life</b>. . .<a href="sex.php"><br>

  is common knowledge that U.S. taxpayers pay billions of dollars each year to 
  fund the failed War on Drugs. A simple analysis of the War on Drugs shows that 
  most of the costs borne by taxpayers are for marijuana prohibition. With over 
  700,000 annual arrests, thousands of prisoners and hundreds of millions of dollars 
  spent on anti-marijuana television ads, the War on Drugs is mostly a War on 
  Marijuana. . .<a href="taxes.php">read more &gt;</a> <br>

  <font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The true cost of marijuana 
  prohibition is difficult to obtain, and since the amount of money is staggering 
  by any measure the government is not interested in having this information widely 
  available. Change the Climate has used the cost of marijuana prohibition as 
  one of our main arguments for the need to change laws. Our advertising campaigns 
  in Washington DC and Nevada highlight the costs associated with the war on marijuana..
