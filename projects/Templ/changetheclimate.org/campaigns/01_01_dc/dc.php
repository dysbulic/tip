Back by popular demand, Change the Climate has launched a new ad campaign on 36 bus shelters around Washington DC.  Just in case you don't get to Washington by mid-May, here is what tens of thousands will see walking, standing and driving around our nation's capitol.  We'll show you what a real bus shelter looks like as soon as we can.
<p> Over 65% of Washington DC voters and millions of others around the country 
  have made their support for medical marijuana clear so we want to continue the 
  story by letting people know a few comparative facts. With your support, we 
  can tell the truth in many ways, in many cities. Visit <a href="http://www.changetheclimate.org/supportus/">www.changetheclimate.org/supportus/</a> 
  and sponsor an ad.<br>

    DC was one of 50 buses with a Change the Climate ad that ran as part of our 
    first campaign to "change the climate" around marijuana. Our 560 ads on buses 
    and in Metro stations generated over 4 million impressions during January 
    2001 -- inauguration month for George W. Bush.</font>
