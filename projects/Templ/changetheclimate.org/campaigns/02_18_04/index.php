  Change the Climate, along with the ACLU, Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) and 
  Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) filed an historic lawsuit against the Bush Administration 
  and the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority for violating our First Amendment 
  right to run marijuana law reform ads in public transit facilities.</font></P>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">As you may recall, our 
  <a href="../08_03_dc/index.php">&quot;Marijuana, Sex and Taxes&quot;</a> advertising 
  campaign on 600 buses, train platforms and bus shelters last fall in Washington 
  <a href="../../news/istook.php">outraged right-wing, anti-drug law reform lawmakers, 
  including Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK) who inserted censorship language 
  into the massive federal spending bill.</a> That bill was signed by President 
  Bush and became law on February 2. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial"> Change the Climate uses 
  provocative transit and billboard ads to stimulate public debate about our country&#8217;s 
  ineffective, dangerous and expensive marijuana laws. Conservative lawmakers 
  in Washington &#8211; like the leaders of Troy taking in the Trojan Horse filled 
  with Greek soldiers &#8211; took the bait and delivered us the opportunity to 
  educate citizens about our wasteful marijuana laws. Thank you Representative 
  Istook.</font></p>
