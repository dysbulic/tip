<p>This program is controlled completely by the mouse. Each action if done in a specific box will affect only that star, but if done in the space between boxes will affect them all.</p>
<p>
<code>Click</code> will toggle the running. If it is running it will stop and vice versa.</p>
<p>
<code>Alt-Click</code> will change the type of stroke used to draw the star and bounds.</p>
<p>
<code>Ctrl-Click</code> will change the number of lines in a star (sometime this is changed randomly to the same number it had before, but it dos change.)</p>
<p>
<code>Shift-Click</code> will change the angle that the star turns each time it changes. (Thus speeding or slowing its spin.)</p>

      <p>This is a demonstration of basic usage of the java2d affine transformations. I was having trouble using them in one of my programs and so I wrote this to understand them better. Though you can't see it this also demonstrates another convenience class I wrote which just displays components either as an applet or a program depending on how it is run. (If you were to look at the source the applet is called ComponentViewer and it takes an argument, component_1, with a value of ScaleTest. ScaleTest is a subclass of panel which is what you are actually seeing.)</p>
      <p>This program is perhaps one of the prettiest and it should work with nothing other than the java plug-in installed.</p>
