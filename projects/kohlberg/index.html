Subject: Re: book contents

Here's the info on the latest book that I am reading. Seems to be
interesting so far. I have said for a while that there are deep
philosophical ramifications for Kohlberg to claim a moral standard
that transcends culture-specificity. His first essay (which is the
only one not written specifically for this book) recognizes that and
talks about it. It is really neat to hear him discuss the different
philosophical stances in terms of his model.
