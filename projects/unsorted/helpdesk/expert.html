This is going to be the spot where I keep track of the progress that I am making in my summertime quest to become a helpdesk expert. There are three tiers of helpdeskerness and I am currently on the second. Nobody in the past 3 or four years has made it past here so I reckoned I'd give it a shot.
<br><br>
The major parts of what I am doing at this point is:
<ul>
  <li>Helping with classes (.75 x 3)</li>
  <li>Writing a thesis template for word (2)</li>
  <li>Writing a couple of programs to set up timeclocking on working helpdeskers (2)</li>
</ul>
All told I need 6 points and this will give me 2.25 + 2 + 2 = 6.25 so if I get this stuff done this summer I ought to get a raise and a new title. What would especially float my boat would be if I would get a $.10 raise for being around as long as I have since the 7-8:00 hour that I work in the fall pays $5.75 and if I got the $.10 plus $.25 for advancing I'd make $5.75 the whole time. As it is I don't think that it would hardly even be worth it to fill out another time sheet for $2.00 a month.
<br><br>
I just have really fond dreams of making 20 x $5.75 x 4 = $460.00 a month, well if things go like Srini had mentioned and I get to keep some java work for 10 x $6.50 x 4 = $260.00 on top of that for a net total of 460 + 260 = $720.00 I might actually get to the point where I could get a couple of things like some ram and a zip drive which would be cool as all get out.
<br><br>
Getting there however will take a bit of work. The timeclocking program ought not to be that hard since it is just going to be ANSI C which I am pretty good in as it is. The thesis template is going to be in Word's macro language which I do not know at all well and am going to have to learn. I think it is what I am going to tackle first. A similar product has already been developed by the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a>.
