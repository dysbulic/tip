    <h1><a href="http://www.tntech.edu">Tennessee Tech</a> Helpdesk Utilities</h1>
    <p>Long long ago ('96 - '02) I was a student at good ol' TTU. ("<em>There are lots of people that take seven years to get their degree; they're called 'doctors.'</em>") During my extended tenure I rewrote the utilities used by the helpdesk workers to report their status. These are just here for me to reminisce over from time to time and maybe reference if, <em>God forbid</em>, I need to write some C.</p>
    <h2>Checkin</h2>
    <p>At :15 past and :15 before we had to run a little program called "<a href="checkin.c">checkin</a>" to say that we were alive and that there were no problems in the lab.</p>
    <h2>Roomcount</h2>
    <p>At :30 past we ran another program called "<a href="roomcount.c">roomcount</a>" with a report of how many people were in the lab.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The more entertaining program than either of these was the little <acronym title="Digital Command Language">DCL</acronym> script which created a batch job and ran both of these programs automatically with random values so I didn't have to be bothered with them. &#x263A;</p>
