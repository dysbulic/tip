  <body>
    <p>I entertain myself by playing on the computer. Unfortunately my
    pets soon bore me and this is where they end up. There's some
    interesting things here as well as lots of stuff that's not yet
    finished. Every so often one will try to crawl from its dusty
    virtual crypt, but after I've toyed with it for a bit. (And as
    often as not broken it.) Back into the ground it goes.</p>

    <p>There is something to be said for wandering about here, but if
    you would like a more organized list of the ones that got at least
    mostly finished, see <a
    href="http://www.himinbi.org">www.himinbi.org</a>.</p>
