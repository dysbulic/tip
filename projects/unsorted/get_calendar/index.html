    <h1>Calendar Mailer</h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.page-a-day.com">Page-a-day Calendars</a>
    has a very nice online portal to access their daily calendars. The
    one thing that I wanted though was to bypass the starting up a
    browser and logging in, so I wrote a couple little programs to get
    the calendars and mail them to me daily.</p>
    <p>There are two shell scripts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="get_calendar.sh">get_calendar.sh</a>: to retrieve
      the calendar pages</li>
      <li><a href="mail_calendar.sh">mail_calendar.sh</a>: to package
      them up in a mail message and send them on their way</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are run from a crontab entry like:</p>
    <pre>
 0  8 * * * ~/get_calendar/mail_calendar.sh -e will@himinbi.org -p pass -f -c ZENN -n "Zen" will@himinbi.org
 0  8 * * * ~/get_calendar/mail_calendar.sh -e will@himinbi.org -p pass -f -c DARW -n "Darwin Award" will@himinbi.org
 0  8 * * * ~/get_calendar/mail_calendar.sh -e will@himinbi.org -p pass -f -c MENS -n "Mensa Question" will@himinbi.org
30 17 * * * ~/get_calendar/mail_calendar.sh -e will@himinbi.org -p pass -f -b -c MENS -n "Mensa Answer" will@himinbi.org
    </pre>
    <p>One thing that you might notice is that the Mensa calendar is
    checked twice a day. This front page (with the question) comes in
    at 8am and then both the front and back (with the answer) comes in
    at 5:30pm.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The programs are not terribly complex, but at the same time
    non-trivial.</p>
    <p>The retrieval program has to access multiple pages and store
    session keys in order to access the site. This 50 lines of shell
    script in a replacement for 200 lines of <a
    href="GetCalendar.java">java</a> thanks to <a
    href="http://curl.haxx.se">curl</a>.</p>
    <p>The mailing program supports the fact that some calendar pages
    have embedded images and cross multiple pages. It uses the
    multipart/related and multipart/mixed sections respectively. It is
    also sensitive to users with text email readers with
    multipart/alternative sections. All this was fairly easy thanks to
    the <a href="http://www.mhost.com/nmh/">nmh mail suite</a>.</p>
