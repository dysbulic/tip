<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was the year when they finally immanentized the Eschaton. On April 1, the
world's great powers came closer to nuclear war than ever before, all because of
an obscure island named Fernando Poo. By the time international affairs returned
to their normal cold-war level, some wits were calling it the most tasteless
April Fool's joke in history. I happen to know all the details about what
happened, but I have no idea how to recount them in a manner that will make
sense to most readers. For instance, I am not even sure who' I am, and my
embarrassment on that matter makes me wonder if you will believe anything I
reveal. Worse yet, I am at the moment very conscious of a squirrel-in Central
Park, just off Sixty-eighth Street, in New York City-that is leaping from one
tree to another, and I think that happens on the night of April 23 (or is it the
morning of April 24?), but fitting the squirrel together with Fernando Poo is,
for the present, beyond my powers. I beg your tolerance. There is nothing I can
do to make things any easier for any of us, and you will have to accept being
addressed by a disembodied voice just as I accept the compulsion to speak out
even though I am painfully aware that I am talking to an invisible, perhaps
nonexistent, audience. Wise men have regarded the earth as a tragedy, a farce,
even an illusionist's trick; but all, if they are truly wise and not merely
intellectual rapists, recognize that it is certainly some kind of stage in which
we all play roles, most of us being very poorly coached and totally unrehearsed
before the curtain rises. Is it too much if I ask, tentatively, that we agree to
look upon it as a circus, a touring carnival wandering about the sun for a
record season of four billion years and producing new monsters and miracles,
hoaxes and bloody mishaps, wonders and blunders, but never quite entertaining
the customers well enough to prevent them from leaving, one by one, and
returning to their homes for a long and bored winter's sleep under the dust?
Then, say, for a while at least, that I have found an identity as ringmaster;
but that crown sits uneasily on my head (if I have a head) and I must warn you
that the troupe is small for a universe this size and many of us have to double
or triple our stints, so you can expect me back in many other guises. Indeed do
many things come to pass.</p>
<p>For instance, right now, I am not at all whimsical or humorous. I am angry. I
am in Nairobi, Kenya, and my name is, if you will pardon me, Nkrumah Fubar. My
skin is black (does that disturb you? it doesn't me), and I am, like most of
you, midway between tribalism and technology; to be more blunt, as a Kikuyu
shaman moderately adjusted to city life, I still believe in witchcraft-I
haven't, yet, the folly to deny the evidence of my own senses. It is April 3 and
Fernando Poo has ruined my sleep for several nights running, so I hope you will
forgive me when I admit that my business at the moment is far from edifying and
is nothing less than constructing dolls of the rulers of America, Russia, and
China. You guessed it: I am going to stick pins in their heads every day for a
month; if they won't let me sleep, I won't let them sleep. That is Justice, in a
sense.</p>
<p>In fact, the President of the United States had several severe migraines
during the following weeks; but the atheistic rulers of Moscow and Peking were
less susceptible to magic. They never reported a twinge. But, wait, here is
another performer in our circus, and one of the most intelligent and decent in
the lot-his name is unpronounceable, but you can call him Howard and he happens
to have been born a dolphin. He's swimming through the ruins of Atlantis and
it's April 10 already-time is moving; I'm not sure what Howard sees but it
bothers him, and he decides to tell Hagbard Celine all about it. Not that I
know, at this point, who Hagbard Celine is. Never mind; watch the waves roll and
be glad there isn't much pollution out here yet. Look at the way the golden sun
lights each wave with a glint that, curiously, sparkles into a silver sheen; and
watch, watch the waves as they roll, so that it is easy to cross five hours of
time in one second and find ourselves amid trees and earth, with even a few
falling leaves for a touch of poetry before the horror. Where are we? Five hours
away, I told you-five hours due west, to be precise, so at the same instant that
Howard turns a somersault in Atlantis, Sasparilla Godzilla, a tourist from
Simcoe, Ontario (she had the misfortune to be born a human being) turns a neat
nosedive right here and lands unconscious on the ground. This is the outdoor
extension of the Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, Mexico, D.F., and
the other tourists are rather upset about the poor lady's collapse. She later
said it was the heat. Much less sophisticated in important matters than Nkrumah
Fubar, she didn't care to tell anybody, or even to remind herself, what had
really knocked her over. Back in Simcoe, the folks always said Harry Godzilla
got a sensible woman when he married Sasparilla, and it is sensible in Canada
(or the United States) to hide certain truths. No, at this point I had better
not call them truths. Let it stand that she either saw, or imagined she saw, a
certain sinister kind of tight grin, or grimace, cross the face of the gigantic
statue of Tlaloc, the rain god. Nobody from Simcoe had ever seen anything like
that before; indeed do many things come to pass.</p>
<p>And, if you think the poor lady was an unusual case, you should examine the
records of psychiatrists, both institutional and private, for the rest of the
month. Reports of unusual anxieties and religious manias among schizophrenics in
mental hospitals skyrocketed; and ordinary men and women walked in off the
street to complain about eyes watching them, hooded beings passing through
locked rooms, crowned figures giving unintelligible commands, voices that
claimed to be God or the Devil, a real witch's brew for sure. But the sane
verdict was to attribute all this to the aftermath of the Fernando Poo tragedy.</p>
<p>The phone rang at 2:30 A.M. the morning of April 24. Numbly, dumbly, mopingly,
gropingly, out of the dark, I find and identify a body, a self, a task.
&quot;Goodman,&quot; I say into the receiver, propped up on one arm, still
coming a long way back.</p>
<p>&quot;Bombing and homicide,&quot; he electrically eunuchoid voice in the
transmitter tells me. I sleep naked (sorry about that), and I'm putting on my
drawers and trousers as I copy the address. East Sixty-eighth Street, near the
Council on Foreign Relations. &quot;Moving,&quot; I say, hanging up.</p>
<p>&quot;What? Is?&quot; Rebecca mumbles from the bed. She's naked, too, and
that recalls very pleasant memories of a few hours earlier. I suppose some of
you will be shocked when I tell you I'm past sixty and she's only twenty-five.
It doesn't make it any better that we're married, I know.</p>
<p>This isn't a bad body, for its age, and seeing Rebecca, most of the sheets
thrown aside, reminds me just how good it is. In fact, at this point I don't
even remember having been the ringmaster, or what echo I retain is confused with
sleep and dream. I kiss her neck, unself-con-sciously, for she is my wife and I
am her husband, and even if I am an inspector on the Homicide Squad-Homicide
North, to be exact-any notions about being a stranger in this body have vanished
with my dreams into air. Into thin air.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Rebecca repeats, still more asleep than awake.</p>
<p>&quot;Damned fool radicals again,&quot; I say, pulling on my shirt, knowing
any answer is as good as another in her half-conscious state.</p>
<p>&quot;Um,&quot; she says, satisfied, and turns over into deep sleep again.</p>
<p>I washed my face somewhat, tired old man watching me from the mirror, and ran
a brush through my hair. Just time enough to think that retirement was only a
few years away and to remember a certain hypodermic needle and a day in the
Catskills with my first wife, Sandra, back when they at least had clean air up
there . . . socks, shoes, tie, fedora . . . and you never stop mourning, as much
as I loved Rebecca I never stopped mourning Sandra. Bombing <i>and </i>homicide.
What a <i>meshuganah </i>world. Do you remember when you could at least drive in
New York at three in the morning without traffic jams? Those days were gone; the
trucks that were banned in the daytime were all making their deliveries now.
Everybody was supposed to pretend the pollution went away before dawn. Papa used
to say, &quot;Saul, Saul, they did it to the Indians and now they're doing it to
themselves. <i>Goyische narrs.&quot; </i>He left Russia to escape the pogrom of
1905, but I guess he saw a lot before he got out. He seemed like a cynical old
man to me then, and I seem like a cynical old man to others now. Is there any
pattern or sense in any of it?</p>
<p>The scene of the blast was one of those old office buildings with
Gothic-and-gingerbread styling all over the lobby floor. In the dim light of the
hour, it reminded me of the shadowy atmosphere of Charlie Chan in the Wax
Museum. And a smell hit my nostrils as soon as I walked in.</p>
<p>A patrolman lounging inside the door snapped to attention when he recognized
me. &quot;Took out the seventeenth floor and part of the eighteenth,&quot; he
said. &quot;Also a pet shop here on the ground level. Some freak of dynamics.
Nothing else is damaged down here, but every fish tank went. That's the
smell.&quot;</p>
<p>Barney Muldoon, an old friend with the look and mannerisms of a Hollywood
cop, appeared out of the shadows. A tough man, and nowhere as dumb as he liked
to pretend, which was why he was head of the Bomb Squad.</p>
<p>&quot;Your baby, Barney?&quot; I asked casually.</p>
<p>&quot;Looks that way. Nobody killed. The call went out to you because a
clothier's dummy was burned on the eighteenth floor and the first car here
thought it was a human body.&quot;</p>
<p><i>(Wait: George Dorn is screaming.</i>...)</p>
<p>Saul's face showed no reaction to the answer-but poker players at the
Fraternal Order of Police had long ago given up trying to read that inscrutible
Talmudic countenance. As Barney Muldoon, I knew how I would feel if I had the
chance to drop this case on another department and hurry home to a beautiful
bride like Rebecca Goodman. I smiled down at Saul-his height would keep him from
appointment to the Force now, but the rules were different when he was young-and
I added quietly, &quot;There might be something in it for you, though.&quot;</p>
<p>The fedora ducked as Saul took out his pipe and started to fill it. All he
said was, &quot;Oh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right now,&quot; I went on, &quot;we're just notifying Missing Persons,
but if what I'm afraid of is right, it'll end up on your desk after all.&quot;</p>
<p>He struck a match and started puffing. &quot;Somebody missing at this hour .
. . might be found among the living ... in the morning,&quot; he said between
drags. The match went out, and shadows moved where nobody stirred.</p>
<p>&quot;And he might not, in this case,&quot; Muldoon said. &quot;He's been
gone three days now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An Irishman your size can't be any more subtle than an elephant,&quot;
Saul said wearily. &quot;Stop tantalizing me. What have you got?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The office that was hit,&quot; Muldoon explained, obviously happy to
share the misery, &quot;was a magazine called <i>Confrontation. </i>It's kind of
left-of-center, so this was probably a right-wing job and not a left-wing one.
But the interesting thing is that we couldn't reach the editor, Joseph Malik, at
his home, and when we called one of the associate editors, what do you think he
told us? Malik disappeared three days ago. His landlord confirms it. He's been
trying to get hold of Malik himself because there's a no-pets rule there and the
other tenants are complaining about his dogs. So, if a man drops out of sight
and then his office gets bombed, I kind of think the matter might come to the
attention of the Homicide Department eventually, don't you?&quot;</p>
<p>Saul grunted. &quot;Might and might not,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm going home.
I’ll check with Missing Persons in the morning, to see what they've got.&quot;</p>
<p>The patrolman spoke up. &quot;You know what bothers me most about this? The
Egyptian mouth-breeders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The what?&quot; Saul asked.</p>
<p>&quot;That pet shop,&quot; the patrolman explained, pointing to the other end
of the lobby. &quot;I looked over the damage, and they had one of the best
collections of rare tropical fish in New York City. Even Egyptian
mouth-breeders.&quot; He noticed the expressions on the faces of the two
detectives and added lamely, &quot;If you don't collect fish, you wouldn't
understand. But, believe me, an Egyptian mouth-breeder is pretty hard to get
these days, and they're all dead in there.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Mouth-breeder?&quot; </i>Muldoon asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you see they keep their young in their mouths for a couple days
after birth and they never, never swallow them. That's one of the great things
about collecting fish: you get to appreciate the wonders of nature.&quot;</p>
<p>Muldoon and Saul looked at each other. &quot;It's inspiring,&quot; Muldoon
said finally, &quot;to have so many college graduates on the Force these
days.&quot;</p>
<p>The elevator door opened, and Dan Pricefixer, a redheaded young detective on
Muldoon's staff, emerged, carrying a metal box.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is important, Barney,&quot; he began immediately, with
just a nod to Saul. &quot;Damned important. I found it in the rubble, and it had
been blown partly open, so I looked inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And?&quot; Muldoon prompted.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the freakiest bunch of interoffice memos I ever set eyes on. Weird
as tits on a bishop.&quot;</p>
<p>This is going to be a long night, Saul thought suddenly, with a sinking
feeling. A long night, and a heavy case.</p>
<p>&quot;Want to peek?&quot; Muldoon asked him maliciously.</p>
<p>&quot;You better find a place to sit down,&quot; Pricefixer volunteered.
&quot;It'll take you awhile to go through them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's use the cafeteria,&quot; Saul suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;You just have no idea,&quot; the patrolman repeated. &quot;The value of
an Egyptian mouth-breeder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's rough for all nationalities, man or fish,&quot; Muldoon said in
one of his rare attempts to emulate Saul's mode of speech. He and Saul turned to
the cafeteria, leaving the patrolman looking vaguely distressed.</p>
<p>His name is James Patrick Hennessy and he's been on the Force three years. He
doesn't come back into this story at all. He had a five-year-old retarded son
whom he loved helplessly; you see a thousand faces like his on the street every
day and never guess how well they are carrying their tragedies . . . and George
Dorn, who once wanted to shoot him, is still screaming. . . . But Barney and
Saul are in the cafeteria. Look around. The transition from the Gothic lobby to
this room of laminated functional and glittering plastic colors is, one might
say, trippy. Never mind the smell; we're closer to the pet shop here.</p>
<p>Saul removed his hat and ran a hand through his gray hair pensively, as
Muldoon read the first two memos in one quick scan. When they were passed over,
he put on</p>
<p>his glasses and read more slowly, in his own methodical and thoughtful way.
Hold onto your hats. This is what they said:</p>
<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #1</p>
<p>7/23</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p>The first reference I've found is in <i>Violence </i>by Jacques Ellul (Seabury
Press, New York, 1969). He says (pages 18-19) that the Illuminated Ones were
founded by Joachim of Floris in the llth century and originally taught a
primitive Christian doctrine of poverty and equality, but later under the
leadership of Fra Dolcino in the 15th century they became violent, plundered the
rich and announced the imminent reign of the Spirit. &quot;In 1507,&quot; he
concludes, &quot;they were vanquished by the 'forces of order'-that is, an army
commanded by the Bishop of Vercueil.&quot; He makes no mention of any Illuminati
movement in earlier centuries or in more recent times. I'll have more later
today.</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>P.S. I found a little more about Joachim of Floris in the back files of the <i>National
Review, </i>William Buckley and his cronies think Joachim is responsible for
modern liberalism, socialism and communism; they've condemned him in fine
theological language. He committed the heresy, they say, of &quot;immanentizing
the Christian Eschaton.&quot; Do you want me to look that up in a technical
treatise on Thomism? I think it means bringing the end of the world closer, sort
of.</p>
<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO <i>#2</i></p>
<p>7/23</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p>My second source was more helpful: Akron Daraul, <i>A History of Secret
Societies </i>(Citadel Press, New York, 1961).</p>
<p>Daraul traces the Illuminati back to the 11th century also, but not to
Joachim of Floris. He sees the origin in the Ishmaelian sect of Islam, also
known as the Order of Assassins. They were vanquished in the 13th century, but
later made a comeback with a new, less-violent philosophy</p>
<p>and eventually became the Ishmaelian sect of today, led by the Aga Khan.
However, in the 16th century, in Afghanistan, the Illuminated Ones (Roshinaya)
picked up the original tactics of the Order of Assassins. They were wiped out by
an alliance of the Moguls and Persians (pages 220-223). But, &quot;The beginning
of the seventeenth century saw the foundation of the Illuminated Ones of
Spain-the Allumbrados, condemned by an edict of the Grand Inquisition in 1623.
In 1654, the 'illuminated' Guerinets came into public notice in France.&quot;
And, finally-the part you're most interested in- the Bavarian II-luminati was
founded on May Day, 1776, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, by Adam Weishaupt, a former
Jesuit. &quot;Documents still extant show several points of resemblance between
the German and Central Asian I'himi-nists: points that are hard to account for
on grounds of pure coincidence&quot; (page 255). Weishaupt's Illuminati were
suppressed by the Bavarian government in 1785; Daraul also mentions the
Illuminati of Paris in the 1880s, but suggests it was simply a passing fad. He
does not accept the notion that the Illuminati still exist today.</p>
<p>This is beginning to look big. Why are we keeping the details from George?</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>Saul and Muldoon exchanged glances. &quot;Let's see the next one,&quot; Saul
said. He and Muldoon read together:</p>
<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #3</p>
<p>7/24</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p><i>The Encyclopedia Britannica </i>has little to say on the subject (1966
edition, Volume 11, &quot;Halicar to Impala,&quot; page 1094):</p>
<p><i>Illuminati, </i>a short-lived movement of republican free thought founded
on May Day 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, professor of canon law at Ingolstadt and a
former Jesuit. . . . From 1778 onward they began to make contact with various
Masonic lodges where, under the impulse of A. Knigge (q.v.) one of their chief
converts, they often managed to gain a commanding position. . . .</p>
<p>The scheme itself had its attractions for literary men like Goethe and
Herder, and even for the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar....</p>
<p>The movement suffered from internal dissention and was ultimately banned by
an edict of the Bavarian government in 1785.</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>Saul paused. &quot;I'll make you a bet, Barney,&quot; he said quietly.
&quot;The Joseph Malik who vanished is the J.M. these memos were written
for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Muldoon replied scornfully. &quot;These Illuminati
characters are still around, and they got him. Honest to God, Saul,&quot; he
added, &quot;I appreciate the way your mind usually pole-vaults ahead of the
facts. But you can ride a hunch just so far when you're starting from
nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're not starting from nothing,&quot; Saul said softly. &quot;Here's
what we've got to start with. One&quot;-he-held up a finger-&quot;a building is
bombed. Two&quot;-another finger- &quot;an important executive disappeared three
days before the bombing. Already, there's an inference, or two inferences:
something got him, or else he knew something was coming for him and he ducked
out. Now, look at the memos. Point three&quot;-he held up another finger-&quot;a
standard reference work, the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica, </i>seems to be wrong
about when the Illuminati came into existence. They say eighteenth-century
Germany, but the other memos trace it back to-let's see-Spain in the seventeenth
century, France in the seventeenth century, then in the eleventh century back to
Italy and halfway across the world to Afghanistan. So we've got a second
inference: if the Britannica is wrong about when the thing started, they may be
wrong about when it ended. Now, put these three points and two inferences
together-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the Illuminati got the editor and blew up his office. Nutz. I still
say you're going too fast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I'm not going fast enough,&quot; Saul said. &quot;An organization
that has existed for a couple of centuries <i>minimum </i>and kept its secrets
pretty well hidden most of that time might be pretty strong by now.&quot; He
trailed off into silence, and closed his eyes to concentrate. After a moment, he
looked at the younger man with a searching glance.</p>
<p>Muldoon had been thinking too. &quot;I've seen men land on the moon,&quot; he
said. &quot;I've seen students break into administration offices and shit in the
dean's waste basket. I've even seen nuns in mini-skirts. But this international
conspiracy existing in secret for eight hundred years, it's like opening a door
in your own house and finding James Bond and the President of the United States
personally shooting it out with Fu Manchu and the five original Marx
Brothers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're trying to convince yourself, not me. Barney, it sticks out so
far that you could break it into three pieces and each one would be long enough
to goose somebody up in the Bronx. There <i>is </i>a secret society that keeps
screwing up international politics. Every intelligent person has suspected that
at one time or another. Nobody wants war any more, but wars keep happening-why?
Face it, Barney-this is the heavy case we've always had nightmares about. It's
cast iron. If it were a corpse, all six pallbearers would get double hernias at
the funeral. Well?&quot; Saul prompted.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we're either going to have to do something or get off the pot, as
my sainted mother used to say.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the year when they finally immanentized the Eschaton. On April 1 the
world's great powers came closer to nuclear war than ever before, all because of
an obscure island named Fernando Poo. But, while all other eyes turned to the UN
building in apprehension and desperate hope, there lived in Las Vegas a unique
person known as Carmel. His house was on Date Street and had a magnificent view
of the desert, which he appreciated. He liked to spend long hours looking at the
wild cactus wasteland although he did not know why. If you told him that he was
symbolically turning his back upon mankind, he would not have understood you,
nor would he have been insulted; the remark would be merely irrelevant to him.
If you added that he himself was a desert creature, like the gila monster and
the rattlesnake, he would have grown bored and classified you as a fool. To
Carmel, most of the world were fools who asked meaningless questions and worried
about pointless issues; only a few, like himself, had discovered what was really
important-money- and pursued it without distractions, scruples, or
irrelevancies. His favorite moments were those, like this night of April 1, when
he sat and tallied his take for the month and looked out his picture window
occasionally at the flat sandy landscape, dimly lit by the lights of the city
behind him. In this physical and emotional desert he experienced happiness, or
something as close to happiness as he could ever find. His girls had earned
$46,000 during March, of which he took $23,000; after paying 10 percent to the
Brotherhood for permission to operate without molestation by Banana-Nose
Maldonado's soldiers, this left a tidy profit of $20,700, all of it tax free.
Little Carmel, who stood five feet two and had the face of a mournful weasel,
beamed as he completed his calculations; his emotion was as inexpressible, in
normal terms, as that of a necrophile who had just broken into the town morgue.
He had tried every possible sexual combination with his girls; none gave him the
<i>frisson </i>of looking at a figure like that at the end of a month.</p>
<p>He did not know that he would have another $5 million, and incidentally
become the most important human being on earth, before May 1. If you tried to
explain it to him, he would have brushed everything else aside and asked merely,
&quot;The five million-how many throats do I hafta cut to <i>get my hands in
it?&quot;</i></p>
<p>But wait: Get out the Atlas and look up Africa. Run your eyes down the map of
the western coast of that continent until you come to Equatorial Guinea. Stop at
the bend where part of the Atlantic Ocean curves inward and becomes the Bight of
Biafra. You will note a chain of small islands; you will further observe that
one of these is Fernando Poo. There, in the capital city of Santa Isobel, during
the early 1970s, Captain Ernesto Tequilla y Mota carefully read and reread
Edward Luttwak's <i>Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook, </i>and placidly went
about following Luttwak's formula for a perfect coup d'etat in Santa Isobel. He
set up a timetable, made his first converts among other officers, formed a
clique, and began the slow process of arranging things so that officers likely
to be loyal to Equatorial Guinea would be on assignment at least forty-eight
hours away from the capital city when the coup occurred. He drafted the first
proclamation to be issued by his new government; it took the best slogans of the
most powerful left-wing and right-wing groups on the island and embedded them
firmly in a tapiocalike context of bland liberal-conservatism. It fit Luttwak's
prescription excellently, giving everybody on the island some small hope that
his own interests and beliefs would be advanced by the new regime. And, after
three years of planning, he struck: the key officials of the old regime were
quickly, bloodlessly, placed under house arrest; troops under the command of
officers in the cabal occupied the power stations and newspaper offices; the
inoffensively fascist-conservative-liberal-communist proclamation of the new
People's Republic of Fernando Poo went forth to the world over the radio station
in Santa Isobel. Ernesto Tequilla y Mota had achieved his ambition-promotion
from captain to generalissimo in one step. Now, at last, he began wondering
about how one went about governing a country. He would probably have to read a
new book, and he hoped there was one as good as Luttwak's treatise on seizing a
country. That was on March 14.</p>
<p>On March 15, the very name of Fernando Poo was unknown to every member of the
House of Representatives, every senator, every officer of the Cabinet, and all
but one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In fact, the President's first reaction,
when the CIA report landed on his desk that afternoon, was to ask his secretary,
&quot;Where the hell is Fernando Poo?&quot;</p>
<p>Saul took off his glasses and polished them with a handkerchief, conscious of
his age and suddenly more tired than ever. &quot;I outrank you, Barney,&quot; he
began.</p>
<p>Muldoon grinned. &quot;I know what's coming.&quot;</p>
<p>Methodically, Saul went on, &quot;Who, on your staff, do you think is a
double agent for the CIA?</p>
<p>&quot;Robinson I'm sure of, and Lehrman I suspect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Both of them go. We take no chances.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll have them transferred to the Vice Squad in the morning. How about
your own staff?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Three of them, I think, and they go, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vice Squad'll love the increase in manpower.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul relit his pipe. &quot;One more thing. We might be hearing from the
FBI.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We might indeed.&quot;</p>
<p>'They get nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're really taking me way out on this one, Saul.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes you have to follow your hunches. This is going to be a heavy
case, agreed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A heavy case,&quot; Muldoon nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Then we do it my way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's look at the fourth memo,&quot; Muldoon said tonelessly. They
read:</p>
<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT:<b> </b>MEMO <i>#4</i></p>
<p>7/24</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p>Here's a letter that appeared in <i>Playboy </i>a few years ago ('The Playboy
Advisor,&quot; <i>Playboy, </i>April, 1969, pages 62-64):</p>
<p>I recently heard an old man of right-wing views-a friend of my
grandparents-assert that the current wave of assassinations in America is the
work of a secret society called the Illuminati. He said that the Illuminati have
existed throughout history, own the international banking cartels, have all been
32nd-degree Masons and were known to lan Fleming, who portrayed them as <i>Spectre
</i>in his James Bond books-for which the Illuminati did away with Mr. Fleming.
At first all this seemed like a paranoid delusion to me. Then I read in <i>The
New Yorker </i>that Allan Chapman, one of Jim Garrison's investigators in the
New Orleans probe of the John Kennedy assassination, believes that the
Illuminati really exist....</p>
<p><i>Playboy, </i>of course, puts down the whole idea as ridiculous and gives
the standard <i>Encyclopedia Britannica </i>story that the Illuminati went out
of business in 1785.</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>Pricefixer stuck his head in the cafeteria door. &quot;Minute?&quot; he
asked.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; Muldoon replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter Jackson is out here. He's the associate editor I spoke to on the
phone. He just told me something about his last meeting with Joseph Malik, the
editor, before Malik disappeared.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bring him in,&quot; Muldoon said.</p>
<p>Peter Jackson was a black man-truly black, not brown or tan. He was wearing a
vest in spite of the spring weather. He was also very obviously wary of
policemen. Saul noted this at once, and began thinking about how to overcome
it-and at the same time he observed an increased blandness in Muldoon's
features, indicating that he, too, had noted it and was prepared to take
umbrage.</p>
<p>&quot;Have a seat,&quot; Saul said cordially, &quot;and tell us what you just
told the other officer.&quot; With the nervous ones it</p>
<p>was sound policy to drop the policeman role at first, and try to sound like
somebody else-somebody who, quite naturally, asks a lot of questions. Saul began
slipping into the personality of his own family physician, which he usually used
at such times. He made himself <i>feel </i>a stethoscope hanging about his neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Jackson began in a Harvard accent, &quot;this is probably
not important. It may be just a coincidence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most of what we hear is just unimportant coincidence,&quot; Saul said
gently. &quot;But it's our job to listen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody but the lunatic fringe has given up on this by now,&quot;
Jackson said. &quot;It really surprised me when Joe told me what he was getting
the magazine into.&quot; He paused and studied the two impassive faces of the
detectives; finding little there, he went on reluctantly. &quot;It was last
Friday. Joe told me he had a lead that interested him, and he was putting a
staff writer on it. He wanted to reopen the investigation of the assassinations
of Martin Luther King and the Kennedy brothers.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul carefully didn't look at Muldoon, and just as carefully moved his hat to
cover the memos on the table. &quot;Excuse me a moment,&quot; he said politely
and left the cafeteria.</p>
<p>He found a phone booth in the lobby and dialed his home. Rebecca answered
after the third ring; she obviously had not gotten back to sleep after he left.
&quot;Saul?&quot; she asked, guessing who would be calling at this hour.
&quot;It's going to be a long night,&quot; Saul said. &quot;Oh, hell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know, baby. But this case is a son-of-a-bitch!&quot; Rebecca sighed.
&quot;I'm glad we had a little ball earlier this evening. Otherwise, I'd be
furious.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul thought, suddenly, of how this conversation would sound to an outsider.
A sixty-year-old man and a twenty-five-year-old wife. And if they knew she was a
whore and a heroin addict when I first met her . ..</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know what I'm going to do?&quot; Rebecca lowered her voice.
&quot;I'm going to take off my nightgown, and throw the covers to the foot of
the bed, and lie here naked, thinking about you and waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul grinned. &quot;A man my age shouldn't be able to respond to that, after
doing what I did earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you did respond, didn't you?&quot; Her voice was confident and
sensual.</p>
<p>&quot;I sure did. I won't be able to leave the phone booth for a couple of
minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>She chuckled softly and said, &quot;I'll be waiting. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you,&quot; he said, surprised (as always) at the simple truth of
it in a man his age. I won't be able to leave the phone booth at all if this
keeps up, he thought. &quot;Listen,&quot; he added hurriedly, &quot;let's change
the subject before I start resorting to the vices of a high school boy. What do
you know about the Illuminati?&quot; Rebecca had been an anthropology major,
with a minor in psychology, before the drug scene had captured her and she fell
into the abyss from which he had rescued her; her erudition often astonished
him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a hoax,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;A what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A hoax. A bunch of students at Berkeley started it back around
sixty-six or sixty-seven.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, that's not what I'm asking. The original Illuminati in Italy and
Spain and Germany in the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries? You know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that's the basis of the hoax. Some right-wing historians think the
Illuminati still exist, you see, so these students opened an Illuminati chapter
on the campus at Berkeley and started sending out press releases on all sorts of
weird subjects, so people who want to believe in conspiracies would have some
evidence to point to. That's all there is to it. Sophomore humor.&quot;</p>
<p>I hope so, Saul thought. &quot;How about the Ishmaelian sect of Islam?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It has twenty-three divisions, but the Aga Khan is the leader of all of
them. It was founded around-oh-1090 A.D., I think, and was originally
persecuted, but now it's part of the orthodox Moslem religion. It has some
pretty weird doctrines. The founder, Hassan i Sabbah, taught that nothing is
true and everything is permissible. He lived up to that idea-the word 'assassin'
is a corruption of his name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anything else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, now that I think of it. Sabbah introduced marijuana to the Western
world, from India. The word 'hashish' also comes from his name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a heavy case,&quot; Saul said, &quot;and now that I can walk
out of the phone booth without shocking the patrol-</p>
<p>man in the hall, I'll get back to work on it. Don't say anything that'll get
me aroused again. Please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won't. I'll just lie here naked and . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she said, laughing.</p>
<p>Saul hung up frowning. Goodman's intuition, the other detectives call it.
It's not intuition; it's a way of thinking beyond and between the facts, a way
of sensing <i>wholes, </i>of seeing that there must be a relationship between
fact number one and fact number two even if no such relationship is visible yet.
And I know. There is an Illuminati, whether or not those kids at Berkeley are
kidding.</p>
<p>He came out of his concentration and realized where he was. For the first
time, he noticed a sticker on the door:</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THIS PHONE BOOTH RESERVED FOR CLARK KENT</span></b></p>
<p>He grinned: an intellectual's kind of joke. Probably somebody on the
magazine.</p>
<p>He walked back to the cafeteria, reflecting. &quot;Nothing is true.
Everything is permissible.&quot; With a doctrine like that, people were capable
of ... He shuddered. Images of Buchenwald and Belsen, of Jews who might have
been him. . . .</p>
<p>Peter Jackson looked up as he reentered the cafeteria. An intelligent,
curious black face. Muldoon was as impassive as the faces on Mount Rushmore.
&quot;Mad Dog, Texas, was the town where Malik thought these . . . assassins . .
. had their headquarters,&quot; Muldoon said. &quot;That's where the staff
writer was sent&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was the staff writer's name?&quot; Saul asked.</p>
<p>&quot;George Dorn,&quot; Muldoon said. &quot;He's a young kid who used to be
in SDS. And he was once rather close to the Weatherman faction.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard Celine's gigantic computer, FUCKUP-First Universal
Cybernetic-Kinetic-Ultramicro-Programmer- was basically a rather sophisticated
form of the standard self-programming algorithmic logic machine of the time; the
name was one of his whimsies. FUCKUP's real claim to uniqueness was a programmed
stochastic process whereby it could &quot;throw&quot; an <i>I Ching </i>hexagram,
reading' a random open circuit as a broken <i>(yin) </i>line and a random closed
circuit as a full <i>(yang) </i>line until six such &quot;lines&quot; were
round. Consulting its memory banks, where the</p>
<p>whole tradition of <i>1 Ching </i>interpretation was stored, and then
cross-checking its current scannings of that day's political, economic,
meterological, astrological, astronomical, and technological eccentricities, it
would provide a reading of the hexagram which, to Hagbard's mind, combined the
best of the scientific and occult methods for spotting oncoming trends. On March
13, the stochastic pattern spontaneously generated Hexagram 23, &quot;Breaking
Apart.&quot; FUCKUP then interpreted:</p>
<p>This traditionally unlucky sign was cast by Atlantean scientist-priests
shortly before the destruction of their continent and is generally connected
with death by water. Other vibrations link it to earthquakes, tornadoes and
similar disasters, and to sickness, decay, and morbidity as well.</p>
<p>The first correlation is with the unbalance between technological
acceleration and political retrogression, which has proceeded earthwide at
everwidening danger levels since 1914 and especially since 1964. The breaking
apart is fundamentally the schizoid and schismatic mental fugue of
lawyer-politicians attempting to administrate a worldwide technology whose
mechanisms they lack the education to comprehend and whose gestalttrend they
frustrate by breaking apart into obsolete Rennaisance nation-states.</p>
<p>World War III is probably imminent and, considering the advances in
chemicalbiological warfare in conjunction with the sickness vibrations of
Hexagram 23, the unleashing of plague or nervegas or both is as probable as
thermonuclear overkill.</p>
<p>General prognosis: many megadeaths.</p>
<p>There is some hope for avoidance of the emerging pattern with prompt action
of correct nature. Probability of such avoidance is 0.17 ± 0.05.</p>
<p>No blame.</p>
<p>&quot;My <i>ass, </i>no blame,&quot; Hagbard raged; and rapidly reprogrammed
FUCKUP to read off to him its condensed psychobiographies of the key figures in
world politics and the key scientists in chemobiological warfare.</p>
<p><i>The first dream came to Dr. Charles Mocenigo on February 2-more than a
month before FUCKUP picked upthe vibrations. He was, as usual with him, aware
that he was dreaming, and the vision of a gigantic pyramid which seemed to walk
or lumber' about meant nothing and quickly vanished. Now he seemed to be looking
at an enlargement of the DNA double helix; it was so detailed that he began
searching it for the bonding irregularities at every 23rd Angstrom. To his
surprise, they were missing; instead, there were other irregularities at each
17th Angstrom. &quot;What the devil </i>. . . ?&quot; <i>he asked-and the
pyramid returned seeming to speak and saying, &quot;Yes, the devil.&quot; He
jolted awake, with a new concept, Anthrax-Leprosy-Mu, coming into consciousness,
and began jotting in his bedside pad.</i></p>
<p>&quot;What the hell is this Desert Door project?&quot; the President had
asked once, scrutinizing the budget. &quot;Germ warfare,&quot; an aide explained
helpfully. &quot;They started with something called Anthrax Delta and now
they've worked their way up to something called Anthrax Mu and . . . &quot; His
voice was drowned out by the rumble of paper shredders in the next room. The
President recognized the characteristic sound of the &quot;cesspool
cleaners&quot; hard at work. &quot;Never mind,&quot; he said. &quot;Those things
make me nervous.&quot; He scribbled a quick &quot;OK&quot; next to the item and
went on to &quot;Deprived Children,&quot; which made him feel better.
&quot;Here,&quot; he said, &quot;this is something we can cut&quot;</p>
<p>He forgot everything about Desert Door, until the Fernando Poo crises.
&quot;Suppose, just suppose,&quot; he asked the Joint Chiefs on March 29, I go
on the tube and threaten all-out thermonuclear <i>heck, </i>and the other side
doesn't blink. Have we got something that'll scare them even more?&quot;</p>
<p>The J.C.'s exchanged glances. One of them spoke tentatively. &quot;Out near
Las Vegas,&quot; he said, &quot;we have this Desert Door project that seems to
be way ahead of the Comrades in b-b and b-c-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's biological-bacteriological and biological-chemical,&quot; the
President explained to the Vice-President, who was frowning. &quot;It has
nothing to do with B-B guns.&quot; Turning his attention back to the military
men, he asked, &quot;What have we got specifically that will curdle Ivan's
blood?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there's Anthrax-Leprosy-Mu. . . . It's worse than any form of
anthrax. More deadly than bubonic and anthrax and leprosy all in one lump. As a
matter of fact,&quot; the General who was speaking smiled grimly at the thought,
&quot;our evaluation suggests that &quot;with death being so quick, the
psychological demoralization of the survivors-if there are any survivors-will be
even worse than in thermonuclear exchange with maximum 'dirty* fallout.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By golly,&quot; the President said. &quot;By <i>golly. </i>We won't use
that out in the open. My speech'll just talk Bomb, but we'll leak it to the boys
in the Kremlin that we've got this anthrax gimmick in cold storage, too. By
gosh, you just wait and see them back down.&quot; He stood up, decisive, firm,
the image he always projected on television. &quot;I'm going to see my
speechwriters right now. Meanwhile, arrange that the brain responsible for this
Anthrax-Pi gets a raise. What's his name?&quot; he asked over his shoulder going
out the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Mocenigo. Dr. Charles Mocenigo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A raise for Dr. Charles Mocenigo,&quot; the President called from the
hallway.</p>
<p>&quot;Mocenigo?&quot; the Vice-President asked thoughtfully. &quot;Is he a
wop?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't say wop,&quot; the President shouted back. &quot;How many times
do I have to tell you? Don't say wop or kike or <i>any of </i>those words
anymore.&quot; He spoke with some asperity, since he lived daily with the dread
that someday the secret tapes he kept of all&quot; Oval Room transactions would
be released to the public. He had long ago vowed that if that day ever came, the
tapes would not be full of &quot;(expletive deleted)&quot; or
&quot;(characterization deleted).&quot; He was harassed, but still he spoke with
authority. He was, in fact, characteristic of the best type of dominant male in
the world at this time. He was fifty-five years old, tough, shrewd, unburdened
by the complicated ethical ambiguities which puzzle intellectuals, and had long
ago decided that the world was a mean son-of-a-bitch in which only the most
cunning and ruthless can survive. He was also as kind as was possible for one
holding that ultra-Darwinian philosophy; and he genuinely loved children and
dogs, unless they were on the site of something that had to be bombed in the
National Interest. He still retained some sense of humor, despite the burdens of
his almost godly office, and, although he had been impotent with his wife for
nearly ten years now, he generally achieved orgasm in the mouth of a skilled
prostitute within 1.5 minutes. He took amphetamine pep pills to keep going on
his grueling twenty-hour day, with the result that his vision of the world was
somewhat skewed in a paranoid direction, and he took tranquilizers to keep from
worrying too much, with the result that his detachment sometimes bordered on the
schizophrenic; but most of the time his innate shrewdness gave him a fingernail
grip on reality. In short, he was much like the rulers of Russia and China.</p>
<p>In Central Park, the squirrel woke again as a car honked loudly in passing.
Muttering angrily, he leaped to another tree and immediately went back to sleep.
<i>At the all-night Bickford's restaurant on Seventy-second Street, a young man
named August Personage left a phone booth after making an obscene call to a
woman in Brooklyn; he left behind one of his </i>THIS PHONE BOOTH RESERVED FOR
CLARK KENT <i>stickers. </i>In Chicago, one hour earlier on the clock but the
same instant, the phone booth closed, a rock group called Clark Kent and His
Supermen began a revival of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;: their leader, a
tall black man with a master's degree in anthropology, had been known as El Hajj
Starkerlee Mohammed during a militant phase a few years earlier, and his birth
certificate said Robert Pearson on it. He was observing his audience and noted
that that bearded young white cat, Simon, was with a black woman as usual-a
fetish Pearson-Mohammed-Kent could understand by reverse psychology, since he
preferred white chicks himself. Simon, for once, was not entranced by the music;
instead, he was deep in conversation with the girl and drawing a diagram of a
pyramid on the table to explain what he meant. &quot;Crown Point,&quot; Pearson
heard him say over the music. <i>And listen' ing to &quot;Rock Around the
Clock&quot; ten years earlier, George Dorn had decided to let his hair grow
long, smoke dope and become a musician. He had succeeded in two of those
ambitions. </i>The statue of Tlaloc in the Museum of Anthropology, Mexico, D.F.,
stared inscrutably upward, toward the stars . . . <i>and the same stars
glittered above the 'Carribean where the porpoise named Howard sported in the
waves.</i></p>
<p>The motorcade passes the Texas School Book Depository and moves slowly toward
the Triple Underpass. At the sixth-floor window, Lee Harvey Oswald sights
carefully through the Carcano-Mannlicher: his mouth is dry, desert dry. But his
heartbeat is normal; and no sweat stands out on his forehead. This is the
moment, he is thinking, the one moment transcending time and hazard, heredity
and environment, the final test and proof of free will and of my right to call
myself a man. In this moment, now, as I tighten the trigger, the Tyrant dies,
and with him all the lies of a cruel, mendacious epoch. It is a supreme
exaltation, this moment and this knowledge: and yet his mouth is dry, dust-dry,
dry as death, as if his salivary glands alone rebelled against the murder which
his intellect pronounced necessary and just. <i>Now: </i>He recalls the military
formula BASS: Breathe, Aim, Slack, Squeeze. He breathes, he aims, he slacks, he
starts to squeeze, as a dog barks suddenly-</p>
<p>And his mouth falls open in astonishment as three shots ring out, obviously
from the direction of the Grassy Knoll and Triple Underpass.</p>
<p>&quot;Son-of-a-bitch,&quot; he said, softly as a prayer. And he began to
grin, a rictus not of omnipotence such as he had expected but of something
different and unexpected and therefore better-omniscience. That smirk appeared
in all the photos during the next day and a half, before his own death, a
sneering smile that said so clearly that none dared to read it: <i>I know
something you don't know. </i>That grimace only faded Sunday morning when Jack
Ruby pumped two bullets into Lee's frail fanatic body, and its secret went with
him to the grave. But another part of the secret had already left Dallas on
Friday afternoon's TWA Whisperjet to Los Angeles, traveling behind the business
suit, gray hair, and only moderately sardonic eyes of a little old man who was
listed on the flight manifest as &quot;Frank Sullivan.&quot;</p>
<p><i>This is serious, Peter Jackson was thinking; Joe Malik wasn't on a
paranoid trip at all. The noncommital expressions of Muldoon and Goodman did not
deceive him at all-he had long ago learned the black art of surviving in a white
world, which is the art of reading not what is on a face but what is behind the
face. The cops were worried and excited, like any hunters on the track of
something both large and dangerous. Joe was right about the assassination plot,
and his disappearance and the bombing were part of it. And that meant George
Dorn was in danger, too, and Peter liked George even if he was a snotty kid in
some ways and an annoying ass-kisser about the race thing like most young white
radicals. Mad Dog, Texas, Peter thought: that sure sounds like a bad place to be
in trouble.</i></p>
<p>(Almost fifty years before, a habitual bank robber named Harry Pierpont
approached a young convict in Michigan City Prison and asked him, &quot;Do you
think there might be a true religion?&quot;)</p>
<p>But why is George Dorn screaming while Saul Goodman is reading the memos?
Hold on for another jump, and this one is a shocker. Saul is no longer human;
he's a pig. All cops are pigs. Everything you've ever believed is probably a
lie. The world is a dark, sinister, mysterious and totally frightening place.
Can you digest all that quickly? Then, walk into the mind of George Dorn for the
second time, five hours before the explosion at <i>Confrontation </i>(four hours
before, on the clock) and suck on the joint, suck hard and hold it down.
(&quot;One o'clock . . . two o'clock . . . three o'clock . . . ROCK!&quot;). You
are sprawled on a crummy bed in a rundown hotel, and a neon light outside is
flashing pink and blue patterns into your room. Exhale slowly, feel the hit of
the weed and see if the wallpaper looks any brighter yet, any less Unintentional
Low Camp. It's hot, Texas-dry hot, and you push your long hair back from your
forehead and haul out your diary, George Dorn, because reading over what you
wrote last sometimes helps you to learn what you're really getting into. As the
neon splotches the page with pink and blue, read this:</p>
<p>April 23</p>
<p>How do we know whether the universe is getting bigger or the objects in it
are getting smaller? You can't say that the universe is getting bigger in
relation to anything outside it, because there isn't any outside for it to
relate to. There isn't any outside. But if the universe doesn't have an
out-side, then it goes on forever. Yeah, but, its inside doesn't go on forever.
How do you know it doesn't, shithead? You're just playing with words, man.</p>
<p>-No I'm not. The universe is the inside without an outside, the sound made by
one</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>The Fear came over George. Whenever he was high, the least little detail
wrong in his world would bring the Fear, irresistible, uncontrollable. He held
his breath, not to contain the smoke in his lungs, but because terror had
paralyzed the muscles in his chest. He dropped the little notebook in which he
wrote his thoughts daily and clutched at his penis, a habitual gesture in
moments of panic. The hand holding the roach drifted, automatically, over the
hollowed-out copy of Sinclair Lewis's <i>It Can't Happen Here, </i>which lay
beside him on the bed, and he dropped the half-inch twist of paper and marijuana
on top of the plastic Baggie full of green grains. Instantly a brown smoldering
dime-sized hole opened up on the bag, and the pot near the coal started to
smoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Stupid,&quot; said George, as his thumb stabbed the smoking coal to
crush it, and he drew back his lips in a grim-ace of pain.</p>
<p>A short fat man walked into the room, Law Officer written in every mean line
of his crafty little face. George shrank back and started to close <i>It</i> <i>Can't
Happen Here; </i>like lightning, three stiff, concrete-hard fingers drove into
his forearm. He screamed and the book jumped out of his hand, spilling pot all
over the bedspread.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't touch that,&quot; said the fat man. &quot;An officer will be in
to gather it up for evidence. I went easy with that karate punch. Otherwise
you'd be nursing a compound fracture of the left arm in Mad Dog County Jail
tonight, and no right-thinking doctor likely to have a mind to come out and
treat you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You got a warrant?&quot; George tried to sound defiant.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you think you have cojones.&quot; The fat man's breath stank of
bourbon and cheap cigars. &quot;Rabbit cojones. I have terrified you unto death,
boy, and you know it and I know it, yet you find it in your heart to speak of
warrants. Next you'll want to see the American Civil Liberties Union.&quot; He
pulled aside the jacket of an irridescent gray summer suit that might have been
new when <i>Heartbreak Hotel </i>was the top of the hit parade. A silver
five-pointed star decorated his pink shirt pocket and a .45 automatic stuck in
his pants-top dented the fat of his belly. &quot;That is all the law I need when
dealing with your type in Mad Dog. Walk careful with me, son, or you won't have
nothing to grab onto next time one of us pigs as you choose to call us in your
little articles, busts in on you. Which is not likely to happen in the next
forty years, while you rot and grow old in our state prison.&quot; He seemed
immensely pleased with his own oratorical style, like one of Faulkner's
characters. George thought:</p>
<p>It is forbidden to dream again; We maim our joys or hide them; Horses are
made of chromium steel And little fat men shall ride them.</p>
<p>He said, &quot;You can't hit me with forty years for possession. And grass is
legal in most other states. This law is archaic and absurd.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shit and onions, boy, you got too much of the killer weed there to call
it mere possession. I call it possession with intent to sell. And the laws of
this state are stern, and they are just and they are our laws. We know what that
weed can do. We remember the Alamo and Santa Anna's troops losing all fear
because they were high on Rosa Maria, as they called it in those days. Get on
your feet. And don't ask to talk to a lawyer, neither.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can I ask who you are?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am Sheriff Jim Cartwright, nemesis of all evil in Mad Dog and Mad Dog
County.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I'm Tiny Tim,&quot; said George, immediately saying to himself,
Shut the fuck up, you're too goddamn high. And he went right on and said,
&quot;Maybe your side would have won if Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie got stoned,
too. And, by the way, Sheriff, how did you know you could catch me with pot?
Usually an underground journalist would make it a point to be clean when he
comes into this godforsaken part of the country. It wasn't telepathy that told
you I had pot on me.&quot;</p>
<p>Sheriff Cartwright slapped his thigh. &quot;Oh, but it was. It <i>was </i>telepathy.
Now just what made you think it wasn't telepathy brung me here?&quot; He
laughed, seized George's arm in a grip of iron, and pushed him toward the
hotel-room door. George felt a bottomless terror as if the pit of hell were
opening beneath his feet and Sheriff Jim Cartwright were about to pitchfork him
into the bubbling sulfur. And I must admit that was more or less the case; there
are periods of history when the visions of madmen and dope fiends are a better

<p><i>(&quot;Keep on hanging out with those wild boys from Passaic and you'll
end up in jail,&quot; George's mother said. &quot;You mark my words,
George.&quot; And, another time, at Columbia, after a very late meeting, Mark
Rudd said soberly, &quot;A lot of us are going to spend some time in the Man's
jails before this shit-storm is over&quot;; and George, together with the
others, nodded glumly but bravely. </i>The marijuana he had been smoking was
raised in Cuernavaca by a farmer named Arturo Jesus Maria Ybarra y Mendez, who
had sold it in bulk to a young <i>Yanqui </i>named Jim Riley, the son of a
Dayton, Ohio, police officer, who in turn smuggled it through Mad Dog after
paying a suitable bribe to Sheriff Jim Cartwright. After that it was resold to a
Times Square dealer called Rosetta the Stoned and a Miss Walsh from <i>Confrontation's
</i>research department bought ten ounces from her, later reselling five ounces
to George, who then carried it back to Mad Dog without any suspicion that he was
virtually completing a cycle. The original seed was part of that strain
recommended by General George Washington in the famous letter to Sir John
Sinclair in which he writes, &quot;I find that, for all purposes, the Indian
hemp is in every way superior to the New Zealand variety previously cultivated
here.&quot; <i>In New York, Rebecca Goodman, deciding that Saul will not be home

<p>George's cellmate in Mad Dog County Jail had a skull-like face with large,
protruding front teeth. He was about six and a half feet tall and lay curled up
on his cell bunk like a coiled python.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you asked for treatment?&quot; George asked him.</p>
<p>&quot;Treatment for what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if you think you're an assassin-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think, baby brother. I've killed four white men and two
niggers. One in California, the rest down here. Got paid for every one of
them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that what you're in for?&quot; My God, they don't stick murderers in
the same cell with potheads, do they?</p>
<p>&quot;I'm in for vagrancy,&quot; said the man scornfully. &quot;Actually, I'm
just here for safekeeping, till they give me my orders. Then it's good-bye to
whoever-President, civil rights leader, enemy of the people. Someday I'll be
famous. I'm gonna write a book about myself someday, Ace. Course, I'm no good at
writing. Look, maybe we can do a deal. I'll have Sheriff Jim bring you some
writing paper if you'll write about my life. They gonna keep you here forever,
you know. I'll come and visit you between assassinations, and you'll write the
book, and Sheriff Jim'11 keep it safe till I retire. Then you have the book
published and you'll make a lot of money and be real comfortable in jail. Or
maybe you can even hire a lawyer to get you out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where will you be?&quot; said George. He was still scared, but he was
feeling sleepy, too, and he was deciding that this was all bullshit, which had a
calming effect on his nerves. But he'd better not go to sleep in the cell while
this guy was awake. He didn't really believe this assassin talk, but it was safe
to assume that anybody you met in prison was homosexual.</p>
<p>As if reading his mind, his cellmate said, &quot;How'd you like to let a
famous assassin shove it up to you? How would that be, huh, Ace?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please,&quot; said George. &quot;That's not my bag, you know? I really
couldn't do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shit, piss, and corruption,&quot; said the assassin. He suddenly
uncoiled and slid off the bunk. &quot;I been wasting my time with you. Now bend
the hell over and drop your pants. You are getting it, and there ain't no
further way about it.&quot; He stepped toward George, fists clenched.</p>
<p>&quot;Guard! Guard!&quot; George yelled. He grabbed the cell door in both
hands and began rattling it frantically.</p>
<p>The man caught George a cuff across the face. Another blow to the jaw knocked
George against the wall.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Guard!&quot; </i>he screamed, his head spinning with pot and panic.</p>
<p>A man in a blue uniform came through the door at the end of the corridor. He
seemed miles away and vastly disinterested, like a god who had grown bored with
his creations.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, what the hell is all this yelling about in here?&quot; he asked,
his hand en the butt of his revolver, his voice still miles away.</p>
<p>George opened his mouth, but his cellmate spoke first 'This little
long-haired communist freak won't drop his pants when I tell him. Ain't you
supposed to make sure I'm happy in here?&quot; The voice shifted to a whine.
&quot;Make him do what I say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've got to protect me,&quot; said George. &quot;You've got to get me
out of this cell.&quot;</p>
<p>The god-guard laughed. &quot;Well, now, you might say this is a very
enlightened prison we have here. You come down from New York and you probably
think we're pretty backward. But we ain't. We got no police brutality. Now, if I
interfered between you and Harry Coin here, I might have to use force to keep
him away from your young ass. I know you people believe all cops ought to be
abolished. Well, in this here situation I hereby abolish myself. Furthermore, I
know you people believe in sexual freedom, and I do, too. So Harry Coin gonna
have his sexual freedom without any interference or brutality from me.&quot; His
voice was still distant and disinterested, almost dreamy.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said George.</p>
<p>The guard drew his pistol. &quot;Now, sonny. You take down your pants and
bend over. You are gonna get it up the ass from Harry Coin here, and no two ways
about it And I am gonna watch and see that you let him do it right. Otherwise,
you get no forty years. You get killed, right now. I put a bullet in you and I
say you are resisting arrest. Now make up your mind what it's gonna be. I really
will kill you if you don't do like he tells you to. I really will. You are
totally expendable and he ain't. He's a very important man, and it's my job to
keep him happy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I'll fuck you either way, dead or alive,&quot; the demented Coin
laughed, like an evil spirit. &quot;So there's no way you can escape it,
Ace.&quot;</p>
<p>The door at the end of the corridor clanged, and Sheriff Jim Cartwright and
two blue-uniformed policemen strode down to the cell. &quot;What's going on
here?&quot; said the Sheriff.</p>
<p>&quot;I caught this queer punk George Dorn here trying to commit homosexual
rape on Harry,&quot; said the guard. &quot;Had to draw my pistol to stop
him.&quot;</p>
<p>George shook his head. &quot;You guys are unbelievable. If you're acting out
this little game for my benefit, you can quit now, because you're certainly not
fooling each other, and you're not fooling me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dorn,&quot; said the Sheriff, &quot;you've been attempting unnatural
acts in my jail, acts forbidden by the Holy Bible and the laws of this state. I
don't like that. I don't like it one little bit. Come on out here. I wanna have
a little talk with you. We goin' to the main interrogation room for some speakin'
together.&quot;</p>
<p>He unlocked the cell door and motioned George to precede him. He turned to
the two policemen who had accompanied him. &quot;Stay behind and take care of
that other <i>little matter.&quot; </i>The last words were strangely emphasized.</p>
<p>George and the Sheriff walked through a series of corridors and locked doors
until at last they came to a room whose walls were made of embossed sheet tin
painted bottle-green. The Sheriff told George to sit on one chair, while he
straddled the back of the chair facing him.</p>
<p>&quot;You're a bad influence on my prisoners,&quot; he said. &quot;I got a
good mind to see that some kind of accident happens to you. I don't want to see
you corrupting prisoners in my jail-mine or anyone's-for forty years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sheriff,&quot; said George. &quot;What do you want from me? You got me
on a pot charge. What more do you want? Why did you stick me in that cell with
that guy? What's all this scare stuff and threats and questioning for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wanna know some things,&quot; said the Sheriff. &quot;I want to find
out everything you can tell me about certain matters. So, from this moment be
prepared to tell me only the truth. If you do, maybe things will go easier on
you, after.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sheriff,&quot; said George. Cartwright squinted at him. He really
does look like a pig, thought George. Most do. Why do so many of them get so fat
and have such little eyes?</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; said the Sheriff. &quot;What was your purpose in
coming down here from New York?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm simply on an assignment from <i>Confrontation, </i>the
magazine-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know it. It is a smutty magazine, and a communist magazine. I have
read it&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're using loaded words. It's a left-wing libertarian magazine, to be
exact&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My pistol is loaded, too, boy. So talk straight All right Tell me what
you came down here to write about&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. You ought to be as interested in this as I am, if you're really
interested in law and order. There have been rumors circulating throughout the
country for more than a decade now that all the major political assassinations
in America-Malcolm X, the Kennedy brothers, Medgar Evers, King, Nixon, maybe
even George Lincoln Rockwell-are the work of a single, conspiratorial,
violence-oriented right-wing organization, and that this organization has its
base right here in Mad Dog. I came down to see what I could find out about this
group.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's what I figured,&quot; said the Sheriff. &quot;You poor, sad
little turd. You come down here with your long hair and you expect to get, as
you put it, a line on a right-wing organization. Why, it's lucky for you you
didn't meet any of our real right-wingers, like God's Lightning for instance.
The ones around here would have tortured you to death by this tune, boy. You
really are dumb. OK, I'm not gonna waste any more of my time with you. Come on,
I'll take you back to your cell. You might as well get used to looking at the
moon through bars.&quot;</p>
<p>They walked back the same way they had come. At the entrance to the corridor
where George's cell was, the Sheriff opened the door and yelled, &quot;Come and
get him, Charley.&quot;</p>
<p>George's guard, his face pale and his mouth set in a lipless line, took
George by the arm. The corridor door clanged shut behind the Sheriff. Charley
took George to his cell and pushed him in wordlessly. But at least he was
three-dimensional now and less like a marijuana phantom.</p>
<p>Harry Coin wasn't there. The cell was empty. George became aware of a shadow
in the corner of bis vision. Something in the cell next to him. He turned: His
heart stopped. There was a man hanging from a pipe on the ceiling. George went
over and stared through the bars. The body was swaying slightly. It was attached
to the pipe by a leather belt which was buckled around the neck. The face, with
the staring eyes, was that of Harry Coin. George's glance went lower. Something
was coming out of</p>
<p>Harry Coin's midsection and was dangling down to the floor. It wasn't
suicide. They had disemboweled Harry Coin, and someone had thoughtfully moved a
shit-can under him for his bloody intestines to dangle into.</p>
<p>George screamed. There was no one around to answer him. The guard had
vanished like Hermes.</p>
<p>(But in Cherry Knolls mental hospital in Sunderland, England, where it was
already eleven the following morning, a schizophrenic patient who hadn't spoken
in ten years abruptly began exhorting a ward attendant: &quot;They're all coming
back-Hitler, Goering, Streicher, the whole lot of them. And, behind them, the
powers and persons from the other spheres who control them. . . .&quot; But
Simon Moon in Chicago still calmly and placidly retains the lotus position and
instructs Mary Lou sitting in his lap: &quot;Just hold it, hold it with your
vaginal wall like you'd hold it with your hand, gently, and feel its warmth, but
don't think about orgasm, don't think about the future, not even a minute ahead,
think about the now, the only now, the only now, the only now that we'll ever
have, just my penis in your vagina now and the simple pleasure of it, not a
greater pleasure to work toward. . . .&quot; &quot;My back hurts,&quot; Mary Lou
said.)</p>
<p>WE'RE GONNA ROCK ROCK ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK</p>
<p>TO NIGHT</p>
<p>There are Swedish and Norwegian kids, Danes, Italian and French kids, Greeks,
even Americans. George and Hagbard move through the crowd trying to estimate its
number-200,000? 300,000? 500,000? Peace symbols dangling about every neck, nudes
with body paint, nudes without body paint, long and dangling hair on boys and
girls alike, and over all of it the hypnotic and unending beat. &quot;Woodstock
Europa,&quot; Hagbard says drily. &quot;The last and final Walpurgisnacht and
Adam Weishaupt's Erotion finally realized.&quot;</p>
<p>WE'RE GONNA ROCK ROCK ROCK TILL BROAD</p>
<p>DAYLIGHT</p>
<p>&quot;It's a League of Nations,&quot; George says, &quot;a young people's
League of Nations.&quot; Hagbard isn't listening. &quot;Up there,&quot; he
points, &quot;to the Northwest is the Rhine, where <i>die Lorelei </i>was
supposed to sit and sing her deadly songs. There will be deadlier music on the
Danube tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>WE'RE GONNA ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TONIGHT</p>
<p>(But that was still seven days in the future, and now</p>
<p>George lies unconscious in Mad Dog County Jail. And it began-that phase of
the operation, as Hagbard called it-over thirty years before when a Swiss
chemist named Hoffman climbed on his bicycle and pedaled down a country road
into new dimensions.)</p>
<p>&quot;And will they all come back?&quot; George asked.</p>
<p>&quot;All of them,&quot; Hagbard answered tightly. &quot;When the beat
reaches the proper intensity . . . unless we can stop it.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;Now I'm getting it,&quot; Mary Lou cried. &quot;It's not what I
expected. It's different from sex, and better.&quot; Simon smiled benignly.
&quot;It <i>is </i>sex, baby,&quot; he said. &quot;What you've had before wasn't
sex. Now we can start moving . . . but slowly ... the Gentle Way ... the Way of
Tao. . . .&quot; <i>They're all coming back; they never died-</i>the lunatic
raved at the startled attendant-<i>You wait, guvnor. You just wait. You'll see
it.)</i></p>
<p>The amplifiers squealed suddenly. There was too much feedback, and the sound
went off into a pitch beyond endurance. George winced, and saw others hold their
ears. ROCK, ROCK, ROCK, AROUND THE CLOCK. <i>The key missed the lock, turned and
cut Muldoon's hand. </i>&quot;Nerves,&quot; he said to Saul. &quot;I always feel
like a burglar when I do this.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul grunted. &quot;Forget burglary,&quot; he said. &quot;We might be hanged
for treason before this is over. If we don't become national heroes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A fanfuckingtastic case,&quot; Muldoon grinned. He tried another way.</p>
<p>They were in an old brownstone on Riverside Drive, trying to break into the
apartment of Joseph Malik. And they were not merely looking for evidence, both
tacitly admitted-they were hiding from the FBI.</p>
<p><i>The call had come from headquarters just as they were finishing the
questioning of associate editor Peter Jackson. Muldoon had gone out to his car
to take it, while Saul finished getting a full physical description of both
Malik and George Dorn. Jackson had just left and Saul was picking up the fifth
memo, when Muldoon returned, looking as if his doctor had just told him his
Wasserman was positive.</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Two special agents from the FBI are coming over to help us,&quot; he
said woodenly.</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Still ready to play a hunch?&quot; Saul asked calmly, pushing all
the memos back in the metal box.</i></p>
<p><i>Muldoon merely called Pricefixer back into the cafeteria and told him,
&quot;Two feds will be here in a few minutes. Tell them we went back to
headquarters. Answer any question they ask, but don't tell them about this
box.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>Pricefixer looked at the two older officers carefully and then said to
Muldoon, &quot;You're the boss.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>He's either awfully dumb and trusting, Saul had thought, or he's so damned
smart he's going to be dangerous someday.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; he asked Muldoon nervously, &quot;is that the last
key?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I've got five more beauties here and one of them will-here it
is!&quot; The door opened smoothly.</p>
<p>Saul's hand drifted toward his revolver as he stepped into the apartment and
felt for a light switch. Nobody was revealed when the light came on, and Saul
relaxed. &quot;You look around for the dogs.&quot; he said. &quot;I want to sit
down and go over the rest of these memos.&quot;</p>
<p>The room was used for work as well as living and was untidy enough to leave
no room for doubt that Malik had been a bachelor. Saul pushed the typewriter
back on the writing desk, set down the memo box and then noticed something odd.
The whole wall, on this side of the room, was covered with pictures of George
Washington. Standing to examine them more closely, he saw that each had a
label-half of them saying &quot;G.W.&quot; and the others, &quot;A.W.&quot;</p>
<p>Odd-but the whole case had overtones that smelled as fishy as those dead
Egyptian mouth-breeders.</p>
<p>Saul sat down and took a memo from the box.</p>
<p>Muldoon came back into the living room and said, &quot;No dogs. Not a goddam
dog anywhere in the whole apartment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's interesting,&quot; Saul remarked thoughtfully. &quot;You say the
landlord had complaints from several other tenants about the dogs?&quot; ;</p>
<p>&quot;He said everybody in the building was complaining. The rule is no pets
and he enforced it. People wanted to know why they had to get rid of their
kittens when Malik could have a whole pack of dogs up here. They said there must
have been ten or twelve from the noise they made.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He sure must love those animals, if he took them all with him when he
went into hiding,&quot; Saul mused. The pole vaulter in his unconscious was
jumping again. &quot;Let's look in the kitchen,&quot; he suggested mildly.</p>
<p>Barney followed as Saul methodically ransacked the refrigerator and
cupboards, finishing up with a careful examination of the garbage.</p>
<p>&quot;No dog food,&quot; Saul said finally.</p>
<p>&quot;I noticed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And no dog dishes either. And no empty dog-food tins in the
garbage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What wild notion are you following now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Saul said thoughtfully. &quot;He doesn't mind the
neighbors hearing the dogs-probably he's the land of left-wing individualist who
likes nothing better than quarreling with his landlord and the other tenants
about some issue like the no-pets rule. So he wasn't hiding anything until he
ducked out And then he not only took the dogs but hid all evidence that they'd
ever been here. Even though he must have known that the neighbors would all talk
about them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe he was feeding them human flesh,&quot; Muldoon suggested
ghoulishly.</p>
<p>&quot;Lord, I don't know. You look around for anything of interest. I'm going
to read those Illuminati memos.&quot; Saul returned to the living room and
began:</p>
<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO <i>#5</i></p>
<p>7/26</p>
<p>J.M.:</p>
<p>Sometimes you find things in the damnedest places. The following is from a
girl's magazine ('The Conspiracy&quot; by Sandra Glass, <i>Teenset, </i>March
1969, pages 34-40).</p>
<p>Simon proceeded to tell me about the Bavarian Illuminati. The nightmarish
story begins in 1090 A.D. in the Middle East when Hassan i Sabbah founded the
Ismaelian Sect, or <i>Hashishim, </i>so called because of their use of hashish,
a deadly drug derived from the hemp plant which is better known as the killer
weed marijuana. . . . The cult terrorized the Moslem world until Genghis Khan's
Mongols brought law and order to the area. Cornered in their mountain hideaway,
the Hashishim dope fiends proved no match for the clean-living Mongol warriors,
their fortress was destroyed, and their dancing girls shipped</p>
<p>to Mongolia for rehabilitation. The heads of the cult fled westward. . . .</p>
<p>&quot;The Illuminati surfaced next in Bavaria in 1776,&quot; Simon told me. .
. . &quot;Adam Weishaupt, a student of the occult, studied the teachings of
Hassan i Sabbah and grew hemp in his backyard. On February 2, 1776, Weishaupt
achieved illumination. Weishaupt officially founded the Ancient Illuminated
Seers of Bavaria on May 1st, 1776. Their slogan was <i>'Ewige Blumenkraft.' </i>.
. . They attracted many illustrious members such as Goethe and Beethoven.
Beethoven tacked up an <i>Ewige Blumenkraft </i>poster on the top of the piano
on which he composed all nine of his symphonies.&quot;</p>
<p>The last paragraph of the article is, however, the most interesting of all:</p>
<p>Recently I saw a documentary film on the Democratic Convention of 1968, and I
was struck by the scene in which Senator Abraham Ribicoff made a critical remark
provoking the anger of the Mayor of Chicago. In the ensuing tumult it was
impossible to hear the Mayor's shouted retort, and there has been much
speculation about what he actually said. To me it seemed his lips were forming
the words that by this time become frighteningly familiar: <i>&quot;Ewige
Blumenkraft!&quot;</i></p>
<p>The further I dig, the wilder the whole picture looks. When are we going to
tell George about it?</p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The John Birch Society has looked
into the subject and they have a theory of their own. The first source I've
found on this is a pamphlet &quot;CFR: Conspiracy to Rule the World&quot; by
Gary Alien, associate editor of the Birchers' magazine, <i>American Opinion. </i>Alien's
thesis is that Cecil Rhodes created a secret soci</span>ety to establish English
domination of the world in 1888. This society acts through Oxford University,
the Rhodes Scholarships and-hold your breath-the Council on Foreign Relations, a
nonprofit foundation for the study of International Affairs headquartered right
here on Sixty-eighth Street in New York. Seven out of nine of our last
Secretaries of State were recruited from the CFR, Alien points out, and dozens
of other leading politicians as well-including Richard Nixon. It is also
implied, but not directly stated, that William Buckley, Jr. (an old enemy of the
Birchers) is another tool of the CFR; and the Morgan and Rothschild banking
interests are supposed to be financing the whole thing.</p>
<p>How does this tie in with the Illuminati? Mr. Alien merely drops hints,
linking Rhodes to John Ruskin, and Ruskin to earlier internationalists, and
finally stating that &quot;the originator on the profane level of this type of
secret society&quot; was Adam Weishaupt, whom he calls &quot;the monster who
founded the Order of the Illuminati on May 1, 1776.&quot;</p>

<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO <i>#7</i></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></i>7/27</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p>This is from a small left-wing newspaper in Chicago <i>(The Roger</i>SPARK<i>
</i>Chicago, July 1969, Vol. 2, No. 9: &quot;Daley Linked With Illuminati,&quot;
no author's name given):</p>
<p>No historian knows what happened to Adam Weishaupt after he was exiled from
Bavaria in 1785, and entries in &quot;Washington's&quot; diary after that date
frequently refer to the hemp crop at Mount Vernon.</p>
<p>The possibility that Adam Weishaupt killed George Washington and took his
place, serving as our first President for two terms, is now confirmed. . . . The
two main colors of the American flag are, excluding a small patch of blue in one
corner, red and white: these are also the official colors of the Hashishim. The
flag and the Illuminati pyramid both have thirteen horizontal divisions:
thirteen is, of course, the traditional code for marijuana . . . and is still
used in that sense by Hell's Angels among others.</p>
<p>Now, &quot;Washington&quot; formed the Federalist party.</p>
<p>The other major party in those days, The Democratic Republicans, was formed
by Thomas Jefferson [and] there are grounds for accepting the testimony of the
Reverend Jedediah Morse of Charleston, who accused Jefferson of being an
Illuminati agent. Thus, even at the dawn of our government, both parties were
IIluminati fronts. ...</p>

phrase <i>&quot;Ewige Blumenkraft&quot; </i>during his incoherent diatribe
against Abe Ribicoff.</p>

<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #8</p>
<p>7/27</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.: More on the Washington-Weishaupt
theory:</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that his face appears on billions of stamps and dollar
bills, and his portrait hangs in every public building in the country, no one is
quite sure what Washington looks like. A &quot;Project 20&quot; script,
&quot;Meet George Washington&quot; will be seen tonight at 7:30 on Channel (fill
in by local stations). The program offers contemporary portraits of the first
President, some of which do not even seem to be the same man.</p>
<p>This is a press release sent out by NEC on April 24, 1969. Some of the
portraits can be found in <i>Encyclopedia Britannica </i>and the resemblance to
portraits of Weishaupt is undeniable.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Barbara called my attention to this: the letter in <i>Playboy </i>asking
about the Illuminati was signed &quot;R.S., Kansas City, Missouri.&quot;
According to the Kansas City newspapers, a Robert Stanton of that city was found
dead on March 17, 1969 (about a week after the April <i>Playboy </i>appeared on
the newsstands) with his throat torn as if by the talons of some enormous beast.
No animal was reported missing from any of the local zoos.</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>Saul looked up at the pictures of Washington on the wall. For the first time,
he noticed the strange half-smile on the most famous of them all, the one by
Gilbert Stuart that appears on one-dollar bills. <i>&quot;As if by the talons of
some enormous beast,&quot; he quoted to himself, thinking again of Malik's
disappearing dogs.</i></p>
<p>&quot;What the hell are you grinning about?&quot; he asked sourly.</p>
<p>Congressman Koch, he remembered suddenly, in a speech years and years ago
when marijuana was illegal everywhere, said something about Washington's hemp
crop. What was it? Yes: it was about the entries in the General's diary-they
showed that he separated the female hemp plants from the males before
fertilization. That was botanically unnecessary if he was growing the crop for
rope, but it was standard practise in cultivating hemp for marijuana, Koch
pointed out.</p>
<p>And &quot;illumination&quot; was one of the words hippies were always using
to describe the experience one obtains from the highest grade of grass. Even the
more common term, &quot;turning on,&quot; had the same meaning as
&quot;illumination,&quot; when you stopped to think about. Wasn't that what the
crown of light around Jesus' head in Catholic art was supposed to mean? And
Goethe-if he was really part of this-might have been referring to the experience
in his last words, as he lay dying: &quot;More light!&quot;</p>

<p>And leaving Dallas that much-discussed November 22 afternoon in 1963, the man
using the name &quot;Frank Sullivan&quot; brushes past McCord and Barker at the
airport, but no foreshadowing of Watergate darkens his mind.. (Back at the

that Garrison ever came within light years of the real truth. . . .)</p>
<p><i>&quot;Here, kitty-kitty-kitty,&quot;Hagbard calls.</i></p>
<p>But now we are going back, again, to April 2 and Las Vegas; Sherri Brandi
(nee Sharon O'Farrell) arriving home finds Carmel in her living room at four in
the morning. It doesn't surprise her; he often made these unexpected visits. <i>He
seems to enjoy invading other people's territory like some kinda creepy virus. </i>&quot;Darling,&quot;
I cried, rushing to kiss him as he expected. <i>I</i> <i>wish the creep would
drop dead, </i>I thought as our mouths met.</p>
<p>&quot;An all-night John?&quot; he asked casually.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. One of those scientists who works at that place out in the desert
we're all supposed to pretend we don't know about. A freak.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He wanted something special?&quot; Carmel asked quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;You charged him extra?&quot; At times I thought I could really see
dollar signs in his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;he just wanted a lay. But afterward he wouldn't
let me go. Just kept jawing.&quot; I yawned, looking around at the nice
furniture and the nice paintings; I had managed to get everything in shades of
pink and lavender, really beautiful, if that creep hadn't been sitting there on
the couch looking like a hungry dead rat. I always wanted pretty things and I
think I could have been some kind of artist or designer if all my luck wasn't
always lousy. Christ, who ever told Carmel a blue turtleneck would go with a
brown suit? If it wasn't for women, in my honest-to-Pete opinion, men would all
go around looking like that. That's what I think. Insensitive. A bunch of
cavemen, or Meander Thralls, or whatever you call them. &quot;This John had a
lot on his mind,&quot; I said before old candy-bar could start crossexamining me
about something else. &quot;He's against fluorides in drinking water and the
Catholic church and faggots and he thinks the new birth-control pill is as bad
as the old one and I should use a diaphragm instead. Christ, he's got the inside
dope on everything under the sun, he thinks, and I hadda listen to it all. That
kind of John.&quot;</p>
<p>Carmel nodded. &quot;Scientists are schmucks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>I pulled the dress over my head and hung it in the closet (it was the nice
green one with the spangles and the new style where my nipples stick out through
little holes, which is a pain in the ass because they're always rubbing against
something and getting raw, but it really turns on the Johns, and, like I always
say, that's the name of the game, in this sonofabitching town with all the lousy
luck, the only way to heavy scratch is go out there, girl, and sell your snatch)
and then I grabbed my robe quick before old blow-job bobo decided it was time
for his weekly Frenching. &quot;He's got a nice house, though,&quot; I said to
distract the creep. &quot;He doesn't have to live out there on the base, he's
too important for rules and regularities. Nice to look at, I mean. Redwood walls
and burnt orange decor, you know? Pretty. He hates it, though. Acts as if he
thinks it's haunted by Count Frankenstein or somebody. Keeps jumping up and
walking around like he's looking for something. Something that'll bite his head
off in one gulp if he finds it.&quot; I decided to let the top of the robe hang
open a little. Carmel was either horny or he wanted something else, and <i>something
else </i>with him generally means he thinks you've been holding back some cash.
Him and his damned belt. Of course, sometimes with that I go queer all over for
a flash and I guess that's like the come that men have, the orgasm, but it ain't
worth the pain, believe me. I wonder if it's true some women get it in
intercourse? Really get it? I don't think so. I've never known anybody in the
business who gets it, from a man, only from Rosy Palm and her five sisters,
sometimes, and if none of <i>us </i>do, how could some straight nicey-nicey get
it?</p>
<p>&quot;Bugs,&quot; Carmel said, looking shrewd and clever, off on his usual
shtick of proving he was more hip to everything than anybody else on God's green
earth. I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, bugs?&quot; I asked. It was better than talking about
money.</p>
<p>&quot;The John,&quot; he said with a know-it-all grin. &quot;He's important,
you said. So his house has bugs. He probably keeps taking them out, and the FBI
keeps coming back and putting in new ones. I bet he was very quiet when he was
making it with you, right?&quot; I nodded, remembering. &quot;See. He couldn't
stand the thought of those Feds eavesdropping on the other end of the wire. Just
like Mal-like a guy I know in the Syndicate. He's so afraid of bugs he won't
hold a business talk anywhere but the bathroom in his hotel suite with all four
faucets going full blast and both of us whispering. Running water screws up a
bug more than playing loud music on the radio, for some scientific reason.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bugs,&quot; I said suddenly. &quot;That's it.&quot; The other kind of
bugs. I was remembering Charley raving about fluoridation: &quot;And we're all
classified as mental cases, because a few right-wing nuts fifteen or twenty
years ago who said fluoridation was a communist plot to poison us. Now, anybody
who criticizes fluoridation is supposed to be just as bananas as God's
Lightning. Good Lord, if anybody wants to do us in without firing a shot, I
could-&quot; and he caught himself, hid something that almost showed on his
face, and ended like his brain was walking on one foot, &quot;I could point to a
dozen things in any chemistry book more effective than fluoride.&quot; But he
wasn't thinking of chemicals, he was thinking of those little bugs, microbes is
the word, and that's what he was working on. I could feel that flash I always
get when I read something in a John, like if he had more money than he let on,
or he'd caught his wife spreading for the milkman and was doing it to get even,
or he was really a faggola and was just proving to himself that he wasn't <i>completely
</i>a faggola. &quot;My God,&quot; I said, &quot;Carmel, I read about those
microbe bugs in the <i>Enquirer, </i>If they have an accident out there, this
whole town goes, and the state with it, and God knows how many other states.
Jesus, no wonder he keeps washing his hands!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Germ warfare?&quot; Carmel said, thinking fast. &quot;God, I'll bet
this town is crawling with Russian spies trying to find out what's going on out
there. And I've got a direct lead for them. But how the hell do you meet a
Russian spy, or a Chinese spy for that matter? You can't just advertise in a
newspaper. Hell. Maybe if I went down to the university and talked to some of
those freaking commie students. ...&quot;</p>
<p>I was shocked. &quot;Carmel! You can't sell your own country like that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The hell I can't. The Statue of Liberty is just another broad, and I'll
take what I can get for her. Don't be a fool.&quot; He reached in his jacket
pocket and took out a caramel candy like he always did when he was excited.
&quot;I'll -bet somebody in the Mob will know. They know everything. Jesus,
there has to be <i>some </i>way of cashing in on this.&quot;</p>
<p><i>The Presidents actual television broadcast was transmitted to the world at
10:30 </i>P.M. <i>EST, March 31. </i>The Russians and Chinese were given
twenty-four hours to get out of Fernando Poo or the skies over Santa Isobel
would begin raining nuclear missiles: &quot;This is <i>darn </i>serious,&quot;
the Chief Executive said, &quot;and America will not shirk its responsibility to
the freedom-loving people of Fernando Poo!&quot; The broadcast concluded at 11
P.M. EST, and within two minutes people attempting to get reservations on
trains, planes, busses or car pools to Canada had virtually every telephone wire
in the country overloaded.</p>
<p>In Moscow, where it was ten the next morning, the Premier called a conference
and said crisply, &quot;That character in Washington is a mental lunatic, and he
means it. Get our men out of Fernando Poo right away, then find out who
authorized sending them in there in the first place and transfer him to be
supervisor of a hydroelectric works in Outer Mongolia.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have any men in Fernando Poo,&quot; a commissar said
mournfully. 'The Americans are imagining things again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, how the hell can we withdraw men if we don't have them there in
the first place?&quot; the Premier demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know. We've got twenty-four hours to figure that out, or-&quot;
the commissar quoted an old Russian proverb which means, roughly, that when the
polar bear excrement interferes with the fan belts, the machinery overheats.</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose we just announce that our troops are coming out?&quot; another
commissar suggested. &quot;They can't say we're lying <i>if </i>they don't find
any of our troops there afterward.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, they never believe anything we <i>say. </i>They want to be
shown,&quot; the premier said thoughtfully. &quot;We'll have to infiltrate some
troops surreptitiously and then withdraw them with a lot of fanfare and
publicity. That should do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid it won't end the problem,&quot; another pommissar said
funereally. &quot;Our intelligence indicates that there are Chinese troops
there. Unless Peking backs down, we're going to be caught in the middle when the
bombs start flying and-&quot; he quoted a proverb about the man in the
intersection when two manure trucks collide.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn,&quot; the Premier said. &quot;What the blue blazes do the Chinese
want with Fernando Poo?&quot;</p>
<p>He was harassed, but still he spoke with authority. He was,, in fact,
characteristic of the best type of dominant male in the world at this time. He
was fifty-five years old, tough, shrewd, unburdened by the complicated ethical
ambiguities which puzzle intellectuals, and had long ago decided that the world
was a mean son-of-a-bitch in which only the most cunning and ruthless can
survive. He was also as kind as was possible for one holding that
ultra-Darwinian philosophy; and he genuinely loved children and dogs, unless
they were on the site of something that had to be bombed in the National
Interest. He still retained some sense of humor, despite the burdens of his
almost godly office, and although he had been impotent with his wife for nearly
ten years now, he generally achieved orgasm in the mouth of a skilled prostitute
within 1.5 minutes. He took amphetamine pep pills to keep going on his grueling
twenty-hour day, with the result that his vision of the world was somewhat
skewed in a paranoid direction, and he took tranquilizers to keep from worrying
too much, with the result that his detachment sometimes bordered on
schizophrenia; but most of the time his innate shrewdness gave him a fingernail
grip on reality. In short, he was much like the rulers of America and China.</p>

banishing Thomas Edison and his light bulbs from mind, Saul Goodman looks back
over the first eight memos briefly, using the conservative and logical side of
his personality, rigidly holding back the intuitive functions. It was a habitual
exercise with him, and he called it expansion-and-contraction: leaping in the
dark for the </span>connection that must exist between fact one and fact two,
then going back slowly to check on himself.</p>
<p>The names and phrases flow past, in review: Fra
Dol-cino-1508-Roshinaya-Hassan i Sabbah-1090-Weis-haupt-assassinations-John
Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King-Mayor Daley-Cecil Rhodes-1888 -George
Washington....</p>
<p>Choices: (1) it is all true, exactly as the memos suggest; (2) it is partly
true, and partly false; (3) it is all false, and there is no secret society that
has endured from 1090 A.D. to the present.</p>
<p>Well, it isn't all true. Mayor Daley never said <i>&quot;Ewige Blumenkraft&quot;
</i>to Senator Ribicoff. Saul had read, in the <i>Washington Post, </i>a
lip-reader's translation of Daley's diatribe and there was no German in it,
although there was obscenity and anti-Semitism. The Weishaupt-Washington
impersonation theory also had some flaws-in those days, before plastic surgery,
such an undetected assumption of the identity of a well-known figure was
especially hard to credit, despite the circumstantial evidence quoted in the
memos-two strong arguments against choice one. The memos are not <i>all </i>true.</p>
<p>How about choice three? The Illuminati might not be a straight unbroken line
from the first recruit gathered by old Hassan i Sabbah to the person who bombed <i>Confrontation-</i>it
might have died and lain dormant for a term, like the Ku Klux Klan between 1872
and 1915; and it might have gone through such breakups and resurrections more
than once in eight centuries-but linkages of some sort, however tenuous, reached
from the eleventh century to the twentieth, from the Near East to Europe and
from Europe to America. Saul's dissatisfaction with official explanations of
recent assassinations, the impossibility of making any rational sense out of
current American foreign policy, and the fact that even historians who
vehemently distrusted all &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; acknowledged the
pivotal role of secret Masonic lodges in the French Revolution: all these added
weight to the rejection of choice 3. Besides, the Masons were the first group,
according to at least two of the memos, infiltrated by Weishaupt.</p>
<p>Choice 1 is definitely out, then, and choice 3 almost certainly equally
invalid; choice 2, therefore, is most probably correct. The theory in the memos
is partly true and partly false. But what, in essence, is the theory-and which
part of it is true, which part false?</p>
<p>Saul lit his pipe, closed his eyes, and concentrated.</p>
<p>The theory, in essence, was that the Illuminati recruited people through
various &quot;fronts,&quot; turned them on to some sort of <i>illuminizing </i>experience
through marijuana (or some special extract of marijuana) and converted them into
fanatics willing to use any means necessary to &quot;illuminize&quot; the rest
of the world. Their aim, obviously, is nothing less than the total
transformation of humanity itself, along the lines suggested by the film 2007,
or by Nietzsche's concept of the Superman. In the course of this conspiracy the
Illuminati, according to Malik's hints to Jackson, were systematically
assassinating every popular political figure who might interfere with their
program.</p>
<p>Saul thought, suddenly, of Charlie Manson, and of the glorification of Manson
by the Weatherman and Morituri bombers. He thought of the popularity of pot
smoking and of the slogan &quot;by any means necessary&quot; with contemporary
radical youth, even outside Weatherman. And he thought of Neitzsche's slogans,
&quot;Be hard. . . . Whatever is done for love is beyond good and evil. . . .
Above the ape is man, and above man, the Superman. . . . Forget not thy whip.
...&quot; In spite of his own logic, which had proved that Malik's theory was
only <i>partly </i>true, Saul Goodman, a lifelong liberal, suddenly felt a pang
of typically right-wing terror toward modern youth.</p>
<p>He reminded himself that Malik seemed to think the conspiracy emanated
chiefly from Mad Dog-and that was God's Lightning country down there. God's
Lightning had no fondness for marijuana, or for youth, or for the definitely
anti-Christian overtones of the Illuminati philosophy.</p>
<p>Besides, Malik's sources were only partly trustworthy.</p>
<p>And there were other possibilities: the Shriners, for instance, were part of
the Masonic movement, were generally right-wing, had their own hidden rites and
secrets, and used Arabic trappings that might well derive from Hassan i Sabbah
or the Roshinaya of Afghanistan. Who could say what secret plots were hatched at
Shriner conventions?</p>
<p>No, that was the intuitive pole vaulter in the right lobe at work again; and
right now Saul was concerned with the plodding logician in the left lobe.</p>
<p>The key to the mystery was in getting a clearer definition of the purpose of
the llluminati. Identify the change they were trying to accomplish-in man and in
his society-and then you would be able to guess, at least approximately, who
they were.</p>
<p>Their aim was English domination of the world, and they were Rhodes
Scholars-according to the Birchers. <i>That </i>idea, obviously, belonged with
Saul's own whimsey about a worldwide Shriner conspiracy. What then? The Italian
llluminati, under Fra Dolcino, wanted to redistribute the wealth-but the
International Bankers, mentioned in the <i>Playboy </i>letter, presumably wanted
to hold onto their wealth. Weishaupt was a &quot;freethinker&quot; according to
the <i>Britannica, </i>and so were Washington and Jefferson- but Sabbah and
Joachim of Florence were evidently heretical mystics of the Islamic and Catholic
traditions respectively.</p>
<p>Saul picked up the ninth memo, deciding to get more facts (or pretended
facts) before analyzing further-and then it hit him.</p>
<p>Whatever the Illuminati were aiming at had not been accomplished. Proof: If
it had, they would not still be conspiring in secret.</p>
<p>Since almost everything has been tried in the course of human history, find
out what hasn't been tried (at least not on a large scale)-and that will be the
condition to which the Illuminati are trying to move the rest of mankind.</p>
<p>Capitalism had been tried. Communism has been tried. Even Henry George's
Single Tax has been tried, in Australia. Fascism, feudalism and mysticism have
been tried. <i>Anarchism has never been tried.</i></p>
<p>Anarchism was frequently associated with assassinations. It had an appeal for
freethinkers, such as Kropotkin and Bakunin, but also for religious idealists,
like Tolstoy and Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement. Most anarchists
hoped, Joachim-like, to redistribute the wealth, but Rebecca had once told him
about a classic of anarchist literature, Max Stirner's <i>The Ego and His Own, </i>which
had been called &quot;the Billionaire's Bible&quot; because it stressed the
advantages the rugged individualist would gain in a stateless society-and Cecil
Rhodes was an adventurer before he was a banker. The Illuminati were anarchists.</p>
<p>It all fit: the pieces of the puzzle slipped together smoothly.</p>
<p>Saul was convinced. He was also wrong.</p>
<p><i>&quot;We'll just get our troops out of Fernando Poo,&quot; the Chairman of
the Chinese Communist party said on April 1. &quot;A place that size isn't worth
world war.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;But we don't have any troops there,&quot; an aide told him, &quot;it's
the Russians who do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; the Chairman quoted a proverb to the effect that there was
urine in the rosewater. &quot;I wonder what the hell the Russians want with
Fernando Poo?&quot; he added thoughtfully.</p>
<p>He was harassed, but still he spoke with authority. He was, in fact,
characteristic of the best type of dominant male in the world at this time. He
was fifty-five years old, tough, shrewd, unburdened by the complicated ethical

<p>(&quot;And it's not only a sin against God,&quot; Mr. Mocenigo shouts,
&quot;but it gives you germs, too.&quot; It is 1950, early spring on Mulberry
Street, and young Charlie Mocenigo raises terrified eyes. &quot;Look,
look,&quot; Mr. Mocenigo goes on angrily, &quot;don't believe your own father.
See what the dictionary says. Look, look at the page. Here, see. 'Masturbation:
self-pollution.' Do you know what self-pollution means? Do you know how long
those germs last?&quot; And in another spring, 1955, Charles Mocenigo, a pale,
skinny, introverted genius, registers for his first semester at MIT and, coming
to the square on the form that says &quot;Religion,&quot; writes in careful
block capitals, ATHEIST. He has read Kinsey and Hirschfeld and almost all the
biologically oriented sexological treatises by this time-studiously ignoring
psychoanalysts and such unscientific types-and the only visible remnant of that
early adolescent terror is a habit of washing his hands frequently when under
tension, which earns him the nickname &quot;Soapy.&quot;)</p>
<p><i>General Talbot looks at Mocenigo pityingly and raises his pistol to the

<p>On August 6, 1902, the world produced its usual crop of new humans, all
programmed to act more or less 'alike, all containing minor variations of the
same basic DNA blueprint; of these, approximately 51,000 were female and 50,000
were male; and two of the males, born at the same second, were to play a large
role in our story, and to pursue somewhat similar and anabatic careers. The
first, born over a cheap livery stable in the Bronx, New York, was named Arthur
Flegenheimer and, at the other end of his life, spoke very movingly about his
mother (as well as about bears and sidewalks and French Canadian Bean</p>
<p>Soup); the second, born in one of the finest old homes on Beacon Hill in
Boston, was named Robert Putney Drake and, at the other end of his life, thought
rather harshly of his mother . . . but when the paths of Mr. Flegenheimer and
Mr. Drake crossed, in 1935, one of the links was formed which led to the
Fernando Poo Incident.</p>
<p>And, in present time, more or less, 00005 was summoned to meet W. in the
headquarters of a certain branch of British Intelligence. The date was March 17,
but being English, neither 00005 nor W. gave a thought to blessed Saint Patrick;
instead, they spoke of Fernando Poo.</p>
<p>&quot;The Yanks,&quot; W. said crisply, &quot;are developing evidence that
the Russians or the Chinese, or both of them, are behind this Tequilla y Moto
swine. Of course, even if that were true, it wouldn't matter a damn to Her
Majesty's government; what do we care if a <i>speck </i>of an island that size
turns Red? But you know the Yanks, 00005-they're ready to go to war over it,
although they haven't announced that publicly yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mission,&quot; 00005 asked, the fault lines of cruelty about his
mouth turning into a most engaging smile, &quot;is to hop down to Fernando Poo
and find out the real politics of this Tequilla y Mota bloke and if he is Red
overthrow him before the Yanks blow up the world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's the assignment. We can't have a bloody nuclear war just when the
balance of payments is almost straightened out and the Common Market is finally
starting to work. So, hop to it, straightaway. Naturally, if you're captured,
Her Majesty's government will have to disavow any knowledge of your
actions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It always seems to work out that way,&quot; 00005 said ironically.
&quot;I wish for once you'd give me a mission where Her Majesty's bleeding
government would stand behind me in a tight spot.&quot;</p>
<p>But 00005, of course, was merely being witty; as a loyal subject, he would
follow orders under any circumstances, even if it required the death of every
soul on Fernando Poo and himself as well. He rose, in his characteristic
debonair fashion, and headed for his own office, where he began his preparations
for the Fernando Poo mission. His first step was to check his personal worldwide
travel notebook, seeking the bar in Santa Isobel which came closest to serving a
suitable martini and the restaurant most likely to prepare an endurable lobster
Newburg. To his horror, there was no such bar and no such restaurant. Santa
Isobel was bereft of social graces.</p>
<p>&quot;I say,&quot; 00005 muttered, &quot;this is going to be a bit <i>thick.&quot;</i></p>
<p>But he cheered up quickly, for he knew that Fernando Poo would be equipped at
least with a bevy of tawny-skinned or coffee-colored females, and such women
were the Holy Grail to him. Besides, he had already formed his own theory about
Fernando Poo: he was convinced that BUGGER-Blowhard's Unreformed Gangsters,
Goons, and Espionage Renegades, an international conspiracy of criminals and
double agents, led by the infamous and mysterious Eric &quot;the Red&quot;
Blowhard-was behind it all. 00005 had never heard of the Illuminati.</p>
<p>In fact, 00005, despite his dark hair combed straight back, his piercing
eyes, his cruel and handsome face, his trim athlete's body, and his capacity to
penetrate any number of females and defenestrate any number of males in the
course of duty, was not really an ideal intelligence agent. He had grown up
reading Ian Fleming novels and one day, at the age of twenty-one, looked in the
mirror, decided he was everything a Fleming hero should be, and started a
campaign to get into the spy game. After fourteen years in bureaucratic
burrowing, he finally arrived in one of the intelligence services, but it was
much more the kind of squalid and bumbling organization in which Harry Palmer
had toiled his cynical days away than it was a berth of Bondage. Nevertheless,
00005 did his best to refurbish and glamorize the scene and, perhaps because God
looks after fools, he hadn't managed to get himself killed in any of the
increasingly bizarre missions to which he was assigned. The missions were all
weird, at first, because nobody took them seriously-they were all based on wild
rumors that had to be checked out just in case there be some truth in them-but
later it was realized that 00005's peculiar schizophrenia was well suited to
certain real problems, just as the schizoid of the more withdrawn type is ideal
for a &quot;sleeper&quot; agent since he could easily forget what was
conventionally considered his real self. Of course, nobody at any time ever took
BUGGER seriously, and, behind his back, 00005's obsession with this organization
was a subject of much interdepartmental humor.</p>

<p><i>&quot;All those hallucinations. I thought I might be losing my mind.&quot;</i></p>

think, even now, that it was just hallucinations?&quot; he asked.</i></p>
