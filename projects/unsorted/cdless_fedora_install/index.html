    <h1>Installing Fedora Core 3 without CDs</h1>

    <p>I have a lab where I would like to install <a
    href="http://fedora.redhat.com">Fedora Core 3</a>. Unfortunately,
    my only resources are that desire, a laptop running <a
    href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat 9</a> and a friend who has the
    FC3 CDs, but can't let me have them for an extended period. No
    blank CDs or a CD burner, though I do have a bootable <a
    href="http://www.sysresccd.org">system rescue CD</a> that I use to
    ghost with <a href="http://www.partimage.org">partimage</a>. I
    live in the <a href="http://www.mauritania.mr">desert</a>, so all
    the floppy drives are buggered even if I did have any
    floppies.</p>

    <p>So, this is the process I used to copy the CDs and then install
    without having the CDs and bootstrapping without using any of
    RedHat's media.</p>

    <h2>Image CDs</h2>

    <p>So I started by heading over to my friend's office. I wanted to
    retain the possibility of creating CDs in the future, so I didn't
    want to mount them and copy the data off. Doing so would lose the
    <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Torito_(CD-ROM_standard)">el
    torito</a> boot image and if I remade the ISO9660 (<a
    href="http://www.ecma.ch/stand/ecma-119.htm">ECMA 119</a>)
    filesystem it wouldn't be bootable.</p>

    <p>Because the CDs are a single data track, I don't have to be
    especially careful in copying them. This is good because normally
    I would use <code>readcd</code> which will correctly handle
    multisession CDs, but I discovered I don't have
    <code>readcd</code> on my laptop. Fortunately, for a simple copy
    like this, I could use the more basic method of:</p>

<pre># dd if=/dev/cdrom of=FC3-i386-disc<em>I</em>.iso</pre>

    <p>This almost worked. There was something funky in how my friend
    had burned the CDs and instead of terminating normally, I got some
    read errors and the process died. I ran the <code>md5sum</code>s
    and they weren't right, but then I noticed that the files were all
    too big. So I ran:</p>

<pre># dd if=FC3-i386-disc1.iso of=FC3-i386-disc1.new.iso bs=1K count=631824</pre>

    <p>I got the file sizes off of one of the FTP sites. The truncated
    files then summed correctly.</p>

    <h2>Creating the Repository</h2>

    <p>The basic idea is to do a HTTP install. To do this, I need the
    files out of the iso images. A simple way would be to mount them
    on the loopback and copy their contents out. The disadvantage to
    this is that it will double to storage space required, so instead
    I decided to do a bunch of symlinks. I wrote a little <a
    href="setup_os.sh">shell script</a> to handle setting the stuff
    up:</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash

DESTDIR=os
ISOPATTERN=FC3-i386-disc\$i.iso

PROGPATH="${0%/*}"
pushd "$PROGPATH" > /dev/null
WORKDIR="$(pwd)"
[ -d "$DESTDIR" ] || mkdir -vp "$DESTDIR"
for i in $(seq 1 4); do
    ISO=$(eval echo "$ISOPATTERN")
    DIR="disc-$i"
    [ -e "$ISO" ] || (echo "Missing ISO: $ISO" &amp;&amp; exit 1)
    [ -d "$DIR" ] || mkdir -vp "$DIR"
    mount | grep "$WORKDIR/$ISO on $WORKDIR/$DIR" > /dev/null || sudo mount -o loop "$ISO" "$DIR" || exit 1
    for dir in $(find "$DIR" -type d); do
        [ "$dir" == "$DIR" ] &amp;&amp; continue
        NEWDIR="$DESTDIR/${dir#$DIR/}"
        [ -d "$NEWDIR" ] || mkdir -vp "$NEWDIR"
    done
    for file in $(find "$DIR" -type f); do
        PROGPATH="${file%/*}"
        RELPATH=$(echo $PROGPATH | sed -e "s/[^/]\+/../g")
        NEWFILE="$DESTDIR/${file#$DIR/}"
        [ -e "$NEWFILE" ] || ln -sv "$RELPATH/$file" "$NEWFILE"
    done
    echo "Mounted and symlinked: $ISO"
done
popd > /dev/null</pre>

    <p>This mounts the iso images matching <code>ISOPATTERN</code> on
    the loopback and creates a directory structure under
    <code>DESTDIR</code> which has symlinks back to all the files. It
    preserves the iso images, but allows up to access the contents as
    though they were a unified repository.</p>

    <h2>Bootstrapping the Installer</h2>

    <p>Now comes a slightly trickier part. How to actually do the
    install. The systems currently have an XP install that I want to
    leave intact. As I mentioned before I don't have any of RedHat's
    media to boot from, so I need some method for loading the install
    program using either XP or my <a
    href="http://www.sysresccd.org">system rescue CD</a>. This process
    is not to difficult (and I strongly suspect there is an easier
    method than I used).</p>

    <p>After booting I from the CD, I created the partition I am going
    to want to install to. This is, of course, specific to my system
    and entering these commands directly could hose your hard drive, so
    <b>don't</b>. The <em>italicized</em> bits are things specific to
    my configuration, so be sure to change them before using them.</p>

<pre># fdisk <em>/dev/hda</em> &lt;&lt; EOF

initrd /boot/initrd.img
EOF
# grub &lt;&lt; EOF
root <em>(hd0,1)</em>
setup <em>(hd0)</em>
quit
EOF
# reboot</pre>

    <h2>Installing</h2>

    <p>After rebooting I pull out the CD and it starts with the fedora
    install. I did an install, choose the HTTP install and used
    <code>http://<em>192.168.99.250/isos/fc3-heidelberg</em>/os/</code>
    as my source.</p>

    <p>That's it. The install ran without any problems. If you try
    this and have any problems, <a href="mailto:will@himinbi.org">let
    me know</a>.</p>

    <h2>Security Enhanched Linux</h2>

    <p>On systems running SELinux, you may have problems serving the files from the ISOs mounted on the loopback. One simple fix if your system is local is just to turn off SELinux for a bit with the <code>setenforce 0</code> command.</p>
