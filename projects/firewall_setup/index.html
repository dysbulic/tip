    <h1>Fedora Core 3 Firewall Setup</h1>
    <h2>June 2005</h2>

    <p>My project du jour is getting updating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall#Firewalls_in_computer_networking">firewall</a> for the lab from <a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat 8</a> to <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com">Fedora Core 3</a>. We are doing a <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> install for the lab so we can have a training toward the end of the month.</p>

    <p>The firewall will actually be serving several important functions for the lab:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#nat">NAT</a></li>
      <li><a href="#dns">DNS Server</a></li>
      <li><a href="#dhcp">DHCP Server</a></li>
      <li><a href="#ldap">LDAP Server</a></li>
      <li><a href="#smb">Domain Controller</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Install</h1>

    <p>Actually installing the system was something of a challenge.
    I've got the ISO images, but no blank CDs. I used a <a
    href="../cdless_fedora_install/">funky HTTP install</a> for the
    machines in the lab, but the firewall only has 32mb of RAM and the
    FC3 installer refuses to run. So, I had to actually pull the drive
    and run the install in another box and then move it back.
    Disappointingly, the support for the ISA network cards which were
    auto-detected in RedHat 8, did not work in FC3. I had to go in and
    edit <code>/etc/modprobe.conf</code> by hand.</p>
      
    <p>After some mucking about thought I managed to get it up and
    running. It was not horrible, but the number of problems I had
    definitely would have thwarted almost any novice:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I had to move the drive once because the installer wouldn't
      run</li>
      <li>I had to move it back again because the first startup runs a
      graphical setup program that wasn't starting correctly. (And
      worse, was failing silently, so all I knew was that it wasn't
      starting.)</li>
      <li>Then I had to configure the ISA network cards by hand.</li>
    </ol>
      
    <p>Finally though it was up and running with all the hardware
    working.</p>
      
    <a name="nat"></a>
    <h1>NAT</h1>
      
    <p>My little lab is <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat">NAT</a>ed away from the
    rest of the university. We didn't used to be this way, but
    students here are frequently changing the IP addresses as a part
    of <a href="http://www.cisco-academy.mr">the course</a> and though
    I emphasized the importance of being careful, they weren't. The
    university admins got frustrated with it and eventually stuck us
    off on our own. I prefer this solution to the previous one, which
    was simply to unplug our lab from the main switch.</p>
      
    <p>The NAT was quick and simple: (we are
    <code>192.169.99.0/24</code> and the uni is
    <code>192.168.2.0/24</code>)</p>

    <pre><em>iptables</em> -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.99.0/255.255.255.0 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.2.176
<em>service</em> iptables save</pre>

    <p>There is also a server for the <a
    href="http://cisco.netacad.net">Cisco curriculum</a> and a <a
    href="http://www.samba.org">SMB fileserver</a> at
    <code>192.168.99.250</code>. I wanted that traffic to pass
    through, so I also did:</p>

    <pre><em>iptables</em> -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.2.176 -p tcp -j DNAT \
    --dport 80 --to-destination 192.168.99.250
<em>iptables</em> -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.2.176 -p tcp -j DNAT \
    --dport 138:139 --to-destination 192.168.99.250
<em>iptables</em> -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.2.176 -p udp -j DNAT \
    --dport 138:139 --to-destination 192.168.99.250
<em>service</em> iptables save</pre>

    <a name="dns"></a>
    <h1>DNS Server</h1>

    <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dns">DNS</a> servers
    provided <a href="http://www.mauritel.mr">Mauritel</a> are fairly
    unreliable. For this reason and to provide <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS">dynamic DNS</a> in
    conjunction with the <a href="#dhcp">DHCP</a>, I wanted to run a
    <a href="http://www.bind9.net">DNS</a> server.</p>

    <p>The setup is simple enough. I added a couple zones (<a
    href="../config/firewall/cisco.zone">forward</a> and <a
    href="../config/firewall/192.168.99.reverse">reverse</a>) to the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot_jail">chroot jail</a>
    at <code>/var/named/chroot/var/named/</code> for the local
    addresses in the lab and then added the shared dyndns stuff to
    <code>/etc/<a
    href="../config/firewall/named.conf">named.conf</a></code>.</p>

    <p>This was the first place I hit a snag. Something new in FC3 was
    the <a
    href="http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/selinux-faq/">integration</a>
    of Security Enhanched Linux (<a
    href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/">SELinux</a>). I've never used
    it before and it was denying access to the new zones that I'd
    created.</p>

    <p>The problem with traditional Linux security is granularity.
    There are normal users and there is root and the layering of
    protections between them is pretty slim. For instance, to run a
    program like <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>, I have
    to be able to bind port 80. To do so, the process has to be
    running as root. Another term for root is the "superuser" and
    while running as root I embody that term in a Nietzscheian <a
    href="http://www.stanford.edu/~pj97/Nietzsche.htm">übermensch</a>
    kind of way. I can look at or delete anyone's files I want to. I
    can send out forged emails or <a
    href="http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/">sniff</a> network
    traffic. I am above the law and only bounded by my capabilities
    and imagination.</p>
      
    <p>The process that is normally used is to mediate this problem is
    that the Apache process will essentally give up its Godhood and
    become a normal user after it has done whatever it needed to do.
    This process though has its problems, mostly inherent in having to
    trust Apache. A better solution would be to be able change the
    environment so that Apache was only given limited power in the
    first place so even if it is made to misbehave, it can't do any
    harm. This is what SELinux begins to provide.</p>

    <p>All subjects (users, programs or processes) and objects (files
    and devices) are now assigned identities, roles and types. There
    are security policies which are made based on those
    attributes.</p>

    <p>The error I am getting when I try and start named is:</p>

    <pre>audit(911588074.103:0): avc:  denied  { read } for  pid=15535
   exe=/usr/sbin/named name=named.conf dev=dm-0 ino=267969
   scontext=root:system_r:named_t tcontext=root:object_r:user_home_t tclass=file</pre>

    <p>If I just look at the file permissions, everything seems fine:</p>

    <pre><em>ls</em> -l named.conf*
-rw-r--r--  1 root named 1547 déc 12  2004 named.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  1329 nov 20 02:10 named.conf.orig</pre>

    <p>The file is readable by the <code>named</code> user who is what
    the bind process is running as. When we look at the SELinux
    contexts though, we can see the problem. (The programs
    <code>ls</code>, <code>ps</code> and <code>id</code> all now take
    a <code>Z</code> parameter than shows SELinux contexts.)</p>

    <pre><em>ls</em> -lZ named.conf*
-rw-r--r--  root named  root:object_r:user_home_t    named.conf
-rw-r--r--  root root   root:object_r:named_conf_t   named.conf.orig</pre>

    <p>The file
    <code>/etc/selinux/targeted/src/policy/domains/program/named.te</code>
    contains the directive: (I had to install the
    <code>selinux-policy-targeted-sources</code> package to have the
    source.)</p>

    <pre>r_dir_file(named_t, named_conf_t)</pre>

    <p>This means that subjects of type <code>named_t</code> should be
    given read access to objects of type <code>named_conf_t</code>.
    Previously in the file there was the line:</p>

    <pre>can_exec(named_t, named_exec_t)</pre>
      
    <p>Which means that subjects of type <code>named_t</code> can
    execute objects of type <code>named_exec_t</code>.
    (<code>/usr/sbin/named</code> is of type
    <code>named_exec_t</code>.)</p>

    <p>So, to fix my problem, I have to fix the context. The way to
    that is:</p>

    <pre><em>restorecon</em> -v /var/named/chroot/etc/named.conf</pre>

    <p>The same problem exists for the new zone files, so I also have
    to do:</p>

    <pre><em>restorecon</em> -v /var/named/chroot/var/named/*</pre>

    <a name="dhcp"></a>
    <h1>DHCP Server</h1>

    <p>In an attempt to reduce the number of problems that we are
    having with misconfigured machines, I set up a <a
    href="http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/dhcp/">DHCP</a> server. The
    setup is pretty straight forward. I got the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">mac address</a>
    off of each machine set up some blocks:</p>
      
    <ul>
      <li>Recognized Machines: <code>192.168.99.0/26</code>
      (<code>192.168.99.0</code> - <code>192.168.99.63</code>)</li>
      <li>Unrecognized Machines: <code>192.168.99.64/26</code>
      (<code>192.168.99.64</code> - <code>192.168.99.127</code>)</li>
      <li>
        Servers: <code>192.168.99.192/26</code>
        (<code>192.168.99.192</code> - <code>192.168.99.254</code>)
        <ul>
          <li>Firewall: <code>192.168.99.254</code></li>
          <li>Fileserver: <code>192.168.99.250</code></li>
          <li>My Laptop: <code>192.168.99.251</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The basic file came from
    <code>/usr/share/doc/dhcp-3.0.1/dhcpd.conf.sample</code> and I
    edited it and put it at <code>/etc/<a
    href="../config/firewall/dhcpd.conf">dhcpd.conf</a></code>.</p>

    <p>There is a SELinux problem here as well. There is a ownership
    problem like with named, but additionally, for the dnydns there is
    a shared file, <code>/etc/rndc.key</code>, with the authentication
    key used to update the server.</p>
      
    <p>When I initially tried to run the program, I got an access
    denied error and in the logs it said:</p>

    <pre>audit(911596073.741:0): avc:  denied  { search } for pid=16624
   exe=/usr/sbin/dhcpd name=named dev=dm-0 ino=426311
   scontext=root:system_r:dhcpd_t tcontext=system_u:object_r:named_zone_t tclass=dir</pre>

    <p><code>/etc/rndc.key</code> is just a symlink to
    <code>/var/named/chroot/etc/rndc.key</code>. The directory is of
    type <code>named_conf_t</code> which by the default policy dhcpd
    can't access. There is probably a more graceful way to deal with
    this problem, but all I did was to grant it premission to the
    whole context: (as well as giving permission to read
    <code>rndc.key</code> of the same type)</p>

    <pre><em>cat</em> >> /etc/selinux/targeted/src/policy/domains/program/dhcpd.te &lt;&lt; EOF

# Added to allow shared key config with bind:
allow dhcpd_t named_conf_t:dir { search };
allow dhcpd_t named_zone_t:dir { search };
allow dhcpd_t named_conf_t:file { read getattr };
EOF
<em>make</em> -C /etc/selinux/targeted/src/policy/ load</pre>

    <a name="ldap"></a>
    <h1>LDAP Server</h1>

    <p>I've done the <a href="#dns">DNS</a> and <a
    href="#dhcp">DHCP</a> servers before. I've even done a <a
    href="#smb">domain controller</a> and some <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/">LDAP programming</a>.
    I've never had a Linux lab to run before, so this was my first
    time setting up a shared authentication source for Linux boxen.
    The majority of the information on <a
    href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDAP-Implementation-HOWTO/">the
    setup</a> came from the <a href="http://www.tldp.org">Linux
    Documention Project</a>.</p>

    <p>The first issue was to get the server up and running. This took
    an edit of <code>/etc/openldap/<a
    href="../config/firewall/slapd.conf">slapd.conf</a></code> to set
    the <code>suffix</code>, <code>rootdn</code> and
    <code>rootpw</code>. Also I tighetened the default security policy
    which is nonexistent and enabled <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>.</p>

    <p>The default security policy gives everyone read access to
    everything, which is something of a problem. It also restricts
    write access only to the server administrator which means no users
    can change their passwords. So the security changes in <code><a
    href="../config/firewall/slapd.conf">slapd.conf</a></code> have to
    be put into place before the setup will work.</p>

    <p>Also, the migration will put the entries into an organizational
    unit, <code>People</code> under the base dn and groups under
    <code>Group</code>. Once the server is started you have to create
    those <a href="../config/firewall/base.ldif">base entries</a>. If
    necessary, you can clear the directory first using
    <code>ldapdelete</code> or just removing all the data files in
    <code>/var/lib/ldap/</code>.</p>

    <pre><em>service</em> ldap stop
<em>rm</em> -rfv /var/lib/ldap/*
<em>service</em> ldap start
admin=$(grep -e ^rootdn /etc/openldap/slapd.conf | \
        sed -e "s/^rootdn[[:space:]]\+\"\([^\"]\+\)\"/\\1/")
<em>ldapadd</em> -H ldaps://localhost -D "$admin" -xW -f base.ldif</pre>

    <p>To migrate the existing information over to LDAP uses some <a
    href="http://www.perlmonks.org">perl</a> scripts incuded in the
    distribution. Some setup is required by setting the environment
    variable <code>LDAP_BASEDN</code> before running:</p>

    <pre>export LDAP_BASEDN="o=Académie Cisco,o=Université de Nouakchott,c=MR"
<em>/usr/share/openldap/migration/migrate_passwd.pl</em> /etc/passwd > passwd.ldif
<em>ldapadd</em> -H ldap://localhost -D "$admin" -xW -f passwd.ldif
<em>/usr/share/openldap/migration/migrate_group.pl</em> /etc/group > group.ldif
<em>ldapadd</em> -H ldap://localhost -D "$admin" -xW -f group.ldif</pre>

    <p>This firewall will not actually be authenticating against the
    LDAP server, so the other changes are to the clients. I needed to
    update the configuration of the name service switch at
    <code>/etc/<a
    href="../config/firewall/nsswitch.conf">nsswitch.conf</a></code>,
    the <a href="">PAM</a> config at <code>/etc/pam.d/<a
    href="../config/firewall/system-auth">system-auth</a></code> and
    the default LDAP config at <code>/etc/<a
    href="../config/firewall/ldap.conf">ldap.conf</a></code>.
    (<code><a
    href="../config/firewall/system-auth">system-auth</a></code> and
    <code><a href="../config/firewall/ldap.conf">ldap.conf</a></code>
    were primarily updated by <code>authconfig</code>.) Also, to unify
    things a bit, I removed <code>/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</code> and
    made that a symlink to <code>/etc/<a
    href="../config/firewall/ldap.conf">ldap.conf</a></code>. Nsswitch
    uses the file in <code>etc</code> and <code>ldapsearch</code> uses
    the one in <code>openldap</code>, but the format is the same.</p>

    <p>The one important thing to note with using the same file for
    both <code>/etc/<a
    href="../config/firewall/ldap.conf">ldap.conf</a></code> and
    <code>/etc/openldap/<a
    href="../config/firewall/ldap.conf">ldap.conf</a></code> is that
    PAM does not respect the <code>uri</code> directive, and so if you
    used that it is also necessary to include a <code>host</code>
    entry.</p>

    <p>The debugging of this step proved a little troublesome, some
    commands that I found useful:</p>

    <p>To verify that the ldap server was running and that I could
    connect from the client:</p>

    <pre>ldapsearch -x -H ldaps://firewall "(uid=will)"</pre>

    <p>On the server, in order to know which connections were being
    made and how, I did:</p>

    <pre>slapd -u ldap -d 1 -h "ldap:/// ldaps:///"</pre>

    <p>The debug levels is a bitmask (so you add the values to combine
    them):</p>

    <div style="text-align: center">
      <table>
        <tr><th>Level</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
        <tr><td>-1</td><td>enable all debugging</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0</td><td>no debugging</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>trace function calls</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>debug packet handling</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>heavy trace debugging</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8</td><td>connection management</td></tr>
        <tr><td>16</td><td>print out packets sent and received</td></tr>
        <tr><td>32</td><td>search filter processing</td></tr>
        <tr><td>64</td><td>configuration file processing</td></tr>
        <tr><td>128</td><td>access control list processing</td></tr>
        <tr><td>256</td><td>stats log connections/operations/results</td></tr>
        <tr><td>512</td><td>stats log entries sent</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1024</td><td>print communication with shell backends</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2048</td><td>print entry parsing debugging</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    
    <p>In the end I turned on all debugging and found that my problem
    was I had used both a <code>ldaps://</code> uri and the <code>ssl
    start_tls</code> command in <code>/etc/<a
    href="../config/firewall/ldap.conf">ldap.conf</a></code>. It was
    trying to start TLS twice and was failing. After this was fixed I
    could do:</p>

    <pre>getent passwd</pre>

    <p>And it would return results both from <code>/etc/passwd</code>
    on the machine and from the LDAP server.</p>

    <p>Also the <code>passwd</code> command now works correctly to
    change passwords. The one potential issue is I can't change a
    user's password without knowing their old password. The system has
    to bind the LDAP server with an account with the permission to
    change the password and only the user and <code>rootdn</code> have
    that right. What I would like is to have it use the
    <code>rootdn</code> to bind when I'm running as root. I can have
    it do that, but only if I store the password in
    <code>/etc/ldap.secret</code> and I don't want to do that on all
    the workstations. I'll have to deal with this later.</p>

    <a name="smb"></a>
    <h1>Domain Controller</h1>
    
    <p>Though my lab is a salle of logiciel libre, the primary
    operating system currently installed is <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com">XP Pro</a> with French and Arabic
    <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/DrIntl/faqs/Muifaq.mspx">MUI</a>.
    A nice setup even if it does come from the <a
    href="http://www.ratrobot.com/writing/ms/">evil empire</a>.
    Hopefully with this new <a
    href="http://fedora.redhat.com">Fedora</a> setup I can get some
    people weaned.</p>

    <p>The machines all have really <a
    href="../lockdown/">restricted</a> local user accounts that only
    let the students read and run a few <a
    href="http://will.mr.pcvs.org/gmc_setup.html">basic programs</a>.
    For the other teachers and myself though I want for them to be
    able to log in with a <a
    href="http://groups.haas.berkeley.edu/HCS/howdoi/profiles/roamingpf.htm">roaming
    profiles</a>. Given that I hardly want to have to touch each
    computer to add accounts, I need a <a
    href="http://www.samba.org">domain controller</a>.</p>

    <p>It just took making a few changes to the default
    <code>/etc/samba/<a
    href="../config/firewall/smb.conf">smb.conf</a></code>.</p>

    <p>Before I could use the tools included for managing the LDAP
    server, I had to install a perl LDAP module:</p>

    <pre>perl -MCPAN -e 'install ldap'</pre>

    <p>Or, actually for the server I was setting up I was having a
    problem with the OOM killer kicking in and killing off both the
    CPAN update and my ssh session, so I had to do the install by
    hand:</p>

    

    <p>After the modules were installed, I updated the config file for
    the included <a href="http://www.idealx.org/prj/samba/">ldap
    tools</a> at /usr/share/doc/samba-3.0.8/LDAP/smbldap-tools/<a
    href="../config/firewall/smbldap_conf.pm">smbldap_conf.pm</a>.
    Then I ran the script to create all the needed base entries:</p>

    <pre>perl /usr/share/doc/samba-3.0.8/LDAP/smbldap-tools/smbldap-populate.pl</pre>

    <p>Then I added a couple NT accounts just to try out that it was
    working:</p>

    <pre>smbpasswd -a root</pre>

    <p>To see if I could connect then I did:</p>

    <pre>smbclient //localhost/root -U root</pre>

    <p>Now I wanted to take hosts and join them to the domain
    controller. Each machine has to be added to the database to join
    the domain. To do this automatically, the domain controller needs
    access to some scripts. Rather than putting the actual paths in
    the config file, I made some symbolic links:</p>

    <pre></pre>
    

    <pre><em>groupadd</em> smbdomain
<em>mkdir</em> -p /home/samba/netlogon</pre>

  </body>
</html>
