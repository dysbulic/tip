    <h1>Replicating xsltproc in Java</h1>
    
    <p>I have recently migrated to <a href="http://dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> and other than it being a little slow, I'm generally happy with it. One of the issues though is <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html">xsltproc</a> is not present on their servers. I have a couple pages that are generated via <acronym title="Extensible Stylesheets">XSLT</acronym> and I need some method of generating them.</p>

    <p>I've tried a couple times to use <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</a>. I really like the basic metaphor of the library, but decoupling it from a web publishing framework is still a problem. I've tried three times now and there's still not an easy method for usinf their pipelining framework from the command line. (Or adaptively initializing it from within code in general.) It's honestly a shame because the basic metaphor is very extensible and has many potential applications outside the realm of serving web content.</p>

    <p>Supposedly the upcoming reforctoring may help address this, but in the interim I have a very simple little SAX2's <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/org/xml/sax/XMLFilter.html">XMLFilter</a>-based program. It's a bit of a kludge because SAX2 has the ability to create XMLFilters from XSLT stylesheets, but there's no way to pass in parameter value. <a href="Transformations API for XML">TrAX</a> has a method for passing in parameter values, but the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?javax/xml/transform/sax/TransformerHandler.html">TransformerHandler</a> interface is more difficult to extend than XMLFilter.</p>
    <p>TRaX is push-based, operating on a chain of <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/xml/transform/Result.html">Result</a>s whereas XMLFilter chains together a series of <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/org/xml/sax/XMLReader.html">XMLReader</a>s that ultimately form a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/xml/transform/sax/SAXSource.html">SAXSource</a>. Joining the two is difficult in a compact manner and this particular code relies on the non-futureproof fact that the XMLFilter implementation for XSLT stylesheets is based on the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">Xalan project</a>'s <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/apidocs/org/apache/xalan/transformer/TrAXFilter.html">TrAXFilter</a> which provides access to the underlying <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?javax/xml/transform/Transformer.html">Transformer</a> for setting paramters.</p>

    <p>The program is <a href="src/org/himinbi/util/XSLTTransformer.java">org.himinbi.util.XSLTTransformer</a>. It takes an input, an arbitrary number of XSLTs and an output filename and chains them together. A compiled version should also be packaged up in <a href="../jars/XSLTTransformer.jar">XSLTTransformer.jar</a>.</p>
