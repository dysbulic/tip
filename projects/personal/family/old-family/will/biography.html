<p>I have never had occasion to write a formal autobiography before, nor have I ever had any particular luck with the grammatical nuances of the English language. Please be as lenient as possible in the judgement of any transgressions on either front. Then again, this is my story, as per request, and to write it in a formal style that is someone else's seems illogical. Thus, I will do it in my own unique way.</p>

<p>An autobiography is for me a very large undertaking. For some time I have held certain thoughts on the nature of human existence. I believe that we are born imbued with certain qualities which are given to us by a benevolent God. Which of those qualities are allowed to surface and how they are used is dependant on our life's experiences. Also, I think that our personalities are shaped in a large part by our environment, but how our experiences affect us is under our control, and that we all have the capacity to act correctly and make the right decisions; even if those choices aren't easy. Accordingly, an autobiography, whose primary purpose I take as allowing the reader with an opportunity for added familiarity with the author, for me should deal with the abstract feelings and thoughts that I had dealing with the experiences, as much as the actual experiences themselves. Since these experiences have shaped my expression of my "true self," this is not only the story of who I was, but is also about who I am and who I will become.</p>

<p>On November the seventeenth, in the year of our Lord nineteen-hundred and seventy-eight, I, William James Holcomb, entered the world as the first borne son of James Lyne "Jim" Holcomb and Sonja Lolita Holcomb. I can remember almost nothing of my early life. I have been told I was both adorable and mischievous. The only vague memories that I have seem to deal with disciplinary action. For instance, I remember an almost daily beating from an elderly woman who was my third grade teacher, and I was the only member of my sixth grade class to be corporally punished. The latter helped my story about an iron paddle that shocked an unfortunate student when the needles stuck out of it were imbedded into the flesh of his backside to proliferate for many years. I have always had a problem with people who I felt were patronizing me. I don't mind if someone is smarter than me or if someone knows some information that I don't, so long as I feel they respect me, but if I feel they are implying that their position gives them an intrinsic superiority. I will not accept it. I feel to stand idly by and watch a crime is nearly as bad as to commit it. When I was young this equated with a large amount of rebellion. For instance, in one of the few times that I decided to deal with an interpersonal conflict with physical interaction; I tackled another student in my sixth grade class, and we went plowing through three rows of desks. Our punishment for the altercation was to be banished to the back storeroom for the rest of the day, in the hope we would get bored and reconcile our differences. It failed, largely because of me, not because of my anger at my peer, but because of my absolute refusal to be forced into an action. My stubbornness caused us to spend an entire eight hour day seated in complete silence staring at the wall. With the slight maturity that the years have given me, I have become more tolerant of others attitudes. Realizing that they are simply suffering under some of the faults to which we are all prone, and if I forgive their's now, perhaps they will be as forgiving of mine later. On the whole, my early life was excellent, and any problems that arose came from within me and not from my surroundings. I was involved with all types of activities; from private school, to summer enrichment programs, to sports leagues, to church work, to community involvement. Both of my parents had been child and family psychologists at one time, and they did their best to prepare me for the world. Whatever the effect of nurture in the nature vs. nurture battle, I had one of the best upbringings possible.</p>

<p>If I were to separate my life into chapters, then the second chapter began literally overnight. I found my entire position in the social ladder and my concept of the world changed so abruptly that it is frightening to contemplate, and as is often the case a change for the worse came with much less investment than a change for the better.</p>

<p>The second section of my life was set into motion with one event. It was a Friday afternoon, and I was sitting in Summer Rayburn's seventh grade chorus class doing my math homework. Disney's "Robin Hood" was playing on the television and my friend Phillip Wright was seated beside me. Phillip had seen the movie before, I was concentrating on my homework, and he was understandably bored. I happened to drop my pencil and he picked it up, but he wouldn't give it back. He tried to keep it away from me; simply innocent, albeit immature, fun. Then, he stuck it in his pocket and I reached in to try to retrieve it. Not knowing that in doing so I was signing my death warrant. Looking back, this all seems like childish fun, but some would disagree.</p>

<p>I grew up in a strong conservative Christian home. There never was any discussion of homosexuality, and I'm not even sure I was aware of the existence of gay people. None the less, when I came back to school the next day I had been accused, tried, convicted, and my execution was being carried out. I had become gay overnight. Previously, I was somewhere towards the middle of the social ladder; friendly enough but a little strange. This push was enough to knock me off. I had been blackballed; it was dangerous to be with me lest rumors as to your own sexuality arise, and living in Small Town, America to hate what everyone believed me to be was expected. All of this was on top of the fact that I was going through the same rigors of entering adolescence that made the rumors so entertaining to my peers. There is very little to write about over the next four years. I was attacked a couple of times, and my grades started to fall; I had taken to sleeping through class so no one would bother me. I hated the world and the world hated me back. Not to belabor the point; I cannot say, "Looking back it wasn't so bad;" it was. When I imagine what Hell is like; I imagine being completely alone. That makes me so sorry for al the people who haven't found God, but I also can't imagine how He could let anyone suffer such pain for eternity. Anyway, that's all in my poems. Gradually over time the rumors started to fade away; it got old, some people forgot and others got politically correct and supported my "life decision". Bear in mind, I am not, nor ever have been gay. I tried to shut out the world and I started to escape in computers, books, and sleep. By the end of my sophomore year things had settled down. People left me alone, and I still hated them all. Not to discount my family, but I kept most of this to myself, and I doubt they will ever really know what I was going through. Enter Mr. Cameron Justin Brooks, when everyone else had let it die he resurrected it. Nearly that entire year I went to sleep each night thinking of killing him, myself, and most of the time both of us. Cameron was having a hard time adjusting, and he was often under attack from some of the students lacking certain prosocial qualities, I affectionately call them stupid jackasses, but regardless of how low Cameron was; I was lower. He needed only to shift the attention to me and he was left alone. Boy, I hated him.</p>

<p>The reason I am detailing how much I hated myself and humanity is not a play on the reader's sympathy; all people go through hard times. Trials and tribulations tear away the superficial portions of our lives and they build character. I do not desire the reader's pity. Pity implies, like patronization, that my position is in some way inferior to someone else's; which I still refuse to accept. The primary reasons I included my hard times are: one, they are an integral part of my development that have given me a deep appreciation of the gifts that I have been given, and the talents that I gleaned from my trials. I am now much more introspective than I was before; I am simply more "in tune" with myself. I have a great deal of self-control and writing poetry is now a hobby of mine; one I am almost certain I would not have, had I not been turned inward. Second, the preceding narrative serves as a stark contrast to the life I am working towards.</p>

<p>The transition from the second part of my life to the third is progressing much slower. I see the destination that I wish to reach, but it is still hard to forget the vengeful sword of fear and hatred cleaving my skull. My disgust in my situation began to overpower my fears slowly after my sophomore year, but the event I believe marked my decision to climb out of my hole of self-pity came at a fitting time. My church group went to a United Methodist Event called "Resurrection." The week, as a whole, was fairly plain, but on the last day I was faced with a choice. The speaker called for anyone who wanted to dedicate their lives to God to come forward. No one in my youth group got up, and no one around me got up, but I wanted to. I felt called to stand. The only problem was that in order to do so I had to be different; I had to call attention to myself, and that was the most frightening thing I could imagine. So I said to myself, "This is where you choose whether you are going to keep fighting on your own in the ways of the world, which is not working, or you can try something different. What have you got to loose?" I stood up and went forward, and I truly asked God to help me change my life or live in the world I was in. I can't say that I immediately felt a change and all of a sudden I was glad to be alive, but I did try being truly nice to people who were cruel, and I prayed for ol' Cameron. I think my life was changed because of it. A girl from my church was singing in a choir. She invited me to an event called "Assembly" which changed my life. All of the people were so friendly and they went out of their way to make me feel loved. I went home from that meeting on a "spiritual high." I was elected president of my youth group, and I started to get involved. Mr. Cameron Justin Brooks is now literally my best friend and I am his. I have been at Tennessee Tech for a week, and I have spoken to him three times; my parents five. I began to get involved with school my junior year, and my senior year: I ran cross country; was on the wrestling team; served as the co-council for the prosecution on the mock trial team, with Cameron and another girl; was the Coat-of-Arms bearer for the T.H.S. Madrigal Singers; was a member of the scholar's bowl team; worked for the drama department's fall show; worked on the yearbook staff, and I was the only student who was credited with a byline on an article; left the Odyssey of the Mind team, as a member in good standing from my junior year, because of a scheduling conflict with wrestling; was a member of the Key, Leo, Environmental Awareness, French, Cadmea (Yearbook), FCA, 59'ers Civil War Reenactment, and Bible clubs; and several other minor activities that I really don't recall. This summer I began with a "senior" beach trip to Hilton Head, South Carolina for a week. Then I spent the next two weeks touring with the Salt & Light United Methodist Touring Youth Ensemble. When I returned, I was home for less than a week before I left for Assembly, which was my last year as a pupil, but I talked to someone about coming back as a counselor. Finally, when I returned from Assembly I spent every day from 8:00 AM - 10:00, or later, PM working in my father's congressional campaign. We put up a good fight and overcame some unimaginable odds, but in a Republican primary with eleven candidates and some other very impressive campaign statistics that I won't go into here, we lost by around 300 votes out of 85,000 cast, which is in the area of a third of a percent. Statistically, that is pure chance. Ah well, life goes on, and we will have another chance in a couple of years.</p>

<p>My duty now I am in college is to try to maintain my highest possible level of performance in the physical, metal, and spiritual portions of my life. I am a member of the Chorale, and am starting to get into a regular exercise routine that includes running a couple of miles every morning and some weight lifting. At the First United Methodist Church on Sunday, I talked to the youth director about becoming a counselor, and I hope to be active in the Wesley Foundation and some of the other Christian organizations. I am intelligent enough to realize the complete turnaround my life has taken, and that I am not responsible. I believe the best way to show my appreciation to God is to dedicate myself to doing the most that can be done with my gifts, and to enjoy the life I have been given.</p>
