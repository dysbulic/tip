      <p>Question #1: Chart the progress of your self-esteem through the course of the class. How do you think that it has been affected?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Oh boy, a meta-cognition question, I get to see how good I am at observing my thought processes and recognizing general trends. Hmm, how to go about this? I have been considering this and I think that the background to view the changes in my self-esteem against would be my dealings in interpersonal relationships.</p>
    <p>Before I get into the specifics of this semester let me give a bit of background so that you can have an idea of where I was starting from. People have frightened me very much for about as long as I can remember. Some bad experiences in high school soured my faith in people and though I have recognized that people do not live to make me suffer analytically, recognizing that truth emotionally has been a very difficult challenge for me.</p>
    <p>I began this semester on a rough note relationship-wise. For about the last two weeks of Christmas vacation I was aware that a decision had been made on the part of my then girlfriend Danyel Bruggink. I was not sure what exactly the decision was, but I was running 95% odds on the fact that she was going to break up with me. The day that I got back my suspicions were confirmed. The process that I went through self-esteem-wise in relation to that was an interesting one. At the beginning my self-esteem seemed to go up just a bit. I was feeding myself a lot of positive reinforcement of my desirability combined with an objective analysis of mine and Danyel's relationship. I would not call it false exactly. The positive things that I was noticing in myself were there and are there, also my critical analysis of what happened I still consider to be largely clear and centered. It was not an intensely emotional view of the situation though. I was holding myself in a very rational place and was not dealing with low self-esteem mindtalk statements. It was false in that those statements, even though they may be false in and of themselves, are a part of who I am and in being strictly rational about what happened and not including my mindtalk I was being false to the reality of who I am.</p>
    <p>I recognized analyticically this fact from the beginning, but I was content for a while at least to let myself use the analytical shielding as a defense against the pain. My experiences in high school left some very deep wound in my self-esteem and one of the processes that I recognize in reaction to an event that I do not like is to obliterate any positive concept of myself. I lose my humanity and go into a pit wherein I have no value to myself or others whatsoever. It is a distinctly non-rational process and as such is difficult to describe. I do not enjoy doing it and the rational detachment from the mindtalk was mainly to avoid doing that. Using the concept structure that is used in SEE has been limited in the success that I have had in addressing this. The SEE processes rely on objective verification and when I get to that part I tend to simply detach from the negative statements rather than removing them. There is always a small voice that is saying &quot;it doesn't matter what you tell yourself, deep down you know that this is true.&quot; The only really effective tool that I have found in getting rid of that is to go out and have experiences.</p>
    <p>As the semester progressed I got more into the emotional side of mine and Danyel's breakup. I found that I had several friends who were willing to listen to me go through all the different ideas and sensations that I was dealing with. In my friendships I think that a new level of honesty was added on my part. About a month passed and I got to a deeper place in my relationship with Wayne Douglas and also with Dennis Hale. Last semester I had slept nearly every night at Danyel's house and I no longer had that option, so I was back in the dorms. My room however had become accustomed to my absence and a good many people had taken to staying there until very late. It was noisy and I did not like being in there, so I took to hanging out in Wayne and Dennis' room while I was in the dorms. As an extravert, one of my primary methods of processing information is to talk about it, also I like to have a variety of perspectives when I am thinking about something so I like for other people to talk too. I raised the conversation level in Wayne and Dennis' room significantly. This was important in getting a more solid foundation for my self-esteem, as I could observe that I was desirable to talk to and capable of carrying on an enjoyable conversation. Simply sitting and talking helped to decay the picture of myself as worthless and undesirable.</p>
    <p>After a while I could feel that I was getting more centered in my reaction to mine and Danyel's breakup and I decided that I wanted to be involved in another relationship. Another theme that is running simultaneously with these other events is my concept of my capacity for love. At the end of Christmas I found a place in myself that I had not recognized previously. From here I was capable of truly caring about people and opening myself emotionally, or more aptly I was capable of opening myself emotionally to an extent that I had not recognized before. I was very excited about this, and I thought that I could maintain this in mine and Danyel's relationship. I didn't get the opportunity, but I do not think that I could have even if we had not broken up. It is a level of true vulnerability wherein I really do get hurt if I person chooses to do so and it is very hard to maintain that.</p>
    <p>A lot of what was driving my desire to be in another relationship was a desire to test my ideas about my desirability. Also, I wanted a matrix within which to experiment with different types of being. The maintaining vulnerability is something that is tied to high self-esteem as well, my capacity to do that is dependent on my faith in myself that I will be able to handle the repercussions if I do not like the way that things go.</p>
    <p>So, I began to look around for a person who I found attractive. I ended up going out with Julie Vincent after about a month of being single. Many of the aspects of our relationship are things that I am still uncertain about and I do not have a very clear picture about what has gone on or what is going on. I can see ways that I am being pushed towards dishonesty by low self-esteem statements, but there is still such a thick layer of disclarity that I am not really certain of anything. My goal right now is simply to not let my fear of her leaving drive me to lie to her about what I am thinking, while at the same time maintaining a sense of thankfulness that I have this relationship available to me.</p>
    <p>As for ongoing projects for me self-esteem-wise, I am still dealing with Danyel and trying not to be dishonest in my relationship with Julie. I am trying to be bolder in my dealings with people and stand firm in the fact that I do have validity as a person and I have a right to have my voice heard. I think that an important part of my progression Perry-wise will be related to the emotional segregation that I maintain between other people and myself, a concept that somehow they know a set of rules that I am unaware of and I must not say or do anything lest I break a rule. In essence that I do not have authority. The realization that other people don't know what they are doing either and that I can act as though I do have been two important realizations for me this past semester. On the whole I just want not to be ruled by fear anymore.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>Question #2: What would you have done differently in teaching the SEE class?</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>It is difficult for me to address this question because I had experience with the SEE concept structure before I began the class, so I do not have the perspective of a SEE virgin so to speak. On the whole, though this is forever a problem in dealing with groups involved with introspection, I think that the class would have been more productive on the whole if there had been more group bonding. Perhaps if people had been made more uncomfortable and then experienced support. I think that the basic ideas were communicated well, though I got the impression that several people were learning them like rules rather than recognizing them as parts of reality, but that I think is something that has to do with the individual.</p>
    <p>I would conduct the course much the same way as it was done this time. I do not know that it is feasible to form a solid supporting group from such a wide range of individuals who meet for such a limited time. If I were to try to change an aspect of the course that is what I would address.</p>
