    <p class="salutation">Dear Mr. Lamere,</p>

    <p>In response to your advertisement of a summer internship position with the Search Inside the Music project / Project Aura (requisition #557786), I am submitting this resume for review.</p>

    <p>From our call, I understand the purpose of this internship is to take several years of work from disparate sources and develop it into a coherent product. Ten years experience developing software has given me the skills needed to see this project completed. Depending on the exact state of the codebase, three months could be a relatively short period to launch a product of sufficient polish to gain momentum. Organizing classes while teaching in Mauritania, a year and a half contracting in Washington DC, and this past semester as a Ph.D. student at Vanderbilt all dealt with frequent hard and fast deadlines. Whether it was a site advertising an event or a scheduled research trial, I have learned to come up with a realistic plan and adjust it to meet deadlines. I understand the necessity of finding a balance between development time, catching the eye of users, and, if the system is open-sourced, providing the structure contributors need to feel productive.</p>
    
    <p>My resume details my work experience, but I have several pertinent contributions to open-source projects as well. Recently, I have submitted patches to the MusicBrainz Picard tagger. Working previously with Java3D, I co-wrote a set of classes for j3d.org to create efficient screen overlays. On the Python front, the Apport project recently integrated code I wrote to do multipart POSTs into Ubuntu. Additionally, this past semester I prepared a literature survey covering a few of the papers in the field of MIR which gave me a good working sense of the technologies and methods involved.</p>

    <p>I've always enjoyed music, but the issue began to focus on recommendations while in Peace Corps. Over the course of my service, I became increasingly involved in providing music for parties. I learned how hard it is to collect a set of songs that a diverse group will want to dance to. The search for music grew into a project called "1001 Good Songs." As a part of the chit-chat that goes with meeting a new person, I started asking for three songs that should be included in the list of the thousand best songs ever. It's been a couple of years now and the hundreds of recommendations I've gotten have done quite a bit to introduce me to interesting new artists. It's shown me that there's a huge amount of good music that people would like if they only had a chance to hear it. I believe that Search Inside the Music could be a part of finding a technical solution to that problem.</p>

    <p>I am currently enrolled at Vanderbilt University. I will be available for the summer from May 5<sup>th</sup> to August 15<sup>th</sup>. If you need any additional information, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:Will%20Holcomb%20%3Cwholcomb@gmail.com%3E">wholcomb@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <p class="signature">Thank you for your consideration,</p>
