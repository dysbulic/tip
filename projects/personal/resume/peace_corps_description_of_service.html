    <h1>William James Holcomb</h1>
    <h1>Information and Communication Technology</h1>
    <h1>Islamic Republic of Mauritania</h1>
    <h1>15 September 2003 - 22 December 2005</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>After successfully completing the Peace Corps application
    process, William Holcomb received an invitation to serve as an
    Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Development Agent
    in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, West Africa. Following an
    eleven-week pre-service training program, Mr. Holcomb was assigned
    to the Cisco Academy at the University of Nouakchott, in the
    capital of Mauritania. Mr. Holcomb also served in a consulting
    capacity to several public and private organizations, helping both
    with training in the maintenance of existing systems and
    developing appropriate solutions for unmet needs. Primary among
    these organizations were the Peace Corps' Girls Mentoring Centers
    for which Mr. Holcomb developed an extensive automated
    multi-language software configuration.</p>

    <h2>Pre-Service Training</h2>

    <p>William Holcomb began his Peace Corps training on 27 June 2003
    in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and four days later proceeded to
    the Islamic Republic of Mauritania to complete a ten-week training
    program in the rural regional capital of Ka&eacute;di. During this time
    Mr. Holcomb lived with a Mauritanian family in order to facilitate
    his integration into Mauritanian culture and to offer him
    opportunity to practice the languages he was learning. The
    structured classroom portion of the training program was broken
    down as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>164.5 hours of French language training</li>
      <li>105 hours of training on businesses and technology in Mauritania</li>
      <li>39 hours of information on Peace Corps administration</li>
      <li>36 hours of training in cross-cultural communication</li>
      <li>16 hours of training on personal health</li>
      <li>14 hours of training on safety and security</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At the end of this training, a certified language trainer
    tested Mr. Holcomb as intermediate high in French. He was retested
    at the end of his service as intermediate high in French.</p>

    <h2>Service</h2>
    
    <p>Upon completion of his training on September 15, 2003, Mr.
    Holcomb was sworn in as a Peace Corps Volunteer and assigned to
    Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. Mr. Holcomb's service
    developed the technology related capacities of Mauritanian
    institutions in a variety of ways:</p>

    <h3>Cisco Certified Academy Instructor</h3>

    <p>Mr. Holcomb's primary assignment was to the Cisco Academy at
    the University of Nouakchott. This Academy was established as a
    part of the United Nations Least Developed Countries Initiative and
    aimed at strengthening the information technology service industry
    in Mauritania by offering Cisco Certified Network Administrator
    (CCNA) preparation courses.</p>

    <p>Mr. Holcomb's first six months were spent as an assistant
    instructor concerned with overseeing laboratory learning exercises
    and answering student questions. These classes required ten hours
    of classroom time a week. Upon completion of his Academy
    Instructor training, Mr. Holcomb began teaching classes as the
    primary instructor with a Mauritanian assistant. Mr. Holcomb
    continued in this role, teaching ten hours a week for three school
    semesters of four months apiece. During his tenure, Mr. Holcomb
    was instrumental in graduating approximately 75 students from
    different semesters.</p>

    <h3>Technology Development Agent</h3>

    <p>Mr. Holcomb's role as an adviser in technological matters began
    initially from his simple habit of keeping regular office hours in
    his laboratory at the University. During the course of his time
    there he was in the lab from noon until he taught in the evening.
    As word of his free technical advice began to spread he received
    one or two visitors a day with various questions. The student's
    enrolled in the University's Java programming, C++ programming and
    web design classes were primary among these, but he also saw a
    broken laptop or misconfigured desktop at least once every two
    weeks.</p>

    <p>The projects that Mr. Holcomb was consulting on became more
    complex as time went on. One of the first off-site projects was a
    proposal for a router and GSM channel bank combination to work
    with Atlantic.com's VoIP business plan. He also did training with
    the information technology support staff of several organizations
    to help them deal with specific issues ranging from BSA's DHCP
    server configuration to ISET's migration to a Linux domain
    controller to PACTEC's construction of a NAT and proxy server.</p>

    <p>Mr. Holcomb handled requests for technology advice not only
    from Mauritanians, but also from Peace Corps. This included
    innumerable small questions on issues such as accessing the
    website (http://mr.pcvs.org) and listserv he created for the
    volunteers. Also, however it included some larger projects such as
    a two week stay in 'Ayo&#xFB;n to oversee the installation of an EDDI
    funded computer lab, diagnosing and repairing the solar system for
    a lab in Maal, and the rewiring and reconfiguration of a lab run
    by Nissa Bank.</p>

    <h3>Website Developer</h3>

    <p>Mr. Holcomb dealt with University students with web design
    questions on a regular basis as well as helping the web
    administrator at the American Embassy with her initial site
    development. He was also responsible for rewriting the Cisco
    Academy's website (http://www.cisco-academy.mr) and the
    development of a new dual language site for the NGO
    ECO-Development (http://www.ecodev.mr).</p>

    <h3>Girls Mentoring Centers</h3>
    
    <p>Mr. Holcomb spent a significant amount of time troubleshooting
    issues for the twelve Girls Mentoring Centers in cities across the
    country. Each of these centers has at least one computer and Mr.
    Holcomb visited every center at least once during his service.
    Finding appropriate software in an environment where the only
    non-local language some people know is Arabic and for others it is
    French is challenging. Mr. Holcomb collected software packages for
    word processing, reference and education during his service and
    ended by producing a seven CD multilingual automated install.</p>

    <h3>English Education</h3>

    <p>For the last six months of his service, Mr. Holcomb taught
    English at IMA, a Mauritanian run business school. He taught both
    beginning and advanced classes for between six and ten hours a
    week. Mr. Holcomb received a letter of commendation from IMA for
    the reviews given by his students.</p>

    <h2>Non-Competitive Eligibility for Federal Employment</h2>

    <p>Pursuant to section 5(f) of the Peace Corps Act U.S.C. 2540 (f)
    of April 10, 1963, as amended, any former volunteer employed by
    the United States Government following his or her Peace Corps
    Volunteer service is credited for the purpose of retirement,
    seniority, reduction of force, leave, and other privileges based
    on length of government service.</p>

    <p>This is to certify in accordance with Executive order 11103 of
    April 10, 1963, that William Holcomb served satisfactorily as a
    Peace Corps Volunteer. His service in Mauritania was completed on
    15 December, 2005. The benefits under the executive order extend for
    a period of one year after termination of volunteer service,
    except that the employing agency may extend the period up to three
    years for a former volunteer who enters military service, pursues
    studies at a recognized institution of higher learning, or engages
    in other activities which, in view of the appointing authority,
    warrant extension of this period.</p>
