    <h2>Specific experience:</h2>

    <p>Another experience that required the integration of some old knowledge with some new was setting up a network in the house I rent (with 5 other people) at school. We pulled cat5, fished wires in the walls, put in blocks and punched everything down. The house is running off a central broadband connection, but I configured a Linux firewall to do address translation as well as DHCP for the network and serving as a fileserver.</p>
