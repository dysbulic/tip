    <p class="salutation">Dear Ms. Green,</p>

    <p>In response to your advertisement of a web administrator
    position, I am submitting this resume for review. I received
    notice of the position through a friend who forwarded the
    information through <a
    href="http://www.idealist.org">idealist.org</a>.</p>

    <p>I believe that my experience and skills with XHTML and CSS
    would be an excellent match to your requirements. I have worked
    with both the refactoring and redesign of several sites and my
    knowledge of the applicable standards is extensive. Three examples
    of my recent work are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>julbrew.gm</strong>: [<a class="button"
      href="http://odin.himinbi.org/julbrew.gm.original/">original</a>
      / <a class="button"
      href="http://odin.himinbi.org/julbrew.gm/">refactor</a>]:
      Julbrew is the primary distiller and bottling company in the
      Gambia. Their site made extensive use of nonstandard HTML and
      this refactoring maintained almost exactly the original
      appearance, but changed the structure of the files
      extensively.</li>

      <li><strong>cisco-academy.mr</strong>: [<a class="button"
      href="http://odin.himinbi.org/cisco-academy.mr.original/">original</a>
      / <a class="button"
      href="http://odin.himinbi.org/cisco-academy.mr/">refactor</a>]:
      Cisco operates networking academies across the developing world
      as part of the UN's Least Developed Countries Initiative. The
      refactoring of the site for the Academy at the University of
      Nouakchott maintained the majority of the original design, but
      did remove some gaudier elements.</li>

      <li><strong>ecodev.mr</strong>: [<a class="button"
      href="http://odin.himinbi.org/ecodev.mr.original/">original</a>
      / <a class="button"
      href="http://odin.himinbi.org/ecodev.mr/">redesign</a>]:
      ECO-D&eacute;veloppement is a nongovernmental organization aimed
      at improving environmental conditions in Mauritania. They wanted
      both to make their site bilingual and add a section allowing
      them to apply for financing from foreign donors. These
      requirements necessitated a more complete redesign of the site
      with the basic appearance modeled on a paper brochure prepared
      at the same time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I also have over eight years of Linux server administration
    experience running servers with sites actively on the internet. I
    am familiar both with configuration and software associated with
    properly hardening a server against attack. I worked helpdesk
    servicing Apple computers for a year and a half and am also
    comfortable with that environment.</p>
    
    <p>As for my opinions of national marijuana policy, I consider it
    a misguided waste of resources. The majority of the issues are
    based on inaccurate information and preconceptions rather than
    either accurate science or first-hand experiences. That people are
    in jail for possession or consumption of marijuana is silly. That
    the government is spending millions to incarcerate people and keep
    them in jail while there are so many real problems in the world
    that need addressing is a tragedy. The United States' ability to
    be a responsible player in the world is grounded in the clarity of
    its people's values. The current national attitude toward
    marijuana is causing time and attention to be unnecessarily drawn
    from more important issues and I would like to work to fix
    that.</p>

    <p>I am currently a Peace Corps volunteer serving in Mauritania.
    My contract ends December 15<sup>th</sup>. My availability to
    start employment is January 10<sup>th</sup>. If you you need any
    additional information, feel free to contact me at <a
