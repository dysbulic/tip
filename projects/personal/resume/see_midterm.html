      <p>#2. Branden says, &quot;No one is coming to save you.&quot; What does this mean? Do you agree with it? What impact, true or false, does it have on your life and what you choose to do next?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Branden's statement ties into his concept of self-responsibility, that a person has control over how they choose to respond to situations and responsibility cannot be shunted off onto someone else. I personally agree with him.</p>
    <p>One of my classic dramas is a victim drama or a martyr drama where I am beaten down by the hard cruel world and I somehow loose responsibility for my actions because of the extreme circumstances under which they occur. This is simply a lie, and when I act as though it were the truth I am not living in conjunction with reality; I am delusional. The ramifications that facing this lie has on my life has been a greater sense of what I guess I would call my personal power. Things don't always go the way that I want them to, but less and less often am I faced with feelings of helplessness and impotence. At the very least I find it to be a more satisfying existence and also I find that as I choose to recognize my control of my life I am better able to make the things that I want to happen occur. I have found that much of the delusion of helplessness served to not only to put me in an emotional state that was reactive and not productive, but it also wasted energy that when focused at making changes rather than whining was able to have real repercussions on the my surroundings.</p>
    <p>It is still a challenge oftentimes to take responsibility especially when I am faced with a task wherein I don't know what the best course of action to take is, but I am getting better at picking something to try and doing it rather than sitting and feeling helpless. If what I choose doesn't work then I can pick something else. I especially like to try and be melodramatic about the consequences of my actions, and learning to look at them less seriously and seeing that the world won't end if I mess up has been a help too.</p>
    <p>To say that no one is coming to save me is much like when Nietzsche said &quot;God is dead &hellip; and it is we who must replace him.&quot; It is up to me to see that I get what I want from my life; there is no higher power, be it natural or supernatural, that is going to intervene and make everything like I want it to be. I am in charge of seeing that I am satisfied with my life and I am the only being with the power to see that this happens.</p>
    <p>In practical terms it means that I stop laying blame.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>#3. Discuss the difference between self-esteem and self-justification. Use at least three examples from your own life.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The main difference that I usually see between self-esteem and self-justification is that self-justification seems always to be based in power structuring; there is an unequal duality, whereas with self-esteem the choice is centered in who I am and there is no comparison to other people.</p>
    <p>A choice that is based out of self-esteem has the reasoning, &quot;this is my choice.&quot; There are analytical processes that go into making the choice, but the power that supports the choice is not externally based. Self-justification has an external basis and the reasons that I make a self-justified choice is because of something outside of me. I am not trying to say that choices based out of self-esteem are in some way insulated from reality, if anything they are more in tune with reality because when I am working out of self-esteem I am not letting my fears of the consequences of my actions force me into a certain decision.</p>
    <p>Self-esteem based decisions are proactive whereas self-justified ones are reactive. A decision based out of self-esteem is formed out of a clear rational process whereas a decision based out of self-justification is made to conform to needs and fears.</p>
    <p>Like most concepts, self-esteem and self-justification are not polar qualities, most decisions are made out of a combinations of both. I am tempted to lean towards self-justification all of the time, especially in situations where I am uncertain or uncomfortable. I have the impulse to justify myself all of the time in relation to my relationships of various forms. I have a deep seated fear of being left isolated and alone and my reactions to this often serve as the basis for self-justified decisions. As my capacity to see the fact that I am reacting to something increases, so has my capacity to stop reacting, and more and more my decisions are made based out of clarity and choice rather than fear and delusion.</p>
