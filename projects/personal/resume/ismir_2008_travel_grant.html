    <p>As a Peace Corps volunteer (PCV), I was one of the few with
    consistent internet access. For this reason, it fell to me to
    collect music for the occasional PC soire&eacute;. The
    opportunities to hang out with a bunch of Americans were rare
    enough that all parties were special, but the best events were
    those with a little dancing. So, I set about trying to do my
    service to the partygoers and give them a bit of fun.</p>

    <p>Like any good computer scientist, my work began with a
    systematic contemplation of the problem. I eventually noticed that
    traffic would come and go on the dancefloor, but only so long as
    there were people out there&hellip; An empty dancefloor can take
    hours to fill. So, I wanted my algorithm to minimize empties
    instead of perhaps aiming for a higher average.</p>

    <p>Ideas filled my head, and slowly I tracked the pattern to "you
    have to know your audience." I could pick the songs for general
    dancability, but what really kept the people on the floor were
    songs that they knew. Since there were only 150 Americans in the
    country, and 70 of them were PCVs, I was only sampling from the 55
    of the 70 that were well-suited (or learned to be) to the drunken
    debauchery of a Peace Corps party. I eventually knew the favorite
    songs of almost every single volunteer in the country in my
    attempt to get them on the dance floor.</p>

    <p>It worked great. If the point of music is to leave people with
    a memorable evening, I helped a couple parties see the sun come
    up.</p>

    <p>I started to think of how I could take this idea and make it
    work if the sample population was ten or a hundred thousand. I
    dreamed of opening a bar in DC where folks could try foods and
    songs from all over the world. I'd outfit it with RFID tags, touch
    sensitive pads &mdash; big LEDs with slick graphics. They could
    use these screens to answer questions from the bar. Did I mention
    the bar would learn how to make the people as happy as possible?
    The environment would be a reinforcement learning algorithm.
    Automate as much of it as possible. Set a general theme and
    clientele, but once you've built up a regular crowd, give more and
    more control over to the machine. Let people <a
    href="http://www.kegbot.org">pour their own beers</a> and order
    drinks from their seats if they don't want to fight to the bar.
    Let the simple benefits of losing their privacy pay them back for
    giving it up.</p>

    <p>I would let the dancers tell the computer what they wanted to
    hear. I've frequently been on the dancefloor and wanted to give
    the DJ a piece of my mind for playing crap. My ideal bar would let
    them do that. I started to think then about how the computer would
    decide what to play, and realized many of the questions don't have
    answers yet. It's an open science and one that we are just
    starting to have the tools to address. What an awesome
    experimental setup this bar would be. </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If I play a series of mushy love songs will it reduce churn
      on the dancefloor/bar barrier?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I would think it would make pairings between couples more
    frequent. Perhaps the young men and women would get a bit braver
    and talk to the person they've had their eye on, but were perhaps
    a bit reluctant to approach. I would expect pairs to have a lower
    likelihood or movement since the party has to come to agreement.
    The extent to which I analyzed the potential patterns in damned
    near every situation put a strain on my relationships for a
    bit.</p>
    
    <p>I want to build that bar. This is why I want to go to ISMIR.
    Music informatics is the cutting edge of research on the
    relationship between the codifiable characteristics of sounds we
    enjoy and human behavior. I'm going to be awash in data: who and
    where people are and what they do. This is no simulator. You get
    to run questions on actual groups of people.</p>

    <p>They might actually start coming more if you tell them you're
    studying the science of how to make them happier.</p>

    <p>So, I'm in recommender systems, learning to guess what people
    want. ISMIR will provide me a broader exposure to the field than I
    have gotten to date &mdash; the entirety of my formal MIR training
    being a self-directed literature survey for a general AI class.
    There's also the possibility that I will make useful contacts that
    might help me find a route from my current computer science Ph.D.
    to one in a school with a solid sociology program. I don't know
    anyone with a CompSci undegrad who has gone into a sociology
    doctorate program. I hope to also to talk to people from various
    schools and find out if this would be a potential path for even
    the brightest of students, let alone someone with my mottled
    academic career.)</p>

    <p>I am, despite the largess of Sun Microsystems furnishing and
    paying me handsomely to work on Project Aura this summer, not a
    man of significant means. Any charitability that you might feel
    would certainly be appreciated.</p>
