      <li>General Notes
      <ul>
        <li>Models of mentoring
        <ul>
          <li>Wisdom comes from Mentor</li>
          <li>Wisdom comes from student</li>
          <li>Wisdom comes from student and is enhanced by group</li>
          <li>Cf. Browning: "God uses us to help each other so, lending our minds out." —Fra Lippo Lippi</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Video tape typical mentor meeting?</li>
        <li>Openness vs. confidentiality: name them, frame them, fame them</li>
        <li>Mentor List
        <ul>
          <li>Begun by Frank Fujita to try to continue mentoring environment.</li>
          <li>Originally very structured: a book a month, movie bi-weekly</li>
          <li>Frank eventually gives up on this and opens it to general discussion</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Things evolve: don't stay attached to your original structure</li>
        <li>Younger students are helped by seeing former/older students: they introject maturity, but also see them as less advanced, see them continuing the work</li>
        <li>Pain and struggle: working on one issue pulls in other things "stuck to it." When it explodes, it's like chewing gum stuck on it; something that doesn't belong seems to be hooked in</li>
        <li>Secret program vs. open program</li>
        <li>Sofas made the difference</li>
        <li>Learning by doing vs. learning from books: you need the principles and the vocabulary, but you need to do it, too</li>
        <li>Many students don't want to "get deep"</li>
        <li>What does the student think he's doing, vs. what Connie thinks he's doing?</li>
        <li>Sufi model works best: work with what's there. It's all play, all learning</li>
        <li>Card-carrying mystic: strongly S, strongly N, then both integrative</li>
        <li>Mentor can get kids to work on Mentor's pet topics, but also work on what the kids are interested in</li>
        <li>Down side to letting kids see Mentor learn/fumble: can scare off students at Level 0 and Level 1, in whom it can create a lack of confidence in the Mentor and impede the "bonding" process</li>
        <li>Service learning</li>
        <li>"Levels" of Mentor are not age-dependent; they are rather work-dependent and focus-dependent</li>
        <li>Consider business-oriented version of the book: "you can't manage others if you don't understand yourself."</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
