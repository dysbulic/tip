\begin{quotation}
	\hspace{1.5cm}Convergence\\[5pt]
	\noindent I feel my tortured soul begin to rend. \\
	Oh, pity me, that I have left behind \\
	The naked beauty of a newborn mind. \\
	I find it very difficult to bend \\
	Away from roads to which all mortals tend. \\
	For time beyond my portion have I pined, \\
	Though now within my plundered heart I find \\
	A deep and dreadful longing for the end. \\
	For Peace! For Peace! I plead for bless-ed Peace, \\
	That the conducting of this damn-ed dirge \\
	Which is my life might cease! For Peace! For Peace! \\
	Withhold me not from Peace! Completely purge \\
	From me the urge to break apart from Peace! \\
	And then there comes a surge---and I converge. \\
	
	- Neil Cowden
