Your Introduction to Mentor:

Usually I invite a student into my office for a friendly chat. I will have noticed that the student is already a Seeker, asking intelligent questions, unafraid to question the teacher's authority, interested in big ideas, reading and discussing materials outside of those required for class. While we chat, I double check how comfortable the student is in talking with me, how mature the reasoning processes are, how well the student handles a variety of religions and value patterns.

Nowadays the older mentor students and several teachers help me choose the students who will be invited to join Mentor. I interview each student before the invitation is made, to be sure the student is able to understand the rigors of introspective study and to ensure that the student understands the rules:

Mentor students must
1. Attend Weekly meetings of the group
2. Read the email in the group list serv and write at least one journal a week. More is better.
3. Meditate at least 20 minutes a day. Formal meditation.
4. Read the books and see the movies in the Mentor list and discuss in journals and groups 5. Keep what goes on in the meetings and conversations confidential

In addition to these commitments we ask students to attend one More to Life Weekend sponsored by the Kairos Foundation, and to take Melodie Wade's HON 2000-level self esteem and relationship courses. They are very important for your growth. Most students like to go back to MTL and be on team, to continue to get more out of that approach to the Work. (see below for more about Kairos Foundation). The student can drop out at any time. Of he does drop, we ask that he honor the secrecy agreement.
