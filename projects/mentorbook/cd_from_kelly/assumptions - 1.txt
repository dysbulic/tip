Pain is inherent in growth and the pain is valuable
Sharing my work helps my growth and that of the rest of Cor
Willingness to work with Connie on personal growth work
Alcohol and drug use/abuse are detrimental to my growth work
I can choose how I respond in any given situation including how I respond to my emotions
Only I can satisfy my needs, you cannot and I have no justification for expecting such.
Neither Connie nor anyone in Cor can make me grow, it is my choice to be proactive.
I am moving toward a position in which my world consciousness is greater.
The work boils down to being mindful of self and life and making proactive
choices on     that knowledge
Meditation is one of the most useful tools we have.

There are parts of me that I do not live, and things that I live that aren't truly me.
Connie knows what she is doing.

(D.B.)
1) 

 Honesty (as honest as we can get.  a committment to looking at the truth
which means not avoiding things that cause pain or that you don't want to look
at and being honest with yourself about how you feel about them.  Saying I
don't like this or I don't want to do it and doing it anyway)
 Openness (with empathy.  this works with the honesty.  I can't see how you
can healthy have one without the other.  Openness means not just being open
about yourself and things going through your head, but also being open to other
people and their ideas)
 Choosing to love (unconditional positive regard) (being in mentor is a
choice and with choosing to love its a choice to care about the people involved
and perhaps the ideas (the latter feels less true)
 Committment to the process (the process is a necessary part of the work and
learning to live in it feels important to me and to mentor)
 Doing the work (there is a need to be journaling and working through the
assignments that are given out by Connie.  I don't always understand why, but
its important for me to be doing the work anyway even if I don't want to do it,
this includes reading books and then responding to them by journaling about
them, reading them is only one step in the process)

that pain needs to be experienced to learn its lessons
that it is important to have a peer group that is willing to work to move towards these axioms 
that our growth path is not "for" everyone and isn't the right path for everyone
that illegal drugs and excessive alcohol use cloud our perception and minds
(/A.B.)

(J.R.)
** Honesty is the cornerstone of growth.
** You can always say no.
** Thinking you're not codependent is a real good sign of resistance.
** Thinking you're finished with your work is a sign of inflation.
** Wanting to play is usually resistance.
** There is no "good" or "bad" when you're talking about growth.
** You won't ever get "there."  Get over it.
** Your peer group is who you're letting be equal with you.
** How much you trust others is in your head; it's not them, it's you.
(/J.R.)

(L.B.)
Axioms:
 
Where you are is where you need to be, unless you feel called to move somewhere
else; from then on out, until you move, you're not where you need to be.
Commitment to be mindful: of pain, of tapes, of feelings, of others' lives, of
your own process, of creation.

Experience AND observe your life and growth.  Simply observing doesn't cut it.

Conventions: 
Confidentiality is a must.  It builds trust.
Sometimes (often) people need their space to grow.  Allow them to have it.
Only you can know what's right for you.  I can offer suggestions, but I don't
have your answers, only my own.
(/L.B)

(M.R.)
-That buffering thoughts or opinions genuinely felt by the undersigned diminishes himself and the group.
-Tuning in to the wavelengths of ALL other members of the group.
-Wisdom often occurs in UNWANTED places.  Therefore, unwanted places must be visited if learning/growing is to occur.
-That one must first become a fool before the genuis can be found within.
-Every right path involves taking a thousand wrong turns.
-The roadmap of life which the undersigned possesses is constantly being outdated and in need of redrawing.
-Less than 100% commitment is harming both the group and the undersigned.

Therefore, attendence, journaling, keeping up with assignments, and
constant mindfulness are necessary to not diminishing the group or the
self.
