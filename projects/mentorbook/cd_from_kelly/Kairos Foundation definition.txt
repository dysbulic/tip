The Kairos Foundation is an international non-profit organization that
works for world peace by leading a series of seminars on personal
growth and understanding. Their philosophy is that if you really
understand yourself and others you will not feel the need for
aggression and fighting. The group is particularly active in South
Africa (where they helped bring down apartheid), New Zealand, England,
and Canada. The groups nearest to us are in Knoxville and Huntsville.

There are scholarship available for Mentor students. Just ask.

More to Life weekend is the first in the series of steps-by-step
workshops that lead you along the Wisdom Path. It focuses on looking
at yourself, your fears and defenses, your warped mindtalk, your
self-defeating behaviors, and gives you a series of talks for working
with your issues to heal, cure, extirpate, and extinguish
self-defeating thoughts and behaviors. The weekend usually costs about
$125 with student discounts and Mentor scholarships.

The two founders of Kairos, Brad Brown and Roy Whitten, are both
Episcopalian ministers, Jungian counsellors, and Zen masters; and Brad
is a Sufi. They work with the simplest, non-technical ideas and
models, but you will recognize the sources of their work in the Wisdom
Path of the world's great religions.

With this permission, we use Brad Brown's four books of Touchstones,
soft Koans of the work, specifically of the Wisdom Path, as exercises
in Mentor. Usually one student is designated to send out one
Touchstone a day and then everyone writes journal essays about it.
