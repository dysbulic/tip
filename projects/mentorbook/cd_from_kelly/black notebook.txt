A. A list of axioms and assumptions I see in Mentor
1. Don't bounce when others around you are deep.
2. Don't talk about other's personal lives to people outside of Mentor
3. Don't know.
4. Know thyself.5. Listen.
6. Look before you leap when someone else is deep. Leap before you look when you are deep.
7. Rest, if not for yourself, then for the sanity of others.

B. Some of the conventions of the work.
1. You can't possibly understand 100% of the depths of another person, but trying to understand helps him better understand himself.
2. You can't possibly thank any one person enough for all they have done, but one "thank you" is still enough.
3. Who you are now is totally unlike who you will become, but both are beautiful in their own ways.
4. Growth is built on work is built on trust is built on friendship is built on togetherness is built on fun.

C. My commitments and goals in relation to myself and Mentor.
1. Wado-ryu
2. Mentor
(that's all I've got right now. Still thinking about other commitments, particularly religion.)

D. Expectations I have of myself and cor
1. that I'll journal everyday
2. that I'll meditate everyday
3. that I'll go to all the meetings
4. that I'll do what I'm told, always thoughtfully, and under the clause that if I'm not comfortable with it, I'll say so.
5. that I'll flow with Mentor and with cor, within my own flow.
6. that cor will be cor whenever and wherever cor is.

Subj:   commitment statements, journal to follow

Some of my core beliefs:

I am committed to helping the world.

I am committed to helping others grow.  My primary reason for being a member of
this group is not personal growth, but to assist the development of others
through shared experiences.

I trust all of you implicitly and without question or regard to maturity level.
I trust and love anyone needing this group regardless of intellectual level,
personal, religious, sexual, or any other views, beliefs, or practices.

I believe in growth along many axises: spiritual, developmental, social,
personal, rational, religious, and many others.  These axises interact with one
another.  One may not be neglected without detriment to the others.

I am committed to "radical" honesty and being open.

I am committed to my own personal growth and the realization that throughhelping others I develop skills necessary for my continued growth.

I am committed to developing a deeper sense of unconditional love and
compassion.

I am committed to keeping an open mind, and realizing that what I know now is
not absolute and changeless.  "Truth is found in life and not merely in
conceptual knowledge."

I am committed to working with Connie and this group; the honest and open
discussions related to developmental, personal, rational, educational, growth,
and life issues.

I believe that in sharing our values, our thoughts, and our emotions: the good
of each and the bad of each, that we can grow in boundless directions.  I am
committed to this sharing; I hope you can be too.

Subj:   homework on axioms, commitments, cor, etc.

1) Make a list of axioms and assumptions in Mentor

* growth is a "positive" thing and something desirable
* trust in Connie is necessary for growth
* examination and questioning of one's beliefs, values and assumptions is
important for growth
* the 4 Rogerian principles: radical honesty, radical openness, unconditional
positive regard, and empathy
* journaling facilitates growth
* that practices and commitments aid in growth
* experience is of higher value that pure rational methods
* that _Siddahrtha_ is a useful text for evaluating a student's first levels of
commitment
* that Scott Peck's work _The_Road_Less_Traveled_ is a further useful text in
evaluating students
* that there are components to growth which can be generalized and applied to a
wide variety of people
* that Perry, Kohlburg, and Fowler models are reasonably valid (most especially
Perry)* that lower Perry levels are less mature and that growth includes going up the
Perry scale
* that Jungian psychology is reasonably valid
* judgements and expectations of others closes me to them
* that people have distortions
* that life changes and where one is on a certain day will not be the place
where one is forever
* that we choose how to respond to events and stimuli (whether consciously or
not) and that this process can be altered
* we can always walk away
* increase in empathy is something desirable
* that each member supports and is dependent on the others
* that what is shared is confidential
* that no one has the right answers except ones that work for themselves
* that I have to find my own answers
* the ultimately life is not meaningless
* that often other people can see things in my personality that I am blind to
* that each of us projects onto others
* people who are not working on growth aren't "bad" they simply aren't working
on growth
* people who are different are not "bad" or "better", simply different
* pain is inherent in growth
* Rumi is a source of wisdom

2) Conventions of the work

* honesty (to self and others)
* journaling
* sending journals to others (at least to Connie) can help both me and them
* meditation
* the use of Perry, Kohlburg, and Fowler models
* trust in the process
* pain
* write dump / emotional journals without trying to process the statements, and
later go back and look at them rationally and see what is true and what isn't
* confidentiality (both to what is shared and about Mentor in general)
* focus and commitment to being mindful
* guided imagery
* the Progoff process
* working in groups (whether focus groups or totem poles or whatever)
* alcohol and drug abuse are hindrances to growth
* not bragging about or talking about mentor to other people
* some vocabulary: box, projection, shadow, dump, numbered states of depth,
even cor itself (heart in Latin)
* journals and dumps are to be labeled as such, as are touchstones
* meaningful subject lines will be used for e-mail

sub-set for me
* LT processes
* labeling mindtalk as such
* feelings (emotions) and body-sensations are true
* beliefs are true, false or don't know and are not the same as feelings
* that others are not objects of my desires and cannot fill my needs (as
Helminski says, only I can do that) or make me grow.  They can only help create
the spaces for growth.
* that I do not create pain in another person, only create a space for them to
hurt themselves* I cannot control how another person feels or takes what I say, but I am still
to be mindful of my actions

3) Commitments and goals in relation to myself and Cor

myself:
* commitment to journal daily
* commitment to meditate and do yoga daily
* attend daily mass unless I have a meeting or other obligation
* commitment toward developing a SO relationship which includes a commitment to
meeting at least one new person a week, going on a date at least every other
week, smiling at least once a day at someone I don't know, attending all
professional meetings, using someone's name if I know it at least once in the
conversation (includes waitresses and cashiers)
* commitment to honesty (it's more than just telling the truth) both in
personal communications and in my journals
* commitment to expressing my preferences
* commitment to being open with others
* commitment to school and doing class work
* read at least 1 book on the mentor list or recommended by people in mentor a
month
* commitment to doing the work
* commitment to doing the LT processes
* commitment to grow and to becoming more clear
* holding a don't know / non-judgement attitude and remove expectations and
"shoulds"
* not clouding communication with sarcasm, judgement-based humor (i.e., MBTI,
majors), or personal attacks unless said statements are part of a dump /
emotional journal
* evaluating my defenses
* commitment to love and service
* commitment to support Mark with his commitment to yoga and meditation
* to be mindful and aware of my actions and to respond instead of react
* to develop autonomy and interdependence, not codependence (with respect to my
own growth and with my interactions and relationships with others)
* to trust others and accept them as they are, not as I wish they would be
* to work on being social and connecting with other people in the 1st year
class at WI

in relation to cor
* I commit to mindfully and awarely read through everyone's e-mail and make
whatever response is appropriate
* to affirm people for sharing and to support their growth
* to call people on statements that seem to be mindtalk if they have not
labeled them as such
* to respond to e-mail or posts directed to me
* to send out at least one independent journal a week (independent journal is
not a reply to someone)
* to write any "homework" assignments
* to evaluate my reasons for sending e-mail to the cor.dis or to individual
people and see if it is need / ego driven or is from a position of open sharingor from a place where I can help others
* to be honest in my communications with other people and should I see where I
have not been I will communicate that to the person, tell the what is true, and
process why I was dishonest
* to have unconditional positive regard, as much as I am able, for the people
in cor

4) Preferences for myself and Cor

(I don't like the word expectations up there and so I'm going to use
preferences)

I prefer that I carry out my commitments and that I become a more loving, open
human being.  I would like to become more clear and less ego driven because I
see again that I must ultimately forge my own path (that is, autonomy and
interdependence are important things to develop and be aware of) and that until
I work on these areas further growth will be hindered.  I would like to develop
a group of people who can be real in Madison.  I see cor as a place where I can
learn and also share who I am and also help aid in others growth.  I would
prefer that Cor is a group of people who are accepting, committed to growth,
honesty, and being real.  I prefer that people call me on places where I am not
honest either with myself or others, and where I am making judgement statements
or placing demands and accusations on myself or others.  I also prefer that
people commit to the work and focus on being who they are without masks and the
dramas because then I can truly see them.  I would like to get e-mail from each
person on a semi-regular / frequent basis of at least every other week so I can
be aware of where they are and what is important to them.

5) Values

openness
honesty
love
service
compassion
don't know / non-judgement
mindfulness
community
spirituality
making active responses and choices
growth


thanks for reading.

patrick

Subj:   Goals for cor and such


 9-4-97
 Here’s my version of the homework connie gave us last Monday at the Cor meeting

 1) Make a list of axioms and assumptions in Mentor
 2) Conventions of the work
 3) Commitments and goals in relation to myself and Cor
 4) Expectations of myself and Cor

 1) Make a list of axioms and assumptions in Mentor
 Value the 4 rogers axioms:
                               unconditional positive regard
                               radical honesty
                               radical openness
                               empathy
 Pain is inherent in growth and the pain is valuable
 Sharing my work helps my growth and that of the rest of Cor
 Willingness to work with Connie on personal growth work
 Alcohol and drug use/abuse are detrimental to my growth work
 Feelings by definition are true
 Beliefs are not feelings
 I can choose how I respond in any given situation including how I respond to my
 emotions
 I dont know how my journals will affect others.
 Only I can satisfy my needs, you cannot and I have no justification for
 expecting such.
 Neither Connie nor anyone in Cor can make me grow, it is my choice to be
 proactive.
 I am working for autonomy
 I am moving toward a position in which my world consciousness is greater.
 The work boils down to being mindful of self and life and making proactive
 choices on     that knowledge
 Meditation is one of the most useful tools we have.

 2) Conventions of the work

 Dump journals are by definition irrational.  They are not attacks on anyone, but
 an expression of intense emotion.  Rational statements should be made in a
 separate work.

 All journals should be titled “journal:....”

 Journaling is a neccessity.  Journals do not have to be sent out to others but
 it helps both myself and others.

 Journaling at least once a week should be a minimum.

 Dont advertise mentor.  It creates conflict for Connie and the rest of Cor.  It
 also may have an adverse affect on someone’s self esteem.

 We are our own best resources, dont be afraid to ask other people questions,
 especially where they are experts.

 Replying to others journals is beneficial to me and the journaler
 Journals should be as honest as I can possibly make them.  I am not here to
 impress anyone or make myself feel good, but instead to accomplish a set of
 goals.

 You are always free to walk away from any question or event.  You may be asked
 for reasons for walking away

 During group meetings I will be mindful of my desire to talk and determine if my
 comment        contibutes to the current focus of the meeting or if it is for
 personal gratification.        If it is the latter I will note it and keep my
 silence.  If what I have to say is     interesting but not pertinent or my
 question will lead to a long digression I will         write it down and save it for an
 appropriate time.

 Be on time for all meetings

 Do not eat during the meetings as food and bathroom breaks interrupt the entire
 group  and prevent depth work.

 Confidentiality:  I will not discuss information I learn about other people with
 people not                     associated with Cor.  This includes being
 mindful of my location, especially             the Honors Lounge.
 Confidentiality is essential both for Cor and people                   not
 associated with Cor.  Without confidentiality it will be difficult if not
               impossible for the group to bond.

 Do not have sub conversations during group meetings.  If this is a necessity, do
 it out of the room or on paper.

 Bring pen and paper to all meetings.  This is work, not play time.

 Sarcasm, especially during depth work, clouds understanding and is counter
 productive

 3) Commitments and goals in relation to myself and Cor

 My primary commitment to Cor is to send at least one journal a week out to the
 group.
 I commit to responding to journals as I have time.
 Give what gifts I have to give to others
 Receive the gifts others offer to me

 Goals:
 form a sangha with those who are willing to be dedicated to a higher order of
 living as espoused by mentor values
 develop a deeper understanding of self and others
 develop a stronger spiritual life
 develop autonomy
 learn interdependence
 learn tools to assist in mindful living

 My commitments to myself:
 yoga 5 times a week
 20-30 minutes of meditation/chanting 5 times a week
 journaling everyday of some sort
 Reading as I have time commitments to life training
 mindfulness to the extend I am capable at any given time
 Honesty
 thinking/meditating on God and Tao

 4) Expectations of myself and Cor
 honesty
 I expect others to call me when I am not being honest or am being hurtful
 I expect that I will hurt
 I expect the group to bond and be committed to the Work and Cor
 I expect us to be respectful of each other

 5) (not in the homework) my highest values now
 1 honesty
 spirituality
 interdependence
 love
 compassion
 service
 pain
 beauty
 truth
 mindfulness



 Thats it for me now

 peace be with you
 mark

Subj:   journal:  goals assumptions and other assigned thigns...


 1) Make a list of axioms and assumptions in Mentor

       One that I either am not committed to, or more likely jsut whine about
a lot is that the work and pain etc are worth doing.       honesty is good.
       There are parts of me that I do not live, and things that I live that
aren't truly me.
       There is something wrong with being manipulative.
       [I seem to be in a fairly negative mood.  Lots fo reasons.  THe rest of
this should be interesting...]
       Connie knows what she is doing.

 2) Conventions of the work

       Conventions seem to be the formal stuff.  Like doing as will asked, and
labelling journals.  Flagging dumps as such.  That is something I hadn't
reallyh thought much about.  Asking someone before sending something about them
to the group.  Respecting someone's wishes to keep something secret.  Attend
meetings if possible.

 3) Commitments and goals in relation to myself and Cor

This has four parts, but I think I will skip commitments to myself.
Goals for myself
       work on trusting people
       Being mroe aware of what I am doign and why
       trying to figue out how do deal with and experience feelings
commitments to cor
       I am committed to being honest, attending the meetings, and trying to
listen to what peole are really  saying.  Also, I am committed to doing my best
to honor the trust others place in me.
goals for cor
       I hope that the group helps me meet some of my goals, and I hope that
it does the same for others.
       I jsut realized somethign abuot skipping the thing about committing to
mysfl.  At this instant at least, the idea of making a committment to mysfel
doesnt' make sense beucase I can't see a committment wihtout there having to be
somethign external.

 4) Expectations of myself and Cor

Expectations of myself relative to cor
       I expect that I am going to annoy and disagree with some members of cor
       I expect that I will learn a lot from cor.
Expectations for the group
       I expect thta we will all learn a lot, but I have no idea what
direction it will take.

 1) Make a list of axioms and assumptions in Mentor
 2) Conventions of the work
 3) Commitments and goals in relation to myself and Cor
 4) Expectations of myself and Cor

Using Mark's list...but not his answers as I haven't read them yet...
1) Empathy
  Honesty (as honest as we can get.  a committment to looking at the truth
which means not avoiding things that cause pain or that you don't want to look
at and being honest with yourself about how you feel about them.  Saying I
don't like this or I don't want to do it and doing it anyway)
  Openness (with empathy.  this works with the honesty.  I can't see how you
can healthy have one without the other.  Openness means not just being open
about yourself and things going through your head, but also being open to other
people and their ideas)
  Choosing to love (unconditional positive regard) (being in mentor is a
choice and with choosing to love its a choice to care about the people involved
and perhaps the ideas (the latter feels less true)
  Committment to the process (the process is a necessary part of the work and
learning to live in it feels important to me and to mentor)
  Doing the work (there is a need to be journaling and working through the
assignments that are given out by Connie.  I don't always understand why, but
its important for me to be doing the work anyway even if I don't want to do it,
this includes reading books and then responding to them by journaling about
them, reading them is only one step in the process)

The honesty and openness committments in mentor are in my head with Connie and
yourself, but the more I get into the work, the more than encompass more
aspects of my life and people in my life.  When doing or committing to doing
group work, they become a part of the group as well.

2) Conventions of the work...

Rogers 4 axioms...
Learning the vocab, boxes, process, the cure for the pain is in the pain, guest
house, hit by the skimming spoon, Siddhartha, TRLT, mindtalk, life training,
clearing

journalling is probably the biggest convention that I see.  That kind of
dedication, to put what's in your head onto paper.  Working through touchstones
also perhaps falls into this category.

Conferences with Connie also seem to be necessary and talking with her one on
one.  In the middle levels of mentor, this happens less than on either ends,
but is still important as a touch base, one on one place.

Working with groups and in groups.  Learning to lead them and teach the work
and processes.  (the last sentence seems to be less of a convention and more or
something that I'm working on)

Reading the books and responding about them.  As before, reading is just the
first step in the process.
A lot of the axioms and assumptions seem to be part of the conventions, but not
quite the same, can't nail the difference at the moment though.


3) Committments and goals in relation to myself and Cor

To be at meetings every week and to be journalling and working through those
processes.  To be sharing at least some stuff with the group, it doesn't have
to be your whole head, but things that you are working on.  A committment to be
honest and open with empathy.  To try to listen to what other people are really
saying to you and about you.

Those who are out of town don't have to be at meetings and such, but working on
doing the other parts of this work.

For me, I'm committed to being at the meetings every week and the honesty and
openness part when called to it.  That's interesting to say.  I don't feel that
I have to share my entire life or every thought that passes through my head
with the group, though I realize that after reading other people's perceptions
of me this tends to make me a rather mysterious kind of person or one that
isn't understood.  I think one of my goals is to present a less skewed picture
of myself or a more real one, but again this doesn't mean, you get my life.
One of my goals and committments is to work on being a support for people in
the group.  I expect and plan to build some very strong friendships and
strengthen others out of this group, soulmates (?)


4) Expectations of myself and Cor

To be at the meetings every week and to be working on their own work.  I expect
as I said above to strengthen friendships and connections with people in the
group.  To build a community where there can be rest and safety, but also where
the work needs to be done and people are willing to do the work and don't run
off and play when work needs to be done.

Thanks for reading.
Questions and comments are always appreciated...

UPR
that pain needs to be experienced to learn its lessons
that it is important to have a strong guide
that it is important to have a peer group that is willing to work to move
       towards these axioms
that projections, negative mindtalk, and (impulse was to write anger here) are
       unhealthy
that our growth path is not "for" everyone and isn't the right path for
       everyone
that illegal drugs and excessive alcohol use cloud our perception and minds

>  2) Conventions of the work

confidentiality within the group
that we try to live the axioms as well as we can
using journalling to sort out issues, feelings, etc.
label dump journals as such
making an effort not to judge journals (or people in general)
not being harsh or overly critical, except in dumps (hard to phrase this one -
       i am so afraid of conflict of any kind that any kind of criticism can
       feel wrong)
no illegal drug use, no abuse of alcohol

>  3) Commitments and goals in relation to myself and Cor

starting *tonight*, do one TS a day.
commit to honesty and openness tempered with empathy (also a goal w.
       cor)
attend and participate in each cor meeting
work on UPR, especially with dennis and steve
be mindful of mindtalk (myself and others)
become more organized when leading a group
work on counseling techniques
fulfill commitments i've made for this semester (service committee esp.)
not overburden myself or overcommit [after this semester is over, of course ;)]

>  4) Expectations of myself and Cor

i'd like to say i have none, but that's not the case :)

myself:
be as honest as i can, not manipulate what i say or hide things
that i won't lose my empathy when sharing with someone - that i be mindful of
       the effects of what i say
that i hold to my commitments
that i act on my empathy and help instead of just observing
that i be willing to work, face pain, open myself

cor:
that each member make every effort to attend each meeting
that everyone be aware of the effects of what they say (be empathic)
that we are each willing to work to move towards our axioms and ideals
that we are open to each other's ideas with as little judgment as possible

Subj:   my homework

 1) Make a list of axioms and assumptions in Mentor

** Honesty is the cornerstone of growth.
** Commit to Connie and the Work.
** You can always say no.
** Dumps are not rational and shouldn't be responded to as if they were.
** Thinking you're not codependent is a real good sign of resistance.
** Thinking you're finished with your work is a sign of inflation.
** Wanting to play is usually resistance.
** It's ok to resist; running away is part of growth.
** There is no "good" or "bad" when you're talking about growth.
** You won't ever get "there."  Get over it.
** There aren't enough girls in Mentor!
** Your peer group is who you're letting be equal with you.
** How much you trust others is in your head; it's not them, it's you.

 2) Conventions of the work

** The "Journal:" or "Dump:" tag
** Sending journals to Connie
** Commitment to a path
** Reading Sidd, RLT, Rogers

 3) Commitments and goals in relation to myself and Cor

** This one's tougher, and I think I'd rather do another journal on my
commitments.  I can say briefly, though, that my major commitment is to act as
though every person in Cor is my equal.  To that end I commit to journaling and
sending my journals to the group.  I commit to helping others when my expertise
is useful and shutting up when I don't have anything to offer.  I commit to
talking when it is to the point and not to make myself look good.  I commit to
depedestalizing me.  I commit to accepting others as they are, and as they
present themselves; I commit to believing in every person; I commit to loving
every person.

 4) Expectations of myself and Cor

** My expectations of Cor are that everyone will be committed, that everyone
will grow, that everyone will listen to each other, that we'll all find a place
to be open and honest, that we will bond as a group.  I see such potential in
this group, and I don't think anyone else does except for Connie.  It's pretty
awesome, and I'm pulling for it.  I expect myself to have the discipline to
journal and share the journals, and to catch myself when I'm putting me on a
pedestal and knock it down.  I expect others to help me with my work, and I
expect myself to help them.  I expect us to work together as a group to help
each other grow.

Subj:   my journal homework; do i get an A for this?  :)

This is by far an incomplete list.  Just a few things that struck me as very
important right now.

Axioms:
Commitment to love and support each other, from which growth will follow.
Where you are is where you need to be, unless you feel called to move somewhere
else; from then on out, until you move, you're not where you need to be.
Commitment to be mindful: of pain, of tapes, of feelings, of others' lives, of
your own process, of creation.
Experience AND observe your life and growth.  Simply observing doesn't cut it.

Conventions:
Be mindful of how your journals will affect others.  Send explanatory messages
to affected individuals if need be.
Confidentiality is a must.  It builds trust.
Sometimes (often) people need their space to grow.  Allow them to have it.
Only you can know what's right for you.  I can offer suggestions, but I don't
have your answers, only my own.

Goals, Core:
Community.
Become a leadership network for those being called to growth ("minnows").
Strength for the journey.
Change the world together, instead of trying to do it on our own.

Goals, personal:
Find out what being real truly is.
Find God, whoever or whatever he/she is.
Find Lewis, whoever or whatever he is.
Learn how to commit fully.
Integrate my body into growth; I can do the mental, emotional, and spiritual
fairly well.  Body is still lagging far behind.
Listen more completely, without judgements, opinions, filters getting in theway.
Autonomy of values, of action.

CC:     AMH9003
Subj:   goals, commitments, etc assignment

sorry this took so long to send.....  my computer and the vax have not been
getting along well lately



1) Make a list of axioms and assumptions in Mentor
       4 rogers axioms :radical honesty, radical openness, empathy,
unconditional positive regard
       Awareness, self-actualization, work toward personal growth, clearing
thoughts, listening to self and others, commitment, Thoughts/feelings should be
 recognized rather than ignored.

2) Conventions of the work
       journaling, modesty, quiet about cor/mentor, non-elitist, commitment,
focusing,confidentiality, calling others on mindstuff, not
disruptive/distractive, supportive of individuals if not their actions

 3) Commitments and goals in relation to myself and Cor

I see cor as a place intended to promote/allow/encourage personal growth by
bringing together a group, a community, with similar goals of honesty,
openness, trust, support, and awareness.
 I have committed myself to being as truly ME as I know how to be.  I'm
trying to commit (do or do not, there is no try) to learning to be a part of
the process.  I am easily frustrated by the work, and too easily turned away
by my own defenses (competency, insignificance, self-control, laziness,
lack of commitment).  I need, for myself (both for that nebulous growth stuff
 :)  and to prove to myself that I really can do this) to just jump in and
focus.  To ask questions instead of zoning out.  To decide once and for all
whether this is where I need to be.
 that's my cor almost-but-not-close-enough-yet commitment.  sorry if anyone
doesn't deem that worthy.
       other commitments/goals in relation to myself :  I am committed to
allowing myself to be healthy, in as many ways as I see possible - eating,
sleeping, and exercise habits, concentrating on forming healthy, solid
friendships in place of the dating game, doing homework and committing to
actually *learning* material in classes, taking personal time when I need it
to relax or focus my thoughts, working on honesty with myself and others,
allowing the relationship between myself and my parents to become a real
friendship (my mother at least, I wish this were also true of my father now).
Wow!  I didn't realise i'd already made that many commitments to myself this
year!  committed to seeing people more clearly for who they are rather than
what role they play in my life.      (wanting to commit to journaling, butafraid to say that I will because I want to leave myself room to change my
mind.  why can't I just do it!!!!)

 4) Expectations of myself and Cor
       see above paragraph?
       i'm not seeing distinct lines of any sort between these questions.  I
expect myself to dig in and think, write, and discuss with people rather than
merely playing observer.  Easier said than done!
       I expect cor (rationally or otherwise) to bug off and let me work this
out on my own.  nevermind that - I don't think that's necessarily the way cor
works, nor what I really expect.  :)  I don't know - I spose I expect the
group to have some sort of structure, though I have no clue at the moment what
that structure should be.  I expect people to be accepting, but not afraid to
point out both strengths and faults, nor to hear our own strengths and faults.
       I expect myself to give more attention to this work; to really let it
be important to me.  I expect myself to take the time to journal instead of
putting it off indefinitely.



thanks for reading

Subj:   Homework:  Axioms of Growth

Just realized I hadn't sent this out to the group yet (thanks danyel!  :)
For my commitment statements, please use the journal I sent out earlier.

 Growth Axioms
(Axiom is defined here as a self evident or universally recognized truth)
-All personal growth begins and ends with honesty.
-Emotions are as valid as fact.  Be open to them.
-Emotional truth and rational truth are different.
-Individuals matter.
-Accept yourself the way you are; do not deceive, put on false fronts or masks.
-We are all capable of being loved and accepted by others.
-No one is perfect: we do not always function at all times at the level we would
like to.
-"Understanding is risky" By understanding others views we allow ourselves to
change.
-Guest house: accept the validity of negativity and allow it to run its course.
Do not rush in and try to "fix things."
-Personal views change.  Life is a process.  Nothing is fixed.
-You can understand something without believing it; you can believe something
without understanding it; and it doesn't make either one necessarily right.

Subj:   Journal:  Axioms, Assumptions, etc. for Cor

I am more than a week later getting to this.  I've read many of your ideas
involving this "assignment" and agree with a lot.  Not sure if I will actually
add anything new or not, but that is ok.
1)  a) Axioms of Mentor
      Axiom - statement universally accepted as true; established principle
   b) Assumptions of Mentor
      Assumption - an assuming...to take for granted...suppose
      Suppose - to assume to be true
   c) Conventions of Mentor
      Convention - an agreement; customs

2)  a) Goals for me in Cor
      Goals here would be what I want to accomplish be the end of the semester
   b) Commitments for me in Cor
      What I pledge to do for myself and for the group in Cor
3) Expectations of Cor
       Self-explanatory isn't it?

The statements made below are not universally true.  They are not set in stone
and may change at any time after this is sent out.  The below statements are my
personal views and opionions gathered from experience, observations, mindtalk,
other's comments, etc.

1)  a) Axioms of Mentor
       Roger's 4 Axioms: radical openness, radical honesty, unconditional
positive regard, and empathy
       Reading various books especially those on the mentor reading list,
thinking about what is said in those books and how they affect life, and
journaling on these experiences.
       Watching movies such as those listed on the mentor list and writing
down your thoughts on those.
       Some path of growth that is your own...not mimicking other's paths or
trying to follow in Connie's footsteps.

   b) Assumptions of Mentor
       The individual in Mentor has a love or is trying to discover a love for
oneself, others, and for life in general.

   c) Conventions of Mentor
       Confidentiality of information within Mentor and of Mentor.
       Custom of sharing with Connie to provide her with information to help
her help guide you through your work.
       Journaling about thoughts, experiences, life, etc.
       Custom of reading and writing about K. Bradford Brown's Touchstones
       Custom of a special set of vocabulary words
       A commitment to personal growth and your path.

2)  a) Goals for me in Cor
       Get to know some "friends" better.  Become more of a personal
experience (face to face) than an impersonal one (sharing through email).
       Try to better understand other ways of understanding and thinking such
as learning processes by intuition and feeling.
       To recognize who is pushing me and where they are pushing me not just
in Cor/Mentor but also life in general.
       To follow my path at my own relatively comfortable progress...not to be
forced somewhere I don't want to go or get upset and smother my growth in
clouded anger.  Examples would be journaling at my own speed, journaling about
what I choose to examine not what others want me to look at.  Not trying to
conform to a directed goal or path within the Cor group...not trying to out do
others by working harder/faster at journaling/touchstones/growth.
       Try to be as aware as possible (though I'll make plenty of mistakes) on
how I affect others inside/outside of Cor by my journals/questions/replies.

   b) Commitments for me in Cor
       Some things listed under my goals for Cor might apply here also.
       Attend the Cor meetings and various other meetings I'm interested in
related to Cor (subsets such as the dinner group with Aaron, Elijah, and
Steve).
       Be supportive and listen to myself and others (I want to put a
qualifier here for those times/places where I will rebel, etc. to understanding
and supportive).

3)  Expectations of Cor
       For the individuals to be supportive, understanding, and loving to each
others and people outside the group as much as possible.
       Each of us to follow our special, individual path.
       To be aware of your actions during meetings that might be disruptive to
the general mood at the time.
       To come out of this semester of Cor with at least one thing that is
positive and helpful for them or society.
       To understand and appreciate Roger's axioms...to live them as best as
possible.
       To love oneself and others just a little more than before.
       For all of us to learn some "tools" on how to grow on our own without a
group/guide for the possible future without that group support or wonderfully
giving guide.


Remember these are all my present, known ideas...not to be directly placed upon
anybody else.  I think Danyel is working on a more generalized version of this
using everyone's input?  Thanks, Danyel.  Any other disclaimers?? =)

peace people,
Shannon

Subj:   vale of soul making

holy shit. connie, you really understand sometimes. :)

i have been struggling with the world being change and unpredicable
and life being full of suffereing and random circumstance and so
on..... that life is change doesn't line up with my ways of living
often. i'm trying to shift my mindset to where it focuses on the
present and is open to life instead of attempting to keep things
linear leading to perfection.

things wake me up to this...lifeshocks, if you will. for example,
someone dies, i hear of something extremely painful happening, i see a
film which involves parts of life i feel so separate from (like
torture in pan's labyrinth), etc. everything changes, we're all going
to die. i'm scared of those. i want to keep things linear and perfect
and reach some goal or something. it's hard to put it into words
exactly. i think it's an effort of my mind to have control over life
and keep things predictable, keep myself from losing relationships and
love and being alone.

so connie emailed me and said to read the vale of soul making letter
keats wrote and it's so relative to where i am right now. i think i
underestimate your understanding of me at times. i love the intuitivewavelengths you are on with me sometimes. these connections with
people are wonderful and sometimes quoting someone else, giving
someone something to read, or using metaphor or parable are the best
of ways to communicate when you really understand where someone (i
guess an intuitive more often than not) is coming from.

keats is trying to figure out why there is chance and change and
circumstance and pain in life, and his "answer" is that we are
educated and our intelligence (minds) are made into souls through
circumstances which affect the heart ( i would say ....life shocks).
he's struggling. i'm assuming he came out of this?

that we are being made into souls through our pain doesn't cut it
though. b/c what about death and children who die (keats asks this)
and torture and suffereing which is never healed or loved. people who
hurt and hurt and hurt until they are dead? i can see where this
suffereing of others and further my own growth when it affects my
heart, but what about them? it doesn't matter how much i ever
understand or do. there will still be huge and needless amounts of
suffering going on in the world, in america, down the street from me.
there's not an ending solution unless there's some peaceful state
people are in after they die.

ugh this path is confusing. it's great for me  (at least much of the
time) but it doesn't matter in the scheme of things if i'm looking at
the goal of the healing of the whole world.

quinton asked if it's worth it. who knows? it seems like suffereing
outweighs joy. and even ecstatic mystical joy and understanding and
pain and compassion and love and openness all mixed up doesn't atke
away the suffering of people who never have these experiences.

craig often says, "so now what?" i guess this is the question that's
worth asking, because otherwise we just sit in our heads and struggle
forever and never do anything. now what? this allows for creativity
and action, but allows me to continue to struggle and think about this
stuff. so if the whole world can't be healed, i can. and those in my
circle of influence, or some of them, can. but still...it doesn't
necessarily seem worth it.

so...central question for now for me is...."if there is no point, and
things are going to happen and change anyway, then what's the point?"
haha that's kind of circular, huh?!!!!

pain, love, beauty, grief, loss, endless combinations of these,
understanding, compassion, depression, pointlessness, purpose, life
life life.
life is change.
change.
change.
change.
unknowns and future pains and current pains and past pains and all of
it together and we all die and it doesn't matter. but i can't killeveryone or accept that this would be the right thing even if i came
to it as the right thing, because i'm not the only person out there.
so we just keep on living and hurting and loving and changing and then
the next people will too, until they die. and maybe we'll all die and
then there won't be anymore humans here. and i'll never know the
answers to these questions...hmmm reminds me of rilke.

openness,
avery

Subj:   [Minnows] Journal Erik 10-31-07 

Well, I found a new way to study. I have 2 quizzes and 2 exams this week and
it is really taking its toll on me. The thing that helps is however, deep
probing and resting. Working deeply and intuitively for an hour or two then
taking a break when my mind needs to clear and sort. I am actually amazed at
how much more effective this is. I can actually study and remember 4
subjects in one night rather than remember one or two really well and forget
the rest. It merely requires a new mindset each time I study. I think each
subject has its own ideal mindset. I have a physics, organic, and cal III
mindset to use (the Cal one developed only tonight- just ask the person who
saw me coming down the stairs :). My mind is in a study track right now.
That and multiple points of view are on my mind. When I want to really look
at something, I look at multiple viewpoints. As I was telling someone from
my physics class. I think their are mindsets for each discipline and sub
discipline and etc. The fun part is using the mindset of one discipline
(psychology) in another unrelated discipline (organic chemistry). I wonder
if there is a limit to view points. I haven't see one yet. Heck, it seems
near impossible to hold even all the ones I know in my head at any one time
only two or three at a time?  Personal preferences and preferences still
shape the viewpoints I choose so just switching viewpoints does not
neccessarily remove my biases eithier. Just another thought to add to a
chain of thoughts, clique, unique, whatever that might be going somewhere,
or not.

Subject: The Canvas
To: mkkimbell21@gmail.com

The Canvas
I'm trying to rest my mind and fall to sleep, however I'm stuck in a long
train of thought in a mind that wont lay down. I was laying in bed and
somehow I invisioned myself being asked "what is the meaning of life" and I
began this strange response.

Some people may say life is a journey, a path, or even a game, however to
me, I see it as a canvass.

Every life born has the gift of a canvass,
a canvass that was here before you,
and will be here after you.
You didn't choose what canvass your given,
and you will not choose when your canvass will be taken.
And whither you like it or not,
there is a brush in your hand.
Some people will spend their entire lives staring at the brush in awe.
Some people will strike away without ceasing the moment they see it in their
hand.
Some people will cradle there brush not sure what to do with it.
Some people will hide their brush, in fear that they'll leave a mark that
will hurt their canvass.
Some people will debate wither the brush in their hand is even real.
Some people will just stand with the brush in their hand and think nothing
of it if they drop it.
But there is a brush in your hand,
and it is you and only you that controlls its strokes.

You may choose its colors, you may choose its shapes, you may choose its
purpose.
You can constantly fill it with all the colors of the world.
You can paint it with the blackest black or the whitest white
You can throw paint paint everywhere your canvass has space.
You can simply keep your strokes small and concentrated.
You can carefully choose every move, where every stroke has its purpose
You can throw your arm wildly for no reason at all.
You can choose to make a beautifull painting.
You can choose to make a ink blob.And when your done, you may paint over it again.
You can always add more paint, but you can never take back a single stroke.
You may discover that you never had one painting.

Truthfully you had many strokes, many paintings.
One on top of the other, always changing with every stroke.
However whatever you choose to do,
you will quickly discover there is more then your small square of a canvass.

You may believe you have one small canvass that is yours and yours only.
But the truth is your sharing one single canvass, with many brushes.
The only thing you truly own is your own brush.
You may can paint your own paintings,
but you will never find an unmarked place.
every stroke you ever make will simply be over another.
a stroke now forever buried in the past,
from a brush that will never be here to paint it again.

Some people will run and cover every piece of the canvass they come too with
their brush.
Some people will fight that paintings from long past be protected.
Some people will hate the canvass and cover their sections with black.
Others will be fear full of other's paintings and run to cover theirs with
black.
Some will work to carefully restore and bring back life to destroyed
paintings.
Some will ask that brushes of different abilities and skills come together.
To come together and paint one single beautifully painting across the entire
canvass.
Some will analyze the paintings of past to look for purpose.
Some will analyze the paintings and claim they see patterns and the future.
Many will be curious as to what paintings could possibly lay buried beneath
the paint.
Even more will ask why is this canvass here and who made it.
And some will raise their voice and tell others how their brushes should be
used.
Many will compete against each other for who can make the best painting.
The purpose of many will be to spend their entire time on the canvas
fully devoted to becoming the best painter.

However no one can ever agree, and no one really knows whats best.
Every brush is unique, every stroke is unique.
What is best is perpetually debated, argued, and fought over.
Some brushes will group together and say, that their art is better then the
others
They will condemn, mock, or even destroy any art outside of theirs.
Some brushes will paint their entire lives never knowing why they paint
They will never question the reason for the canvass, the reason for the
paint.

Maby its fear, maby its ignorance, maby its apathy.
Their paintings are not theirs, they are the paintings of others.
They will come to the canvass, and they will leave the canvass,
never truly knowing the power behind every stroke of theirs.
Paintings will vary from area to area,
Many brushes will become accustomed to the places of their first paintings.
and the paintings that first gave them inspiration.
Others will fell they need to leave for the art of their beginning was not
for them.
Some will return with passion,
The rest will travel on their own journey

And what is important to realize is the canvass changes everyday.
The canvass was never like it was yesterday,
And no one knows what colors it will experience tomorrow,
You may paint all you like,
but in time you will ever painted will be painted over.
The canvass only exists as it exists now.
A brush may appear to be alone, to be different, to be unique.
And in truth every brush is alone, and different, and unique.
But every stroke is a stroke on top of a stroke,
All paint ever laid is always touching each other.
The only paint truly alone is the wet paint still on the brush.
Desperately wanting to be laid, to be added to the giant painting.

It's odd that the pondering death has come to you in *this* way:
pondering suicide. I ponder death sometimes in a metaphysical way, an
ontological way, and a Zen acceptance way. There is some deep
intuition that suicide is a serious injustice to the world, which I
care about so much. There are a lot of people to help in my lifetime,
I don't think I'll run out. Every time I get down on seeing how
desperate things are, all the injustice and ignorance, someone who
cares and is working shows up and my spirit is reinvigorated. I would
like to say that I could keep on going in the worst of situations
imaginable, but there are probably some cases where I would see
suicide as acceptable. Then again, the more I'm aware of my vast
creativity and solidity, that seems so far away I can't imagine such a
cenario. I guess, I can hold that suicide is not an absolute no-no for
me, but I feel so strongly in this place that it would 1. be off the
Path (huge dissonance) 2. steal a great source of knowledge, wisdom,
energy, compassion, etc. from the world 3. serve as a symbol, or
precedent for any of those who might have looked up to me, or justused my example to follow (e.g. my little brother, later in life
maybe, a student or someone who has read my books). The case I try to
picture when suicide might be ok for me is like being in a Nazi
concentration camp, knowing (somehow) that I am scheduled to die a
very uncomfortable death. Or some torture situation, kidnapped by a
Hannibal Lector, etc. I try to imagine still being a source of
solidity in the lives of the people around me, someone who supports
and helps others through the suffering. As I hear grotesque stories in
the news I wonder how I'd respond to a true violent psychopath.

When I said it was strange that your musings about death came in the
form of suicide, I mean the mine never really come this way, but as
you might have seen, from murder or some other freak accident. Those
are the ways I feel death the closest now. I probably won't die of
"old age" this week, but I may be hit by a car while trying to cross
Willow on my bike at night in the rain. I'm always afraid of drunk
drivers if I'm coming back from the lab late. I know there are a lot
here in Cookeville and I know they are doing their best not to get
caught by the cops, not to avoid hitting hypothetical bikers.

I have to get back to work, so I'm ending it there. See how your
disciplines prevent you from going downhill, Scott? I think that's
awesome. I didn't know about your secret until just last semester.
Disciplines keep you solid and prevent you from going too far down in
a hole, and give you a structure for recovery. I have a number of them
lined up with certain windows of almost absolute flexibility which
comprimises to keep me sane as well. Balance!

BTW, what is death to you? What does it mean, what process do you see
there? Do you have a judgment on the experience? What has death meant
to you in the past? Who have you known to die? And how has that shaped
your views?

Love!

You know, how death is a part of the meta-process, you die without death, that sort of thing (it's all in my mind, and you can't tack words on it). I've thought about it enough to where I'm not sure I'm afraid of doing it anymore. I think there's still a little fear about dying, and also about how I'd hurt a bunch of the people around me for doing it.

It makes me wonder endlessly what i do wrong, do i come off to strong, to desperate, to crazy? I don't know. I was hoping for some input from others on this last question... 

So, I have  theory that anyone can get anyone** they want-- and when I say "get" I don't necessarily mean marriage or it's a 100% match. I mean able to provoke an interest in the other person.  This of course is not always a good thing. And you must know your limits as well as theirs.  

Secret # 1:  Confidence. 
Confidence. Confidence. Confidence.  If you walk into a room with a confidence that radiates through your body, through your gate, through your eyes and the rest of your face, people notice.  Shoulder back, head up, clear and alert eyes. This does not have to be a "I'm so amazing and so much better than you" confidence but rather a quiet confidence.  If someone has confidence in the way they act, talk, walk, move the hair out of their eyes, it all plays someone's "Could I marry this person?" card. ("Could I marry this person card?" is not just a view into marriage, but also could this person protect me, provide for me, and complete me in ways that I can not complete myself, a balance.)  

If you lack a little confidence now-- Fake it till you make it.

Secret # 2:  Approachability: Looks aren't everything, but they are something.
No one has the front of the magazine perfection everyone  finds attractive.  But everyone can improve their look to a degree.  I'm definitely not saying plastic surgery, but I am saying PRIDE.  Have pride in your body. Have pride in your skin. Have pride in you. No, it is not fair that someone's first impression of you will be the first 5-15 seconds of seeing what you look like and how you speak and carry yourself, but that is where society is at.  Take pride in being well groomed and smelling nice.  No one is saying change your style or go into debt to be something you're not.  No way!  Keep your style. Keep yourself. But be approachable. 

Secret # 3: Flattery will get you everywhere.
Do give genuine compliments. Compliments do not always have to be in the form of "Oh, cool. I like your shoes."  You can also flatter someone by asking for their help on a project or for their opinion when deciding on something to write or paint or do research on if have an idea of their interests.  If you have your heart set on painting a holocaust picture with skeletons and the girl you interested in really likes puppies and flowers-- maybe you shouldn't ask about painting and just skip right to "I was thinking about getting my mother some flowers, what would you suggest."  

Secret # 4: Interests-- you have many.
I know when someone asks me what I enjoy doing after work, school, etc I say this "Uhh, umm... I clean a lot. I watch tv.  Sometimes I go a little rock climbing.  Back at school we played a lot of board games!"  Ok, now that I have successfully proven that I am super-duper lame... I'll continue.  Cleaning, tv and random board games aren't my only interest- just convenient activities.   Everyone has a million different interest. When Mr or Ms Potential starts talking about their love of bowling, show some interest with "Oh, really? I'm pretty good myself."  or if you suck "Oh, really? I'm terrible. I watched the Flintstones a lot growing up and had a constant fear of getting my fingers stuck in the ball! [insert small laugh and smile]".  If someone says they love to wakeboard or fish or ski, maybe mention how much you love the lake or love summer...or how you wish you knew how to do any of those.  Once again, I want to repeat this-- I'm NOT saying be someone you are not, but DO open yourself up to other people.  Maybe you're the best rock climber out there but have just never had a real opportunity to try. I have many friends that play a lot of video games (I meet a lot of people with that same interest). I don't go "Ugh, nerd" or something else degrading of their interest. I'll bring up how "back in the day" I played a lot of Zelda or how I loved super mario as a kid.  

Secret # 5: Make eye contact. Small smile. Break eye contact. Make eye contact.
Eye contact is important.  Window's to the soul-- maybe not.  Too much eye contact can be worse that too little eye contact.  You do not want to be that creepy kid who doesn't break eye contact.  When appropriate make eye contact, smile, break eye contact for 2 or 3 seconds, then make eye contact again for another 2 or 3 seconds.  Small smiles work wonders too.  I read somewhere that you can actually "trick" the mind into thinking its in love by the amount of eye contact you make with a person.  Be careful with that.  

Secret # 6: It's a MARATHON, not the 200-meter dash
Sometimes people meet and something sparks, and they discover they are long lost best friends that never met before now.... Yeah, not very often.  You are trying to build trust, build loyalty, create empathy/sympathy, create a friendship.  When meeting someone new, your goal should not be "I'm going to make that person fall in love with me" but rather the goal of "I'd really like to be their friend".  Become friends and show interest, but don't get clingy.  Don't blurt everything out.  After being around someone for two days, don't bring up that one time you OD on pain killers or how you cried for days after Skippy, your pet dog, died last summer.  Emotions are good, but to be honest, you don't want to be a "whiny boy" because the girl has only known you for 2 weeks.  That kills the confidence. 

The best advice I can give is to be your best.  If you are not happy that you drink like a fish and smoke like a chimney (happy when being completely honest with yourself) then change. What makes you think that someone else is going to like those habits too (and if they do, do you really want to be with them?).  Be your best. Try to find someone that pushes you to be more than your current best.  If you are not happy with your haibts, your acts; don't expect someone else to be.  Don't enter a relationship with the intent to find someone to love you unconditionally, so that you may return (or never leave) your bad habits.  They do not deserve that and neither do you.  Be the best you, you can be. 

Of course, when building a real, true relationship and making real connections look at interest, morals, values, determination, where that person wants to be in 10 years, etc.  These are just some pointers to get a conversation going and running.  

Also I enjoy a good sense of humor and someone that is humble. 
And don't be put down if "the one" gets away. They probably weren't that to begin with.  


**I really believe someone can get anyone they want-- as long as that person is not married or in a committed relationship all ready.  Those people are OFF LIMITS!

Craig mentions boundaries.
Boundaries.

In an idealistic state--
there are no boundaries.

Love is love. And we are bound to nothing while being bound to everything.
Maybe love is the immense capacity to feel.
Maybe love defines itself.

We are imperfect and not living in an idealistic world.

I have always enjoyed the story about the monk traveling through the woods
and coming across a deep hole. In the hole he hears two cries- one from a
tiger and one from her cub. They're starving. Without thinking he jumps intothe hole. The tigers devour him. Perhaps this is extreme, but at the same
time throwing himself to the tigers was the most useful his life could be at
that moment.
If at a different moment his purpose, his usefulness would have been defined
as something else.

I do believe love redefines itself with every stage, every moment. It is not
absolute.

The meeting tonight was just plain awesome. I loved the personal sharing
that occurred. Add pain and issues to the pot, stir well, and make one batch
of caring and love. Now to boundaries.

My boundaries are the sharpest when it comes to emotional pain. I have
strong boundaries (of the neurotic type) to try and protect myself from
pain. The pain I fear most is pain that comes from rejection. I find that
pain to be intolerable. It just reminds me too much of the way things used
to be. My boundaries here are highly neurotic and general cause all sorts of
counterproductive behavior. I notice that mainly it causes a strange tension
between myself and another person and generally results in one way
conversations were either myself or the other person does all of the
talking. When I have to do the talking, I feel that the relationship is
forced and fake that I am only maintaining it for my own benefit. That is
how I have often felt with my early friends. In fact, almost all of my
friends before Mentor. I had to force a relationship as no one would be my
friend otherwise. Well, no one I would let be my friend. My perfectionism
killed me there. I have to have friends who I saw as "better" than me or
they wouldn't remain my friends for long. I had to have someone to look up
to. I purposefully put myself in the powerless position that way I would not
have to be responsible or brave. I would not have to take charge or be under
pressure. Power is the major boundary here. If I feel powerless, my controls
kick in hard to rectify the situation, sometimes violently. I have more than
once physically attacked my sister when she belittled me. Not in several
years, and I'm not proud of it. My anger would just carry me away. The lack
of control and power outside my family made me demand it in my family. If I
don't deal with this, I think I could really hurt someone in a marriage or
position of power. To be honest, despite what I think, I would be easily
tempted by power. Without mentor, I would have gone power mad if I ever
gained power that my Ego could not deny. In each longing for power there isa cry for help. Help for pain that never healed. A lack of power that is
really felt. A lack of control. I seek control and power to prevent more
pain. I figure that more defenses mean less pain, and I haven't found the
courage to accept the pain on a deep level so I seek control to offset the
pain to a level I can take. I go as far as to repress my emotions to avoid
feeling the pain. The Anima guards the chest.

You saw the anger in both of you , then saw your part in keeping it alive,
and then did what was needed to change it (name it, claim it, tame it).
Simply Beautiful Scott.


Yet there is a difference between knowing about it and being there. And
> really you can't know about it without being there.


It always turns out somewhat different than we thought, doesn't it?  From
the inside of a place we have a different view as much as we would like to
think we can understand completely from the outside looking in.  On the
first day of Brit Lit Connie likes to say "Be a little humble about what you
think you know."  I have never received better advice than that.

But what was I doing if I wasn't working through Perry 5? I most certainly> cared about what I was thinking about, not like Perry 5 at all.  Yet I'm not

>
> I think Perry has never really been an all inclusive description of our
work.  It is possible to work on a huge range of concepts from any point on
Perry.  Morality, Divinity, Reality, all of these things.  Perry is a
measure of how much you externalize this process.  So while it doesn't
affect what you think about, it says a little bit about the manner in which
you think and process.  Also caring about how you think is a first step not
a last step, take heart!

Coming into Perry 5 without a context for it or thought for the other side
can make it suck, but you have spent plenty of time playing with a larger
picture.  This can ease the process significantly, taking universal for all
time wtf angst and making it a personal for now feeling.  This is why we
teach Perry!! Huzzah!!



> My Perry 5 is when I accepted the meaninglessness and stopped caring,
> period.


You spent a good deal of time with it all figured out,  a concept of Perry
down to the last detail.  You cared about this picture, you loved it, and
you wanted it to be perfect.  When you let go of that attachment you were
free to just be where you needed to be.  It is freeing and terrifying.  The
future is uncertain when we let ourselves float along down the river but the
alternative is clinging to our stones, in which case we will certainly sink.


We have been rooting for you, Scott.

Fare Forward Traveler,
Craig

This was in response to

I'm through, for now, with being down in the dumps about emptiness. This is a pretty cool thing, to be free and open without care for my own projections.
Just now, I invited my stepfather to join us coming to Cookeville so that he could eat with us at Beetovin's Bistro. He sounded really shocked. You see, every time I've moved back to Cookeville, he never came. It never occurred to me that it was because he thought I didn't want him to go. Well, maybe it did, because I really didn't want him to go. I didn't want to listen to him criticize me for something.
But when I got home from work today, and I was climbing the stairs, I was imagining another dialogue with Kent. I said to Kent, "you know, the anger we have for each other is really meaningless. I'm tired of carrying this weight around for nothing. Why don't we just drop the anger? It's pointless."
Then as a spur of the moment thing, I called up the stairs to their room, saying hi, whussup, and would Kent like to come to Cookeville to eat at Beethovin's Bistro?
He said he would definitely try to work it into his schedule (the man has a schedule for Sunday. Wow).

I never thought Perry 5 could be so good! The way it was always protrayed to me was eternal despair all the time. I thought it was going to suck.
But you know, it's only been about a week of complete despair. "Woah is me."

...So now what? I guess I should try commiting to something.
But I feel like I already know how it goes. Yet there is a difference between knowing about it and being there. And really you can't know about it without being there.
I wonder about "breaking the cycle" like I had talked about a while back.
But what was I doing if I wasn't working through Perry 5? I most certainly cared about what I was thinking about, not like Perry 5 at all.
Yet I'm not saying anything about how "oh, my god. No absolutes to the universe." I already knew that, with incredible paradoxical complexity of levels upon levels, didn't I? The paradoxes were slowly working through my head, letting go of me.
What I had to realize was that caring was my biggest impediment to caring.
When I stopped caring, there went a week by of blackness, where junk was being rearranged in my head, maybe.
So it leads me to wonder then, just what is Perry 5?
You can't say "meaninglessness", because that in itself has meaning. You can't say "no absolutes", because that also conveys an absolute.
I think that it's different for everyone. My coming into Mentor as an agnostic had a profound impact on my dealing with absolutes, throwing me quickly in paradoxes, but still keeping me with the "frame of mind" of someone at Perry 4.
So my Perry 5 is not a matter of being uncertain, or of having no absolutes (although I've been through that feeling about five to six times along with a continuous spiral downward that lasted for several monthes). My Perry 5 is when I accepted the meaninglessness and stopped caring, period.
"Just let go. Just let go...          We just had a near-life experience."~Tyler Durden.
Oh, man.

Well, I like this. I like how free I've become. And even though I'm going to be throwing myself back into the shit when school starts, back to Peer Mentoring and doing shit, it's both going to be harder and easier to do all of this work, harder because there is no purpose, easier because I don't care about it. I still hate doing this work because it's rules, ISTJ's, secrataries, bureacracies, and I'd much rather do nothing than this meaningless shit where there is no "call to serve."
It's hard to stand on your own feet, especially when you don't have a "call to serve" to lean upon.
I don't give a fuck about Peer Mentoring. However, because I don't care, I strangely end up caring about people. They're people, not freshmen, not students, not future-engineers, not Americans, just people like me. I care about them.
People.
Peer Mentoring means nothing, but I'm doing it. I don't need to do it, but I'm doing it. I don't want to do it, but I'm doing it. I don't care if people want me to do this or not. It's still a wasted motion.
I still think Mentor is a wasted motion, journaling, meditating, going to meetings, talking about deep stuff, working through issues, are all wasted motions. It's all stupid and pointless.
Yet I'm doing it anyway.As wasted motion as it all is, most of it is fun. And some is not, like meditating, but I do it anyway.

Now I'm just yak, yak, yaking.

Good night.

love,
Scott

MHB wisdom chapter **underconstruction**  

Jon Jones

here is where I want to go with the chapter.
 
 
 
"Where is the Life we have lost in living?
Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?"
                                    - T.S. Eliot
 
What is wisdom? What does the word "wisdom" mean? Where are the wise sages and their teachings? To many, wisdom is an indefinable yet invaluable quality that seems to be just beyond succinct description. Some note psychologists, such as Dr. Robert Sternberg and others, have said that one needs a certain level of wisdom to identify and understand wisdom. Furthermore, some believe there is a prerequisite level of knowledge or intelligence needed either to decode the meaning of a wise assertion or to see the potential wisdom in a statement. Can wisdom be taught? The answer may at best be, yes and no. It is perhaps more easily conveyed through an analogy about a well kept and robust garden. In the Garden of wisdom there are kernels of insight and seeds of knowledge. The water could be considered as experience and the soil as the mind with its intelligence and predisposition to novelty. Lastly, we could imagine the sun as patience and think of it as representing the cyclic nature of many aspects of personal growth. 
 
            However, we've still not reached a true definition or even understanding of the many meanings and manifestations of wisdom. The analogy is reasonable for starting out, but there is a form of wisdom in knowing the boundaries between multidimensional reality and multifaceted symbolism / metaphor. Is wisdom a way of thinking? Is it a way or method of reasoning, discerning, decision making, or structuring thoughts? Is it the way one prioritizes aspects or actions according to some moral or ethical principle? Is it a way of knowing, objectively or subjectively, the truest nature of things? Is it a way of knowing the most efficient or most practical things and courses of action? Is wisdom the aggregate accretion of esoteric knowledge or truth, long ago discovered and closely guarded? Is wisdom a way of being? Is it a state of being? Is it a state of mind or a state of development? Is it part of a larger process of development? Is it the final stage or the beginning of a whole other paradigm and ontology? Is all wisdom created equal? Is it all the same wisdom or are there many kinds of wisdom? 
 
            The word "wisdom" is very much like many other English words in that it is composed of letters, has an etymology,   has separate definitions depending on context, and is a referent (not the thing itself but a symbolic representation of the thing. As a word and a concept, wisdom and its variety of meanings is subject to change. If one wants to solve a mystery, they follow the clues. If one wants to define wisdom, then one must follow the word in its denotations and connotations through the ages. Above all else, the most important aspect of the search must be context. Definitions come from specific contexts, and hence the OED's incredibly large etymologies. Wisdom is perhaps also analogous to a tree, having large dendrite-like branchings fanning out according to time, place, meaning, and use. 
 
            As we track wisdom through the ages we see a move from a single wisdom into a more diversified pair that expand upon the original grouping of knowledge, sayings, beliefs, and prudent actions held together under the banner of "good (if not best) things to do and ways to live). There are then two main branches of wisdom in the ancient societies beginning about 5,000 BCE. These branches are what I call Practical Wisdom and Divine Wisdom. The delineation is as follows. 
 
[insert citations and proff of what I'm saying]
 
            Practical wisdom came to encompass and perhaps spur the development of such ideas and structures as cultural conventions, societal beliefs about the way the world worked, conventional wisdom about society and environment. Divine wisdom, on the other hand, seems to have been integrated with if not developed out of the teachings of early religion and mythology. Such things as truth from religions revelation, transcendental experiences, paradoxical observations, mystical meanings, and introspective thought in relation to the world and life and death seem to have all come from a related set of experience and thinking. 
 
            We must remember that wisdom is much like a family tree. Wisdom and its associated words belonged to these cultures and were in daily use by the people. It grew and changed with the people as they used these concepts and explored them, creating a more divers spectrum of ideas, heuristics, and ways of acting. Volitional, affective, intellectual. And so, wisdom has come to reflect their beliefs as well as their priorities in the writings that remain.

Craig:
Mentor is a program of training for the mind. Training is a bit different from what we may normal associate with traditional education. A normal course may have an informative title and a syllabus that lists what the student will be expected to know by the end. In class students are given lectures and demonstrations a set of knowledge and skills which are to be reinforced by homework. Later, testing seeks to confirm that a student can adequately repeat what the teacher has presented in class. Memorization and regurgitation is often the surest way of passing in this system which is developed in order to shove mass quantities of data through variously shaped holes.
Our initial introduction to the concept of training often comes to us through our bodies rather than our minds. We believe that we study new things to fill our minds, but we train to expand the ability of our bodies. So while the mind is treated as an entity of minimal flexibility, the body is taught to always exceed its limitations. If we can crawl we push ourselves to walk. It isn't a chore, it's a delight. We see everyone around us walking and so it is less a question of if but rather when. **Perhaps when adults are not around babies ponder their failures and philosophize about whether or not people should walk, but if so they deal poorly with peer pressure and resume their attempts in the presence of the walking class.** Running follows quickly long before walking is mastered. A little later in life we may return to running but from a very different perspective. 
Our goal now is not to learn how to run, but how to run better. In the pursuit of this goal a coach will challenge us to look at running from all new directs. If we want to master the skill running we have to master other parts of our body that are interconnected with it. We learn to warm up and stretch. We run at various distances and at various speeds. We run on track, grass, and sand. We study nutrition and learn how to best fuel our body. We learn new ways to breath. We learn to watch ourselves and recognize what our body is communicating to our mind. With experience we can accurately name the state of our body. The general label of tired may be further broken down into feeling sleepy, out of breath, or dehydrated. With familiarity we can identify pain and know when to stop or when to push through. Each little thing builds off the others to make a healthy body and then a mature athlete. Each basic part of the whole is examined and revisited many times as flaws are examined and form is improved. The body is changed in its ability as new movements are practiced to the point that they become habit. This process is called training, and it is most productive with a committed trainee and an experienced instructor.
How is this relevant to our minds?
********
The word meditation covers a wide range of ideas and disciplines spanning ancient cultures, world religions, and modern science. A parishioner counting beads and chanting prayers, a monk seated quietly with legs crossed in lotus, and a student of the martial arts moving through careful routine can all accurately claim to practice meditation. Despite their differences each form shares some commonality in its basic goals and challenges.

No matter the meditation of choice, the initial task is to develop focus. Focus is the ability of directed attention. It is taken for granted that we control our thoughts, but the first few seconds of trying to really be still reveals how limited our control of attention actually is. 

A common theme of meditation is dealing with distraction and choosing when and where to focus our minds. Mastery of distraction is invaluable. If distraction cannot sway us from our path then each line of thought we take is a choice. When something new comes into our attention we can then decide if it is worth time now, later, or not at all. Although simple in concept, actually mastering focus requires commitment and discipline. Furthermore, because focus and distraction are so basic to how we interact with our world, improving in this area changes the quality of everything we do.

Everywhere we go pictures, slogans, and music fight for limited space in our mind. Flashy advertising is designed to pull us out of our previous thoughts and hold on. When we sit down to study and our minds wander and we lose focus. Our reading slows down, retention suffers, and we may miss important details. 
Our concern is a practice called just sitting. 
To start find a sitting position that is relatively comfortable. While a traditional lotus position may look impressive it will be more of a distraction than aid without a certain amount of flexibility. A cross legged position or simply sitting on the edge of a chair will serve just as well. The important thing is to sit with your back straight, shoulders back and head level. This will keep you windpipe open, and preempt the general drowsiness that can accompany a slouched posture.
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth in a deep and steady manner. A good breath can be felt down in your gut, expanding your stomach rather than your chest. A few deep breathes in a straight posture will have an immediate affect on your brain and body. At the start of your meditation they also serve as a marker point. With these breathes we drop what ever else has been on our mind and refocus on our meditation here and now. As you progress your breath will reduce in volume as your mind slows down and your body requires less oxygen. A slight tingling in your lips may indicate hyperventilation, a condition where your body is taking in too much oxygen. This is a sign that you can further reduce your air intake.
For now close your eyes and visualize a white disk. Then let it grow bigger until it fills your field. As thoughts, feelings, and distractions arise simply notice them and gently let them pass out of your mind. 
…meditation is very much like training a puppy. You put the puppy down and say "Stay," Does the puppy listen? It gets up and it runs away. You sit the puppy back down again. "Stay." And the puppy runs away over and over again. Sometimes the puppy jumps up, runs over, and pees in the corner or makes some other mess. Our minds are much the same as the puppy, only they create even bigger messes. In training the mind, or the puppy, we have to start over and over again.
…frustration comes with the territory. Nothing in our culture or our schooling has taught us to steady and calm our attention. One psychologist has called us a society of attentional spastics. Finding it difficult to concentrate, many people respond by forcing their attention on their breath or mantra or prayer with tense irritation and self-judgment, or worse. Is this the way you would train a puppy? Does it really help to beat it? Concentration is never a matter of force or coercion. You simply pick up the puppy again and return to reconnect with the here and now. 
-Jack Kornfield
. Start by doing this for periods of 5 minutes a few times a day and work up to doing at least 20 minutes once a day. It will be difficult at first, which is why we are doing it.

would you please go ahead adn put in the other chapters that we have
palnned to write on now so we know they are to be done? then we can see
what else we need to add.

everyone, please treat the chapt. headings as places to dump quotes, blurbs
from journals [ great use of eric's journal!!], whatever seems useful. ti's
better to haev too much stuff than too little. we will go through my
notebooks at one meeting this fall and seee what we want to add from them.

scott, cool chapt./ on being cool. now that list you made needs to be
discussed, right? why don't you work on that instnead of focusing on how
empty you feel? dco some work that will help other people! go back through
your notebook of journals [scott and enyone else] and find examples of
perry 2, 5, etc., and pull them and dump them in appropriate chapts. work
on comments or writing little paragraphs to stimulate others who are
working on different chapts. but i like your prose style, scott. you write
very well. ;)

qw, i qill send you more stuff to dump in chapts when you send me the
expanded outline wiht al the chapoters we have planned so far...  and it
woudl help all of us if you put the names of hte people who are suppose dto
be working on a chapt. at teh head next to th title of the chapt., wiht a
chair or person in charge of organizing each chapt. material not4ed like:
craig [chair], scott, etc.

then we can send material to that person to go in that chapt.

every0one, don't worry about sending stuff that is imperfect or not
finished. get it in and  we can work on it. this is a group effort. we will
invite the grads to help out too, but after you guys have your say and work
first.

working on my stuff in teh interstices...

MENTOR
Gender: Masculine

Usage: Greek Mythology

Other Scripts: Μεντωρ (Ancient Greek)

Possibly related to Greek μενος (menos) ཁspiritཁ. In Greek legend Mentor was the son of Alkimos. When Odysseus left to fight in the Trojan War he entrusted Mentor with the care of his palace and the guardianship of his son Telemachos. When the goddess Athena visited Telemachos she took the guise of Mentor.

The following are my thoughts outloud. If it comes off as arrogant, keep in mind that I'm from New York. I'm directing my thoughts at anyone. They are just little gems that are sitting in the palm of my hand, and right now I am observing them.
Also note, that I have used no exclamation marks or smiley faces in this journal, I feel I am marveling in another way.

True knowledge doesn't come from experience. One may experience something and gain nothing.
It doesn't come from authorities. They could harp all day, and he may know nothing.
It doesn't come from solitude and meditation. You could do this your whole life, and not know anything.
It isn't a result, but you must work to obtain it.
You must know, in order to know, and to do that requires that you give up knowing.
If you can see the path, then walking it would no problem at all. But we are blind men, only able to feel with our feet and hands, often left to stumble about, but crawling forward on all fours none-the-less. I say, since we don't have eyes, stop trying to see. Use your hands, and become good at feeling the ground. Then it is as though you don't know what it means to be blind.
Feel the here and now of all this. Be present, and walking this path slowly and cautiously may still be difficult, tedious, and time-consuming work, but you walk it anyway.
Thus you give up knowing so you can know, in order to know. See?
In Mentor, we have gathered a handful of really amazing people. Humans were born with the tools, but I believe few people know how to use them. We are learning how, so that we can teach them: these are your eyes, use them to see, these are your hands, what you feel is the ground, etc.
I'm speaking so terribly in metaphor, but it's a convenient way to get my thoughts off my chest and onto the journal.

The purpose of Mentor was described to me as "to unbrainwash you."
I believe that's step one.
After you wake up, you've got to learn to see and how to walk and navigate. It's the metaphor of the bird. First it hatches from it's egg, but is it done? It needs to eat, be taken care of. It's got to grow feathers. All along it looks about at the sky and the ground, awake and attentive to its surroundings, but you've got to be patient. Don't fly until you've got the feathers and the muscles.
So I believe step two is training the mind to do all of the things it was meant to do. You've got to exercise the mind, diet the mind, stretch it, rest it, feed it, and repeat, while all along remaining patient. Eventually, when we're strong enough, I believe it will happen all its own.

We can learn so much from nature. Connie finally clued me in on how to garden in her garden, and I had to be mindful of all the lessons that every small thing I did had for me. When clearing out weeds, for example, is like doing shadow work on the mind. How sometimes you can juggle too many things at once when you try to wrap your arms around a bale of dead stuff. And that doing this kind of mental training is long, hard, and tedious work, but the garden (your mind/the universe) is thankful to you, and you are thankful to it (gratitude again).
One only needs to look at nature to find the appropriate wisdom for anything we do. That show "Kung Fu" is pretty illustrative of that, I believe.

Actually, I believe there are many eggs we need to hatch from. Perhaps we shouldn't call them god boxes, but god eggs. We must hatch so many times before we are attentive and awake. There are eggs for every major issue in our lives, and we sleep comfortably inside of them. If we could only hatch from these eggs, which is what I believe waking up is, we could grow stronger with better tools in order to tackle the bigger, stronger egg shells that protect us.
I've got birds on the brain, since I can hear them chirping next to my open window every morning.
Learn from nature the wisdom that will nurture us.

love,
Scott
