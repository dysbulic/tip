<h1>Mentor</h1>
<p>Goal: to give students the tools/skills they need to become productive, autonomous, well-adjusted members of society—living in harmony with themselves and the world.</p>
<p>Mentor is a growth process that helps its members with personal development. At the same time Mentor itself is growing and changing. Its goals and underlying framework remain largely the same, but its methodology is constantly evolving.</p>

<h1>Framework of Mentor</h1>
<p>Mentor pushes students towards its basic goal by helping them develop skills in the following, interdependent categories:</p>

<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Self-reflectiveness</li>
  <li>Critical and Creative Thinking</li>
  <li>Integrating and Contextualizing Information</li>
  <li>Autonomy/Self-Discipline</li>
  <li>Commitment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interpersonal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Communication/Collaboration</li>
  <li>Teaching/Leadership</li>
  <li>Recognition and Appreciation of human differences.</li>
</ul>

<p>The program can be tailored by mentors and members towards students individual needs, to either a more Vocational or more Personal Growth and Development curriculum. However, the underlying structure for either approach is the same. As such, most students working toward either end will progress towards the other as well.</p>

<h2>Skills Development</h2>
<p>Mentor student skill development progresses in three main contexts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Individual. In Mentor and then Self directed study.</li>
  <li>Group. As observers and then full participants. With a Mentor and then a Peer Mentor.</li>
  <li>Leaders. Under mentor guidance (or co-leading) and then on their own.</li>
</ol>

<p>Mentor students may initially (but not always, mentor students are always doing things their own way), progress through these contexts linearly. However, they eventually learn to operate in all three contexts simultaneously.</p>

<p>In each of these contexts (usually) mentor students will, at first, operate under the direction of a mentor (peer or otherwise, but usually not peer initially). They will eventually work under their own direction—moving towards one of mentor’s goals, Autonomy.</p>

<p><em>What is happening in each context?</em></p>

<h3>Individual</h3>
<ol>
  <li>One-on-One conferences with a Mentor.</li>
  <li>Journaling.</li>
  <li>Other exercises tailored to individual needs, moving towards developing the skills listed previously.</li>
</ol>

<p>At fist the student will work with a mentor on the skills necessary for participating in the groups below, with a focus on journaling, which as an integral part of the whole program. Students with trust/openness issues will work on building trust and openness with a single individual (the mentor) here.</p>

<h3>Group</h3>
<p>As soon as the mentor/mentor student feel that the student will be comfortable (or in some cases, be able to tolerate) a group setting, the student will particpate and interact in smaller groups and then larger groups as the student gains confidence in themselves and trust and openness with others. This context consists of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Group meetings and Discussions.</li>
  <li>Reading qnd reacting to other group members journals.</li>
  <li>Making ones own journals available to other group members (when the student feels they are ready).</li>
  <li>Group exercises.</li>
</ol>

<p>Students will often start as mere observers and then evolve into full participants. Some people need to take smaller steps than others.</p>

<p>Initially groups will be Mentor directed, but will ideally shift into student maintained groups.</p>

<h3>Leaders</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, Mentor students will eventually come to lead their own groups. At first (generally) students will operate under the guidance of a Mentor or co-lead with a mentor. Eventually the mentor will step away from a position of authority within the group altogether. Ideally, students will operate and maintain their own groups entirely—creating and running their own groups as needed without any mentor direction at all.</p>

<p>During this time in mentor groups, students are encouraged to find, join, lead and create groups outside of mentor—in the university, surrounding community, and in the world.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>This is the most dynamic part of Mentor. There will be many common or similar exercises for all individuals, groups, and leaders, but many will have to be tailored to the students individual needs. Exercises will cover these topics:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Critical thinking</li>
  <li>Values clarification.</li>
  <li>Trust, honesty, and openness.</li>
  <li>Team exercises.</li>
  <li>Self-esteem exercises.</li>
  <li>Vocational Exercises.</li>
  <li>Any other exercises which meet the needs of the students.</li>
</ol>
