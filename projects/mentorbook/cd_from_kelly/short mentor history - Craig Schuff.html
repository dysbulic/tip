<h1>Short Mentor History</h1>
<h2>Craig Schuff</h2>
<h2>Draft #1</h2>

<p>If a parent asks what is mentor...</p>

<p>I ask beginning mentor students not to tell their parents about Mentor, and if parents are concerned and ask questions, it adds more unnecessary hassle for me. But during and after my role as Honors Program director, I tell minnows to say that mentor is like a philosophical book club, with readings and discussions. Dr. Hood has won 5 national teaching awards and the university teaching award twice, largely for her work with this program. The student has a great opportunity that most people do not get.</p>

<p>What I tell students Mentor is...</p>

<h2>Short History</h2>

<p>The origins of Mentor are, like most human effort, complex and murky. Two strands of my rather multifacited life came together during my undergraduate years at Converse College (1959-63): helping suicidal, brutally depressed, and abused peers, and teaching and tutoring peers in a wide variety of needs. I never planned to be a teacher; I was terrified of standing up in front of any group. If a teacher required an oral project, I would drop the course.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, looking back at my childhood I had been leading and teaching in many circumstances all along.</p>

<p>While I did not have a mentor at Converse who was like me now, or even one that meet my deep needs, I did have several important mentors who shaped parts of my life. Before Converse, a retired Oxford don who became chair of math at Wofford College across town, mentored me in the Oxford tradition. He saw me as a math genius and put me to reading topology, Landau's Foundation of Analysis, and whitehead and Russel's Principia during my senior of high school and the following summer. He wanted me to access a deep, intuitive knowing about how math works, deeper than numbers and formulas. I sorta got a handle on what he wanted, but I was too fearful of change and did not understand the workings of the mind, so while I intuited glimmerings of what he was trying to teach me, I never had the big epiphany I was longing for.</p>

<p>He did not have a vocabulary of models of the mind as tools to help me grasp what he was trying to teach. But his gentle, Zen-like approach as stayed with me. Years later I had that epiphany and could use that intuitive approach to try to teach math and physics majors I was mentoring. And I saw how that profound level of understanding of these elemental relationships is Profoundly beyond words. One is forced to create a vocabulary, a system, in order to talk about them all.</p>

<hr />

<p>At St. Conile and the others schools in St. Louis, I worked with mentor students in small groups on intellectual topics. It was the late 60's and we were caught up in the political and revolutionary forces of change. Passionate, committed, and informed, we discussed the political and ecological issues of the time.</p>

<p>In 1968, our first year in St. Louis, SLU was having its sesquicentennial celebration,: they invited top theologians from all the major religions to come there to give lectures and courses in theology and ecumenism. I was like a theological groupie, following them around asking questions, reading their books, stretching their mind. But the most important of the for me was Karl Rahner, who engineered the Vatican II reforms.</p>

<p>When we came to TTU in 1972, I taught freshman English part-time, as an adjunct, played with our four year-old, supported my husband and tried to work with him on his emotional issues and his Yeats book, kept a half-acre organic vegetable garden, read omnivorously, cleaned house 3 times a week, and joined 23 clubs.</p>

<p>The English department chair expected, no, demanded, that adjuncts teach the syllabus we were given by the department. I complained to him that almost everyone in my English 101 and 102 classes was working at levels well below competency levels the syllabus demanded. He shrugged and said, &quot;Flunk them all.&quot; He really believed in Darwinian survival of the fittest; I always felt this was particularly strange in a Church of Christ minister.</p>

<p>I couldn't bear the hopelessness and pain for the students and for me of teaching material well above their competence, so I set up study classes to teach the elementary grammar they needed. I was teaching five sections of freshman, and so many of them wanted to do the remedial work that I had to create five two-hour study sessions, each meeting three times a week. Thus I had 95 contact hours each quarter.</p>

<p>Of course bibliotherapy began to play a part in teaching the whole student. I found that I couldn't teach just grammar. Everything I taught I seemed to relate to my life, to wholeness.</p>

<p>Mentor groups at TTU really evolved from teaching the 57/7 class, first as comparative literature and then as POPC. These were the mavericks, rebels, out-of-the-box thinkers. Many of them were high IQ (maybe say many were very intellectually gifted). I taught John Wade and Lynn Mathes in one of those classes. Bob and Karl Schumaker drove me crazy in another. I had small groups of Mentor students working on specific books or intellectual topics, meeting with me once a week.</p>

<p>I also created the science fiction club which was eventually name Alpha Psi Phi, during that first year; I was horrified to learn that a technological university did not already have such a club; to bridge the humanities and science and technology.</p>

<p>While I had the occasional mentor student from my Brit Lit 201 class or from Kelly's classes, almost all the regular students seemed &quot;dead,&quot; unable to think, to question, to read outside class requirements. So my hope, my challenge and for the fun for me all came from the class of 67 and the out-of-class-mentor discussion group.</p>

<p>At UTK I taught only one year. My regular freshman class was brain dead, not a reader or thinker among them.</p>
