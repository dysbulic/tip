The entire object of true education is to make people not merely do
the right things, but to enjoy them; not merely industrious, but love
to industry; not merely learned, but to love knowledge; not merely
pure, but to love purity; not merely just, but to hunger and thirst
after justice.

                                  --John Ruskin
