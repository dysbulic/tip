The Honors Council at Marshall University just completed a mission
statement during an evaluation of its Honors Program. In light of some
recent conversations on the list, it might be of some interest.

                The mission of the Honors Program is:

-to offer an enhanced educational experience to academically talented and
    highly motivated students;
-to design, in collaboration with faculty recognized for excellence
    in teaching, an innovative, interdisciplinary, and multidisciplinary
    curriculum that emphasizes critical thinking, communications skills,
    and collaborative learning;
-to supplement that curriculum with enriched academic opportunities
    consisting of outside lectures, field work, or course-related travel.

To this end, students participating in the Honors Program will:

-develop confidence in their abilities to understand and discuss complex
    ideas and texts, as well as to engage in problem solving and research
    design;
-learn to apply this new knowledge in meaningful ways that will help them
    succeed in their professional and personal lives following college;
    strengthen their written and oral communication skills;
-master an ability to work effectively in groups of diverse people;
-make connections between disciplines;
-enjoy a range of supplemental experiences of an academic and social nature
    with similarly motivated and talented students.
