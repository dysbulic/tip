hmmm lets cast the memory way back  :)

Spring 96 - small group, 5 guys, totem style; Progoff
Fall 96   - I think we started Cor then; I led my small group
Spring 97 - continued w/ Cor; Progoff; my small group
Fall 97  - Cor continued
Spring 98 - Cor continued; Progoff weekend
Fall 98 - I think we did small groups that you assigned
Spring 99 - not sure. book groups were going on but i wasnt in one

hope this helps
