Something to Think About

 By Forest Felling

If we could shrink the Earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all existing human ratios remaining the same, it would
look like this:

There would be 57 Asians, 21 Europeans, 14 from the   Americas (North and
  South) and 8 Africans.
51 would be female; 49 would be male.
70 would be nonwhite; 30 white.
70 would be non-Christian; 30 Christian.
50% of the entire world's wealth would be in the hands of only 6 people
  and all 6 would be citizens of the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing.
70 would be unable to read.
50 would suffer from malnutrition.
1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth.
Only 1 would have a college education.
No one would own a computer.

When one considers our world from such an incredibly compressed
perspective, the need for both tolerance and understanding becomes
glaringly apparent...
The longer I study and ponder these statistics, the more I realize how
grateful I should be for the place, time and circumstances of my
birth.

( I'm not sure if Mr. Felling's statistics are accurate but the
concept is fascinating.)
