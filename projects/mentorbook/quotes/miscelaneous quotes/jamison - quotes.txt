Subj: quotes from AN UNQUIET MIND

hey, y'all...
i read this book.. uh... a while ago.  i actually sent these quotes when
i read the book, but some of you are new, and they've been banging
around in my head.  so - forgive me, and hit delete, if they're a rerun.
  again, some chuckles... the author is an MD shrink, i think - if i
remember correctly, also author of TOUCHED WITH FIRE, a book about
bipolar disorder and musicians/ artists/poets...

quotes from AN UNQUIET MIND by Kay Redfield Jamison

"My eyes were open, but my brain was swaying gently in its hammock,
tucked away in the far back reaches of my skull. It was dark and stuffy
in the room, but beautiful and snowing outside. A group of my colleagues
and I were in the Colorado Rockies, and anyone with any sense at all was
skiing; yet there were more than a hundred doctors in the room, and the
slides were going click, click, click. I caught myself thinking, for the
hundredth time, that being crazy doesn't necessarily mean being stupid,
and what on earth was I doing indoors instead of being out on the
slopes?"

"He was kind enough to call creative that which some, no doubt, would
have called psychotic. It was my first lesson in appreciating the
complicated, permeable boundaries between bizarre and original thought,
and I remain deeply indebted to him for the intellectual tolerance that
cast a positive rather than pathological hue over what I had written."

"Unlike classes - which seemed stifling and, like the rest of the
world's schedules, based on an assumption of steadiness and consistency
in moods and performance - the research life allowed an independence and
flexiblity of schedule that I found exhilarating. University
administrators do not consider the pronounced seasonal changes in
behaviors and abilities that are part and parcel of the lives of most
manic-depressives."

"I decided early in graduate school that I needed to do something about
my moods. It quickly came down to a choice between seeing a psychiatrist
or buying a horse. Since almost everyone I knew was seeing a
psychiatrist, and since I had an absolute belief that I should be able
to handle my own problems, I naturally bought a horse. Not just any
horse, but an unrelentingly stubborn and blindingly neurotic one, a sort
of equine Woody Allen, but without the entertainment value. I had
imagined, of course, a MY FRIEND FLICKA scenario: my horse would see me
in the distance, wiggle his ears in eager anticipation, whinny with
pleasure, canter up to my side, and nuzzle my breeches for sugar or
carrots. What I got instead was a wildly anxious, frequently lame, and
not terribly bright creature who was terrified of snakes, people,
lizards, dogs, and other horses - in short, terrified of anything that
he might reasonably be expected to encounter in life - thus causing him
to rear up on his hind legs and bolt madly about in completely random
directions. In the clouds-and-silver-linings department, however,
whenever I rode him I was generally too terrified to be depressed, and
when I was manic I had no judgement anyway, so maniacal riding was well
suited to the mood. Unfortunately, it was not only a crazy decision to
buy a horse, it was also stupid. I may as well have saved myself the
trouble of cashing my Public Health Service fellowship checks, and fed
him the checks directly: besides shoeing him and bording him - with
veterinary requirements that he supplement his regular diet with a kind
of horsey granola that cost more than a good pear brandy - I also had to
buy him special orthopedic shoes to correct, or occasionally correct,
his ongoing problems with lameness. These shoes left Gucci and
Neiman-Marcus in the dust, and, after a painfully acquired but profound
understanding of why people shoot horse traders, and horses, I had to
acknowledge that I was a graduate student, not Dr. Dolittle; more to the
point, I was neither a Mellon nor a Rockefeller. I sold my horse, as one
passes along the queen of spades, and started showing up for my classes
at UCLA."

"Qualifying examinations came and went; I conducted a completely
uninspired doctoral study about heroin addiction and wrote a
correspondingly uninspired disseration based upon it; then after two
weeks of frantically cramming every bit of trivia that I could into my
brain, I walked into a room filled with five unsmiling men seated around
a table, sat down, and went through the ordeal that is politely known as
a Final Oral Examination, or, more aptly, in a military sense, the
defense of one's dissertation. Two of the men at the table were the
profesors with whom I had worked for years; one of them was easy on me,
the other was - I suppose in an attempt to demonstrate impartiality -
unrelenting. One of the three psychopharmacologists, the only one
without tenure, felt compelled to give me a particularly bad time, but
the other two, who were full professors, clearly felt he had gone too
far in establishing his mastery of the minutia of statistics and
research design and eventually forced him to return to a less
Rottweilerian level of general civility. After three hours of the
intricate intellectual ballet that constituted the defense of my thesis,
I left the room and stood in the hallway while they voted; endured the
requisite moments of agony; and returned to find the same five men
who,hours earlier, had seemed so grim and unfriendly. But this time they
were smiling; their hands were outstretched to shake mine; and they all
said, to my vast relief and pleasure, Congratulations.

The rites of passage in the academic world are arcane and,in their own
way, highly romantic, and the tensions and unpleasantries of
dissertations and final oral examinations are quickly forgotten in the
wonderful moments of the sherry afterward, admission into a very old
club, parties of celebration, doctoral gowns, academic rituals, and
hearing for the first time "Dr.," rather than "Miss," Jamison. I was
hired as an assistant professor in the UCLA Department of Psychiatry,
got good parking for the first time in my life, joined the faculty club
posthaste, and began to work my way up the academic food chain."

"I was beginning to tire of all the opportunities to build character at
the expense of peace, predictablilty, and a normal life."

"Tenure is the closest thing to a blood sport that first- class
universities can offer: it is intensely competitive, all-consuming,
exciting, fast, rather brutal, and very male."

"Named for his smooth and slithery essence, the Oyster was a senior
professor: he was patronizing, smug, and had all of the intellectual and
emotional complexity of, as one might expect, a small mollusk. He
thought of women in terms of breasts, not minds, and it always seemed to
irritate him that most women had both."

"No amount of love can cure madness or unblacken one's dark moods. Love
can help, it can make the pain more tolerable, but, always, one is
beholden to medicatiino that may or may not always work and may or may
not be bearable. Madness, on the other hand, most certainly can and
often does kill love through its mistrustfulness, unrelenting pessimism,
discontents, erratic behavior, and especially, through its savage
moods."

"There is a thin line between what is considered zany and what is
thought to be - a ghastly but damning word -"inappropriate," and only a
sliverish gap exists betweenthought intense, or a bit volatile, and
being dismissively labeled "unstable." And, for whatever reasons of
personal vanity, I dread the fact that my suicide attempt and
depressions will be seen by some as acts of weakness or as "neurotic."
Somehow, I don't mind the thought of being seen as intermittently
psychotic nearly as much as I mind being pigeonholed as weak and
neurotic."

"There was a time when I honestly believed that there was only a certain
amount of pain one had to go through in life. Because manic-depressive
illness had brought such misery and uncertainty in its wake, I presumed
life should therefore be kinder to me in other, more balancing ways. But
then I also had believed that I could fly through starfields and slide
along the rings of Saturn. Perhaps my judgement left something to be
desired."
