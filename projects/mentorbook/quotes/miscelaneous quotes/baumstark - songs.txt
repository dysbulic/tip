Lord, here comes the flood
We'll say goodbye to flesh and blood
If again the seas are silent
in any still alive
It'll be those who gave their island to survive
Drink up, dreamers, you're running dry.

 --Peter Gabriel, _Here Comes the Flood_

he said "I came here to watch the sun
disappear into the ocean
it's been years since I smelled the salty sea.
he turned his bottle up and down
and I saw him lost
and I saw him found
he said "I don't know what I've been lookin' for,
maybe me..."

You live you learn
You love you learn
You cry you learn
You lose you learn
You bleed you learn
You scream you learn

What about love? It's Defective!  It's always breaking in half
What about sex? It's Defective!  It's never built to really last
What about your family? It's Defective!  All the batteries are shot
What about your friends? They're Defective!  All the parts are out of stock
What about hope? It's Defective!  It's corroded and decayed
What about faith? It's Defective!  It's tattered and it's frayed
What about your Gods? They're Defective!  They forgot the warranty
What about your town? It's Defective! It's a dead end street to me
What about your school? It's Defective! It's a pack of useless lies
What about your work? It's Defective! It's a crock and then you die
What about your childhood? It's Defective! It's dead and buried in the past
What about your future? It's Defective! And you can shove it up your ass!

Who am I? Why am I here?
Forget the questions! Someone gimme another beer!
What's the meaning of life?
What's the meaning of it all?
You gotta learn to dance before you learn to crawl!
You gotta learn to dance before you learn to crawl!

 --Jim Steinmann/Meatloaf, _Everything Louder than Everything Else_

I have faith in medication
I believe in the Prozac nation
You play doctor but I've lost patience
This is where it ends
This is where it ends

But all of these horses
You chase around
In the end they are the ones
That always bring you down

To love another person is to see the face of God.

 --from Les Miserables (the musical, not the book :)

When I was born, they looked at me and said
"What a good boy, what a smart boy, what a strong boy."
And when you were born, they looked at you and said
"What a good girl, what a smart girl, what a pretty girl."
We've got these chains that hang around our necks
People want to strangle us with them, before we take our first steps

 --Barenaked Ladies, _What a Good Boy_

We were looking for ourselves and found each other
In the Car
We groped for excuses not to be alone anymore
In the Car
We were waiting for our lives to start their endings
In the Car
We were never making love
We were never making love
We were never making love

 --Barenaked Ladies, _In the Car_

I wish you would step out from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in

One man's fear is another man's truth

You're gonna have to go and find it
You'll have to dig beneath the ground
You'll have to unearth every ugly stone that kept you on your own
And simply put them down
You're gonna have to look around

 --Blues Traveler, _Look Around_

***

These are the days
You might fill with laughter until you break
These days
You might feel a shaft of light make its way across your face
And when you do
You'll know how it was meant to be
See the signs and know their meaning
It's true
You'll know how it was meant to be
See the signs and know they're speaking
To you
To you

 --10,000 Maniacs, _These Are Days_
