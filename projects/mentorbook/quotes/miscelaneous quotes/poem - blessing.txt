And God gave me Difficulties to make me strong.

I asked for Wisdom.........
And God gave me Problems to solve.

I asked for Prosperity.........
And God gave me Brain and Brawn to work.

I asked for Courage.........
And God gave me Danger to overcome.

I asked for Love.........
And God gave me Troubled people to help.

I asked for Favors.........

May God Bless You
May God Bless you with unspeakable joy, not only
in the world to come, but  in this world also.

May your path be bright and full of light
everywhere you go.

May God tell darkness that it must flee
at your command.

And, I pray your feet will never stumble
out of God's plan.

May the desires of your heart come true,
And may you experience Peace in everything you do.
May Goodness, Kindness, and Mercy come your way.
And, may you gain Wisdom and grow
in the Lord everyday.
