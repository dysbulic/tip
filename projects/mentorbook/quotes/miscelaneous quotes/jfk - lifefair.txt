President John Kennedy said, "There is always inequity in life. Some
men are killed in a war and some men are wounded, and some men never
leave the country, and some men are stationed in the Antarctic and
some are stationed in San Francisco. It's very hard in military or in
personal life to assure complete equality. Life is unfair."
