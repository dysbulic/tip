Greetings - in honor of  Einstein being chosen man of the century, here are
Some words of wisdom. More from me later, enjoy...

                Albert Einstein Quotes

On Knowledge
 - "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and
    more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage
    -- to move in the opposite direction."
 - "Imagination is more important than knowledge."
 - "The only real valuable thing is intuition."
 - "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."
 - "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age
    eighteen."
 - "The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources."
 - "The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education."
 - "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own
    reason for existing."

His Understanding of the World:
 - "I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details."
 - "The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax."
 - "I am convinced that He (God) does not play dice."
 - "The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility."
 - "Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character."
 - "Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind."
 - "Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by
    understanding."
 - "The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is
    comprehensible."
 - "Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and
    I'm not sure about the the universe."
 - "Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and
    Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods."
 - "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but
    World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."
 - "In order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must,
    above all, be a sheep."
 - "Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can
    be counted counts." (Sign hanging in Einstein's office at Princeton)

On People and Life:
 - "Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one."
 - "A person starts to live when he can live outside himself."
 - "I never think of the future. It comes soon enough."
 - "Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing."
 - "Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new."
 - "Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak
    minds."
 - "Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love."
 - "No, this trick won't work...How on earth are you ever going to
    explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a
    biological phenomenon as first love?"
 - "My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable
    superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we
    are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind."
 - "The release of atom power has changed everything except our way
    of thinking...the solution to this problem lies in the heart of
    mankind. If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker."
 - "Great spirits have always found violent opposition from
    mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does
    not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly
    and courageously uses his intelligence."
 - "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.
    It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom
    this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder
    and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed."
 - "Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of
    me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics,
    know that the distinction between past, present, and future is
    only a stubbornly persistent illusion."
 - "You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat.
    You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los
    Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly
    the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there.
    The only difference is that there is no cat."
 - "A human being is a part of a whole, called by us _universe_,
    a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his
    thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest...
    a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion
    is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal
    desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.
    Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening
    our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and
    the whole of nature in its beauty."

On Math and Science and Education:
 - "Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's
    living at it."
 - "God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He
    integrates empirically."
 - "The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday
    thinking."
 - "Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological
    criminal."
 - "We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used
    when we created them."
 - "Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he
    learned in school."
 - "Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure
    you mine are still greater."
 - "Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the
    present, but an equation is something for eternity."
 - "If A is a success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z.
     Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut."
 - "As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not
    certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."
 - "Yes, we have to divide up our time like that, between our politics
    and our equations. But to me our equations are far more important,
    for politics are only a matter of present concern. A mathematical
    equation stands forever."
 - "...one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science
     is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless
    dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A
    finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into
    the world of objective perception and thought."
 - "Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour.
    Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute.
    THAT'S relativity."
