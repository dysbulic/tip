Mystic in America 1999

If I was new to the study of Mystical Experiences...
If I have an affinity to mystical spiritual experiences...
and I live in the USA...
What would the listers suggest in the way of:
1. Books
2. Living examples
3. "No longer amongst us" examples
4. Living a spiritual life
5. Living a meaningful life
6. Psychology and Mystical Life (I am a Graduate Student in counseling
Psychology)
7. Illusions on the Path and other "dead ends"
8. Mistakes and learning experiences that you might like to share.
9. Using the Mystic-L list as a collective cyber-mentorship
10. Mystical Frontiers for the 21st Century
11.  Personal challenges
12.  Meaning of Life
13.  Love

Just a few areas I'd like to open up for discussion.
