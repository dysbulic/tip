Hello
I was looking for a stream
unpolluted by reasons and views
for a lamp
unshuttered by religion
for a bright, still being
who is simply normal
without personality
or ambition of any kind.

I was hoping to find
a lord with no laws
a guide with no followers
a teacher who says nothing at all.

I'll know the one I seek
by the sign of love
the only word that could ever speak
to this ancient flame that lives in my heart.

I have no interest
in any of these explanations
of the cosmos and its workings

nor do I care
about any of these practices
these ladders for climbers

I have only wanted
to sit unmarked in your midst
like a soft-headed child
swollen with faith and love
