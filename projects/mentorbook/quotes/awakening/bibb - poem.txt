Explode!
Pour out until there's nothing left but Love.
When that's done, keep pouring,
Flowing in grace and light.
One atom has enough energy to power a house;
You have more atoms than there are people in the world!

Sacrifice.
Leave everything behind -
Attachment, need, want -
Until only Desire remains.
Then sacrifice Desire, and find Truth.

Burn.
Dwelling in flame, let the fire purify you,
Leaving only Self.
Then Self burns away.
Nothing is left, only space.
Watch as Love, Desire, Truth, and Self return,
Filling this space, overfilling it.
They spill out, surrounding and caressing others.
Their journey and their return have transformed them,
Purified them.
See how they touch others;
They are irresistible, flame to a moth.
Holding nothing, touch everything.
Explode!


I wrote this during the "letter to myself" section at Search last
October. It sums up pretty well where I was then - I was just slipping
into that ??? experience I had at closing mass, where I opened up
[heh, closing mass, opening up]. The co-directors held these for a few
months, then mailed them back to the Searchers and team members last
spring. I have been avoiding typing this in to send out because
frankly, I'm a little embarassed at how gushy it was.

Actually, today was the first time I've read it in its entirety since
I wrote it; in it, I was talking about a lot of stuff I really don't
understand. I think that it's pretty well-written (except for the atom
lines at the beginning), and that the ideas in it are good, but I
really don't know what I was talking about :) I mean, *know*.

But here it is; all in all, I think it's rather good.  I hope that you get
something out of it :)

Love,
Aaron
