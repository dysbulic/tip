Subj: J:  Why do mentor, working on boundaries and probably more...

      Something I've been meaning to write for a while is an
explanation of why I do mentor stuff.  The more I think about it, the
more succinct the answer becomes.  I just like it...My life is more
fulfilling when I do mentor-type stuff.  That stuff, for me right now
is just trying to be aware and expand myself.  I journal to let others
know what I'm doing and to get stuff out of my head, I do yoga because
I like to, I read and think about books because they interest me, I
make attempts at helping other people because I want to.  At first I
did all that because I thought I had to or was in competition with
other mentor students, that wore off eventually, though and I didn't
do anything.  Eventually I realized that it sucked not to be doing all
this stuff and so I started doing it again, only this time because I
want to.  It isn't really a matter of "what are others getting out of
it and is that something I want," but simply that it is something I
want to do for what I have gotten out of it in the past and what I
expect to get out of it in the future.
