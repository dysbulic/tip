Subj: purpose of the book that I am reading


I just finished the first chapter of the book that I was mentioning
earlier, A Rhetoric of Interpersonal Communication and Relationships,
and the first chapter, which is an introductory one, ends like this:

"Our task in this book is to assist you in understanding and
developing the kind of relationships advocated in the gestalt
"prayer."

                           I do my thing
                       and you do your thing
                     I am not in this world to
                          live up to your
                         expectations, and
                     you are not in this world
                        to live up to mine.
                       You are you and I am I
                        and if by chance we
                          find each other
                          it's beautiful.

                           (Perls, 1976)
