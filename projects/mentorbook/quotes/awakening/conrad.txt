Over the weekend the following quote came to me:

"It's extraordinary how we go through life with eyes half shut, with
dull ears, with dormant thoughts. Perhaps it is just as well; and it
may be that it is this very dullness that makes life to the
incalculable majority so supportable and so welcome. Nevertheless,
there can be but few of us who had never known one of these rare
moments of awakening when we see, hear, understand ever so much-
everything- in a flash- before we fall back again into our agreeable
somnolence."

 -Joseph Conrad, Lord Jim
