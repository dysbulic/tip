THE QUEST

Into the silent night I cried;
"Who am I?"
The answer came softly, like an almost forgotten memory;
"To know who you are,
you must first know what you are!"
What am I?
The question rolled like thunder in a stormy sky;
What am I?
I began to seek an answer.

I went into the forest and asked a tree.
I became the tree, and knew patience.
I went into the storm and asked the wind.
I became the wind, and knew freedom.
I went into the morning after the storm and asked the new snow.
I became the snow, and knew purity.
I went to the waterfall and asked the water.
I became the water, and knew life.
I went to the hilltop and asked the sun.
I became the sun, and knew love.
I went to the meadow and asked a flower.
I became the flower, and knew purpose.
I looked up and asked the stars.
Then I knew.

Suddenly, my cry reverberates through an empty cathedral;
Who am I?
The answer returns as a faint echo from beyond the limits of time;
"I am you, I am us, I am everything."
"I am all that is, all that was, all that will be,
and all that never can be."

In the emptiness, the truth thunders
like tears of rain on the cathedral roof -
There is nothing other than me!
A thousand million times I must ask the same question.
A thousand million times I must search again for myself.
A thousand million times I must find myself -
yet always the search continues,
through the hallways of time.
Can there ever be another me?

Out of the solitude, a light appears, at first distant, faintly beckoning.
As I draw near, a star-candle ignites my heart.
In a passionate blaze of love I can finally see.
Now I can see you, and you, and you  - - and us.
The quest is finished.
 Now I know who I am.
