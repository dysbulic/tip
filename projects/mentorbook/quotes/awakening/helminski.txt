One day the heart may reach such contact with its own source through
merging directly with the Creative Power and knowing the One behind
multiplicity that it may make a home in unity.  Human beings are destined
to realize this possibility more and more.  The result iis the complete
human being, the drop that becomes the Sea.  It is not difficult to
achieve this end, because we are made for it.

--Kabir Edmund Helminski, _Living Presence: A Sufi Way to Mindfulness &
the Essential Self_
