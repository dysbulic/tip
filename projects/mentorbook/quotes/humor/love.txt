TORCH SONG TRILOGY by Harvey Fierstein



"The next time you feel you have to say 'I love you' to someone, say it =
to yourself and see if you believe it!"=20

"Whaddya mean, 'Why?' Why does anyone love anyone? Because I did. =
Because...I did. Because...he let me."



L: "I know that from the start you loved Ed more than he loved you.."=20

A: "He told you that?"

L: "It's nothing to be ashamed of."

A: "Of course not. If it's true that one person always loves more than =
the other, why not be one who feels the most?"



"And so, I became a hustler. I figured I needed the affection more than =
they needed the money."

"He says that you're a self-centered, insensitive, boring fool who =
wouldn't know love if it wore wings, a diaper, and shot heart-shaped =
arrows at your butt."

"With friends like her, who needs newspapers?"

"I have enough trouble with the 'What nows' without starting in on the =
'What ifs.'"

"We always kept an open line of communication, that is, until my father =
died; then, I don't know, something happened, she clammed up. I mean, we =
saw each other more than ever, and we spoke daily on the phone, but =
somehow we managed to say less than ever. It became a contest to see who =
could talk most but say least."

"It's not the telling that frightens me. But I shake when I think of the =
long-muzzled floodgates of motherly advice that will unleash when she =
gets wind of this."

"Happened? What could possibly have happened? My mother walked through =
that door and within three minutes managed to insult the plane ride, the =
bus ride, Women's Lib, the apartment, Manhattan, my personal hygiene, =
sense of humor, afghan, smoking, stenciling, and cockroaches."

"Did you say 'oops'? No, Ed. 'Oops' is for when you fall down an =
elevator shaft. 'Oops' is when you skinny-dip in a school of piranha. =
'Oops' is for accidentally douching with Drano. No, Ed, this was not an =
'oops.' This was a {strangled scream}!"

".. mother went to my room, and I sat in the bathroom making =
toilet-paper flowers and flushing them down the drain. Three hours I =
flowered and flushed, flowered and flushed, til, thank God, I ran out of =
paper. Forced from my Autumn Beige Tiled retreat, I called a truce for =
lunch. It was eaten in silence. No one even chewed. (You ever gum down a =
hamburger?)"

"You want an intelligent conversation? Do what I do: Talk to yourself. =
It's the only way."

"Seems no matter how many petitions they sign, they just can't get God =
to raise the age of puberty to eighteen. Kids have sex."

D: "I'm simply suggesting you could both use a little TEN."

E: "T.E.N.?"

D: "Tension-Easing Nookie. Sex is very theraputic."

"This is the first time I've been seduced in the guise of preventive =
medicine."

"Never fish for compliments in polluted waters."

"The way she acts you'd think she and God went to school together."

"She thinks I hate her and everything she stands for. And I don't, for =
the life of me, know how to tell her that what I want more than anything =
is to have exactly the life she had. With a few minor alterations. My =
parents.. they were something together. In all the years they were =
married the only time they were separated was for the two days while my =
mother was in the hospital. And my father...he wouldn't even get into =
bed without her. He spent both nights on a chair in the living room. And =
the way they made my brother and me feel; like we were the smartest, =
handsomest, most talented, most important people in the world. Didn't =
matter what we did, good or bad, it was the best. And she thinks she did =
something wrong."

"No. They're very different. Alan loved all my faults: my temper, my =
bitchiness, my fat... He looked for faults to love. And Ed? Ed loves the =
rest. And really, who needs to be loved for their virtues? Anyway, it's =
easier to love someone who's dead; they make so few mistakes."

"Give yourself time, Arnold. It gets better. But, Arnold, it won't ever =
go away. You can work longer hours, adopt a son, fight with me... =
whatever, it'll still be there. But that's all right. It becomes part of =
you, like wearing a ring or a pair of glasses. You get used to it and =
it's good...because it makes sure you don't forget. You don't want to =
forget him, do you?"

"There's one more thing you've got to understand. You made fun of my =
crocheting before. You think it's a cute little effeminate thing I do. =
Let me tell you something; I have taught myself to sew, cook, fix =
plumbing, do taxes, build furnature...I can even pat myself on the back =
when necessary. All so I don't have to ask anyone for anything. There is =
nothing I need from anyone except love and respect. And anyone who can't =
give me those two things has no place in my life. {Breath} You are my =
mother, and I love you. I do. But if you can't respect me...then you've =
got no business being here."
