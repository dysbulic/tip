OREO PERSONALITY TEST

 Psychologists have discovered that the manner in which people eat Oreo
cookies provides great insight into their personalities. Choose which
method best describes your favorite method of eating Oreo's:

  1. The whole thing all at once.
  2. One bite at a time
  3. Slow and methodical nibbles examining the results of each bite
     afterwards.
  4. In little feverous nibbles.
  5. Dunked in some liquid (milk, coffee...).
  6. Twisted apart, the inside, then the cookie.
  7. Twisted apart, the inside, and toss the cookie.
  8. Just the cookie, not the inside.
  9. I just like to lick them, not eat them.
 10. I don't have a favorite way because I don't like Oreo.

 Your Personality:
  1. The whole thing... this means you consume life with
abandon, you are fun to be with, exciting, carefree with some hint of
recklessness.  You are totally irresponsible.  No one should trust you with
their children.

 2. One bite at a time... you are lucky to be one of the 5.4 billion other
people who eat their Oreo's this very same way.  Just like them, you lack
imagination, but that's ok, not to worry, you're normal.

  3. Slow and Methodical... You follow the rules. You're very tidy and
orderly.   You're very meticulous in every detail with every thing you do
to the point of being anal retentive and irritating to others.  Stay out of
the fast lane if  you're only going to go the speed limit.

 4. Feverous Nibbles... Your boss likes you because you get your work done
quickly. You always have a million things to do and never enough time to do
them. Mental break downs and suicides run in your family.  Valium and
Ritalin would do you good.

 5. Dunked... every one likes you because you are always upbeat.  You like
to sugar coat unpleasant experiences and rationalize bad situations in to
good ones.  You are in total denial about the shambles you call a life. You
have a propensity towards narcotic addiction.

 6. Twisted apart, the inside, and then the cookie...  you have a highly
curious nature. You take pleasure in breaking things apart to find out how
they work, though not always able to put them back together, so you destroy
all the evidence of your activities.  You deny your involvement when things
go wrong. You are a compulsive liar and exhibit deviant, if not criminal,
behavior.

 7. Twisted apart, the inside, and then toss the cookie... You are
good at business and take risks that pay off. You take what you want
and throw the rest away. You are greedy, selfish, mean, and lack
feelings for others. You should be ashamed of yourself. But that's ok,
you don't care, you got yours.

 8. Just the cookie, not the inside...  You enjoy pain.

 9. I just like to lick them, not eat them...  Stay away from small furry
animals and frogs and seek professional medical help - immediately.

 10. I don't have a favorite way, I don't like Oreo cookies... You
probably come from a rich family, and like to wear nice things, and go
to up-scale restaurants. You are particular and fussy about the things
you buy, own, and wear. Things have to be just right. You like to be
pampered. You are a prima donna. There's just no pleasing you.
