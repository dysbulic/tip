DAILY AFFIRMATION

As I let go of my shoulds and feelings of guilt, I can get in touch with
my inner Sociopath
- I assume full responsibility for my actions, except the ones that are
someone else's fault.
- I no longer need to punish, deceive or compromise myself. Unless, of
course, I want to stay employed.
- In some cultures what I do would be considered normal.
- Having control over myself is nearly as good as having control over
others.
- My intuition nearly makes up for my lack of good judgement.
- I honor my personality flaws, for without them I would have no
personality
at all.
- I am grateful that I am not as judgmental as all those censorious,
self-righteous people around me.
- I need not suffer in silence while I can still moan, whimper and
complain.
- As I learn the innermost secrets of the people around me, they reward me
in many ways to keep me quiet.
- When someone hurts me, forgiveness is cheaper than a lawsuit. But not
nearly as gratifying.
- The first step is to say nice things about myself. The second to do nice
things for myself. The third, to find someone to buy me nice things.
- As I learn to trust the universe, I no longer need to carry a gun.
- All of me is beautiful and valuable, even the ugly, stupid, and
disgusting
parts.
- I am at one with my duality.
- Only a lack of imagination saves me from immobilizing myself with
imaginary fears.
- I honor and express all facets of my being, regardless of state and local
laws.
- Today I will gladly share my experience and advice, for there are no
sweeter words than "I told you so."
- A good scapegoat is nearly as welcome as a solution to the problem.
- Just for today, I will not sit in my living room all day watching TV.
Instead I will move my TV into the bedroom.
- The complete lack of evidence is the surest sign that the conspiracy is
working.
- I am learning that criticism is not nearly as effective as sabotage.
- Becoming aware of my character defects leads me to the next step --
blaming my parents.
- I will find humor in my everyday life by looking for people I can laugh
at.
- To have a successful relationship I must learn to make it look like I'm
giving as much as I'm getting.
- I am willing to make the mistakes if someone else is willing to learn
from them.
