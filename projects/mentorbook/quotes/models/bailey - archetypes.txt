i found it kind of hard to take this either time, because the model became
pretty obvious.  from the pictures of each type (which starts out the
brocure section), i bet that we could figur eout how to get each response.
the four questions just scream to me the S/N and T/F scales.

from just looking at the pictures and not trying to build a model from the
questions (because that's boggling my mind right now), this is what i would
comeu p with.

clergy
benevolent ruler
sheperd
black knight
experimenter/scientist
explorer/navigator
accountant
scribe
worker
dreamer
white knight
healer

i was kind of hoping to score scribe just because of my connotations for
it, more T scores needed though for that.  if you want to take a quick look
at the pictures to see what you can come up with as interpretations it's at
this site:
