I.  A PERSONAL NOTE

This document, the Personality Type Summary (PTS for short), is truly
a labor of love. I originally wrote this for the distributors in my
network marketing business. My intent was to help them better relate
to themselves and to others by understanding the principles of
personality typing. Since that first version, the PTS has been greatly
modified and expanded, with contributions from many people. I do not
consider this document to be "the final version", and so I welcome any
and all feedback to improve it in all aspects. I especially would like
to firm up the Resource Materials section by adding more titles,
including some of the important articles from peer reviewed journals.

If you have access to Usenet, the 'BBS' of the Internet, I encourage
you to subscribe to the newsgroup 'alt.psychology.personality'. In
that newsgroup, all aspects of normal (not neurotic) human personality
are discussed. Well over 95% of all the discussion pertains to one
model of personality modeling, generically called 'personality
typing', which is the subject matter of this document. Thus the very
original and not too obvious name for this document, "Personality Type
Summary".

In addition, an extensive archive of personality-related files has
been established on the Internet, and these files can be retrieved via
anonymous ftp. If you're not sure your site has anonymous ftp access
to the Internet, then ask your system administrator. If you do, but
don't know how to use ftp, again ask your system administrator for
help. The site name is 'netcom.com', the directory path to the top of
the archive directory is /pub/noring/personality .

I hope you enjoy the wonderful world of personality typing as much as
I do. Give it a test drive. You may just find it: fun, challenging,
significant, and useful (quiz: why did I choose these four words? Find
out below!).

Oh, and have a great day (a typical NF closing).

III.  GENERAL INTRODUCTION

As we look at the people around us, we observe the great variety of
personality traits among them. As examples, some people are very
outgoing and fun-oriented, while others are more quiet and
introspective; some people are highly analytical in decision making,
while others use their feelings for deciding; some people feel more
comfortable living a planned, orderly life, while others prefer to
live spontaneously. Though the number of observed traits appears
finite (albeit large), the subtle and unique interaction between these
traits confidently leads us to the conclusion that every individual on
this planet is gifted with a truly unique personality.

Despite this conclusion, the question naturally arises: "Can we model,
at least approximately, human personality?" A related and even more
important question is: "If we can model human personality, does such a
model have any value or interest?"

To help answer these questions, let me cite an analogy. Physical
scientists are continually striving to improve the models (better
known as theories) of nature. It is by these theories, and only by
these theories, that human beings can attempt to understand and make
sense of what is observed. For example, physicists have developed
several theories (e.g., relativity, quantum mechanics,
electromagnetics, etc.) to explain particular phenomena. Because a
common link between all these theories has not yet been found despite
great effort (the elusive, almost quixotic Grand Unified Theory), many
physicists consider it probable these individual theories are
incomplete, being subsets of more complete, but as of yet
undiscovered, theories that can be linked together. Yet, despite their
probable incompleteness, physicists and engineers confidently apply
these theories to real world problems, with usually great success.

Though the above analogy of modeling the physical world does not
exactly apply to personality modeling, some of the underlying
principles do hold true. Many personality models have been developed
from the beginning of recorded history, each of them having their
strengths and shortcomings. No "true" model of human personality has
yet been developed, and it can be argued that human personality is
just too complex to ever be able to model perfectly. However, many of
the models that have been developed do seem to approximately and
reasonably model human personality, or at least some aspects of it, to
an accuracy that makes them useful and predictive. This last point,
admittedly, is one of current debate by psychologists and
non-psychologist alike (e.g., what is "reasonable accuracy?"; what is
"predictive"?; what is "useful"?).

So, assuming that we can model human personality with "reasonable
accuracy", what value would such a model have? I can see two values:
1) giving an individual a better understanding of themselves and thus
helping them to personally grow and to build self-esteem, and 2)
helping an individual understand and thus relate more effectively with
others - not only for their personal relationships such as with a
spouse and with close friends, but for other relationships as well,
such as co-workers.

Some people have personal, even emotional, difficulties with any kind
of personality modeling. As an example, one common and recurring
argument used against personality modeling is that it "puts people in
boxes" (this exact phrase, or a variant of it, is heard quite often).
On the surface this argument sounds good, but as you explore that
argument further, you generally find that it is really a statement
expressing either a fear that personality modeling can be misused or
abused (which it can, just like everything else in the world), or, a
feeling that personality modeling somehow devalues people, or, for a
few people, their ignorance combined with a neurotic level of
skepticism.

I would counter these underlying reasons by saying that personality
models do not put people in boxes, people put people in boxes - all
developers of modern personality models do acknowledge the
imperfections and limitations of their models and associated metrics,
and reasonably intelligent and responsible users heed these warnings.
Also, personality models do not devalue people. In reality they show
us the diversity of normal human personality which helps us to better
understand and appreciate others who are different from ourselves, and
to understand and accept people is to value them. This in itself is
sufficient reason to develop practical models of normal human
personality that can be used by all people, not only by psychologists.

============================================================================


IV.  INTRODUCTION TO PERSONALITY TYPING

As stated in the General Introduction, many personality models have
been developed. The personality model/system presented in this Summary
is the most well-known one in the world-at-large, generically called
"Personality Typing". Personality typing was first developed by Carl
Jung in the early 1920's. In its purest form, Jungian personality
typing is arguably the most complex view of human nature ever
described, and even today it is quite a task to attempt to understand
Jung's writings on personality (see the Resource Material section at
the end of this Summary for references to Jung's works).

Fortunately, in the 1950's, Myers and Briggs resurrected Jungian
personality typing, modified it somewhat by adding a fourth scale,
simplified its description, and developed a psychometric called the
MBTI, the "Myers- Briggs Type Indicator" for measuring their revised
system of personality typing. The MBTI test and associated model has
become so famous that today many people refer to personality typing as
the "MBTI", but in a rigorous sense this is not true; the MBTI is only
one test instrument among several for determining personality types,
though it is by far the most widely used. Hereafter, unless qualified,
'personality typing' refers to the personality model developed by
Myers and Briggs, and adapted by others such as Keirsey and Bates,
while the MBTI refers to their test.

In a somewhat oversimplified nutshell, personality typing as defined
by Myers and Briggs, and more recently by Keirsey and Bates and others
(I will not even attempt to explain Jung's view of personality
typing), essentially assumes that much of our personality can be
defined by dividing it into four orthogonal (or independent)
preference areas or scales: energizing, attending, deciding, and
living (defined in detail below). Within each scale we have a
preference for one of two opposites that define the scale (also
described below). This makes for a total of 16 different combinations
(2x2x2x2), each of which defines one particular and unique personality
archetype.*

-----
*Here's where Jungian thought comes into play since particular
combinations of preferences can have profound effects on overall
personality by interacting in quite complex and dynamic ways, even
though the preference scales themselves appear to be independent of
one another in a practical sense. (Some minor correlation has
sometimes been observed in the preference scales. From a practical
viewpoint, however, the four scales can be considered orthogonal).
-----

It is a curious and interesting observation that personality typing is
not used nor studied much within the research/academic psychological
and psychiatric communities, at least compared to other
models/metrics, nor is it universally accepted. Some reasons for this
are that, first of all, personality typing is automatically rejected
by some schools of thought on purely philosophical grounds (e.g.,
cognitive psychology, social psychology); it would not matter to many
of the proponents of these schools of thought whether or not
personality typing was shown to work in the real world! These people
tend to focus more on scientific purity/orthodoxy than on
"engineering" practicality. (Both of these "world views" of science
and its application are equally valid and important.)

The second reason is more pragmatic: personality typing does not
measure mental health since it assumes that all preferences and types
are equally normal and healthy. Thus, many therapists who are treating
mental illness do not usually find it useful for their purposes
since they almost always need to understand the mental health of their
patient and so they tend to use other psychometrics, such as the MMPI,
which are specifically designed for this purpose. However, this
doesn't mean that practicing psychologists totally eschew personality
typing - some do use this system for their patients/ clients,
particularly for helping people to "find themselves" and for other
non-mental health related purposes such as marriage and career
counseling. In addition, counselors find that their clients can
quickly understand this model, and the many lay-oriented books on the
subject of personality typing are a great aid to understanding, thus
augmenting the efforts of the counselor.

Outside of the psychological community, however, personality typing
(with the MBTI being the most used metric) is by far the most
widely-used model of human personality. It is used extensively in
career counseling and development, business and education. Its
penetration into these areas stems partly from the fact cited above
that it does not touch upon the tricky aspect of mental health, which
is better dealt with by trained counseling psychologists and
psychiatrists.

Personality typing also assumes that all types, preferences, and
temperaments are equally valid and good, which fosters an appreciation
rather than a mistrust of diversity. This, combined with its
"intuitive" credibility, makes personality typing very popular.

For those who take a more scientific approach to personality, let me
make four final comments (and if you quickly get bored by the
following deeper discussion you can skip to the next section).

First of all, many researchers in personality typing believe that
other independent scales could be added to the four to more accurately
model human personality, and they are probably correct. However, this
is an area that has not been well researched. To many, the four
Myers-Briggs scales appear to be adequate for most practical purposes.

The second comment concerns the scientific validity of personality
typing and its associated metrics, which is of great interest to
scientific psychologists and others who generally take a rigorous
scientific approach to matters (and personality typing can identify
those people!). Though there is no universal agreement, partly for the
reasons cited above, it is my belief that over 30 years of data
gathering has essentially confirmed the usefulness and accuracy of
personality typing. For further discussion about its reliability,
validity, and overall quality, which to psychometric specialists have
very specific meanings, consult the review article by DeVito in the
9th Mental Measurements Yearbook (MMY) as referenced in the Resource
Materials section of this Summary. Overall, this review article is
quite comprehensive and objective, showing both the strengths and
weaknesses of personality typing and its most often used metric, the
MBTI. It essentially supports the viewpoint that personality typing is
useful and accurate.

The third comment deals with how we are to view the four preference
scales. Some view them as strictly dichotomous (some relax that a bit
and assume a third choice, no preference, is equally valid). Others
view the scales as continuous scales, which can be measured by the
appropriate metric. This Summary, by default, takes the pure
dichotomous approach, but the continuous approach has some interesting
possibilities in fine tuning the model. The continuous scales
approach, however, makes the interpretation much more complex, putting
it out of the reach of the average lay person to quickly comprehend.
It is also unclear whether an accurate measurement along the
continuous scale is even possible, since it is highly dependent on the
choice, number, and quality of the questions used in the measuring
metric - no metric can possibly cover all the life situations that a
person could experience.

The fourth comment concerns whether personality types are genetically
determined, or develop during childhood and adolescence from cultural
and family influences (better known as the "Nature" vs. "Nurture"
debate). This is a very controversial area which has become quite
politicized because of the obvious social/political ramifications with
accepting either extreme. The general consensus seems to be that
personality type is determined by both in a fairly complex way, though
which one dominates has not been established.

To complicate matters even further, there are theories as well as
observations that personality type can change or shift as a person
ages. Some view this shift as a natural progression towards the "true"
or "innate" personality, due in part to the stripping away of the
personality masks that many put on in early life in response to
strongly incompatible type-influences, such as from family and the
surrounding culture. Others, who believe that "Nurture" plays the
dominant role in human personality, view the personality type change
as more of a random process due to the integral effect of outside
influences. Further discussion on the "Nature" vs. "Nurture" debate is
beyond the scope of this Summary.

I personally take the view that human personality is at least 50%
genetic - this is mentioned so the reader is aware of my bias in the
event I elsewhere make or imply such a viewpoint in this Summary.
There are many personality type experts/proponents who do not share my
views in this regard. Personality typing is just as valid for the
"Nurture" school of thought - it just has different interpretations
and ramifications.

============================================================================


V.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FOUR PREFERENCE SCALES

For each of the following four preference scales which underlie
personality typing, every person usually has a preference for one of
the two opposite, and equally good, choices (designated by a letter as
shown). This does not mean that they do one at the exclusion of the
other - most people will go either way depending on circumstances
outside their control. But most people usually do have an overall,
clear-cut *preference* for circumstances where they do have control.

How these scales are put together to form a personality "picture" or
type for an individual will be dealt with later.*

-----
*When a person does not perceive of a clear and resounding preference
for a particular scale, the letter 'X' is used to designate this "I
don't know" condition. There are differences of opinion as to the
meaning and significance of this inbetween/no preference, which is
briefly commented upon in the previous section. The 'X' preference
will not be discussed any further in this Summary.
-----

The four scales are:

Energizing - How a person is energized
Attending  - What a person pays attention to
Deciding   - How a person decides
Living     - Lifestyle a person prefers


Following are the preferences for each of the four scales:

1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:

        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside
                          world of people, activities or things.

        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal
                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.

        [Note:  In a deeper sense, energizing is only one facet of this
        scale -- it's really a measure of a person's whole orientation
        towards either the inner world (I) or the external world (E).]


2.  Attending - What a person pays attention to:

        Sensing (S)-   Preference for using the senses to notice what is real.

        Intuition (N)- Preference for using the imagination to envision what
                       is possible - to look beyond the five senses.  Jung
                       calls this "unconscious perceiving".

3.  Deciding - How a person decides:

        Thinking (T)- Preference for organizing and structuring information
                      to decide in a logical, objective way.

        Feeling (F)-  Preference for organizing and structuring information
                      to decide in a personal, value-oriented way.

4.  Living -  Life style a person prefers:

        Judgement (J)-  Preference for living a planned and organized life.

        Perception (P)- Preference for living a spontaneous and flexible life.

        [Note:  An alternative definition of this scale is "Closure - whether
        or not a person prefers an open-ended lifestyle."]


It is interesting to observe the distribution of these preferences in the
actual population.  Keirsey and Bates give the following distribution from
a 1964 study:

E (75%), I (25%)
S (75%), N (25%)
T (50%), F (50%)
J (50%), P (50%)

It is obvious that these percentages are only approximate, and more recent
studies appear to give somewhat different percentages.  The general trend,
however, of the 'I' and 'N' preferences significantly being in the minority
seems to hold true from all studies of general populations.

Once statistics are gathered, it is possible to test the original
Myers- Briggs theory that these four preference scales are orthogonal
(independent) of one another. Some studies indicate they are indeed
orthogonal, while other studies seem to indicate that they are
orthogonal with the exception of some observed minor correlation
between the S-N and the J-P scales.

There is also a small gender shift in the T-F scale, with approximately 60%
of all females being 'F', and 60% of the males being 'T'.

VI.  VOCABULARY FOR EACH PREFERENCE SCALE

There are several approaches to determine a person's preference for
each of the four preference scales. One approach is to take a test
such as the MBTI or the Keirsey-Bates (which is found in their book
"Please Understand Me"). Another excellent approach is to study the
preferred vocabulary for the four scales.

Summarized below are word lists associated with each preference for
the four scales. By reading and comparing the two word lists for each
scale, and determining which list you better relate and/or prefer,
will be a very strong indicator of your preference for that scale.
Consider these word lists to comprise a mini-test on personality
typing!

The preferred vocabulary lists also further explain what the four
scales actually measure or denote.

VII.  THE SIXTEEN PERSONALITY TYPES

The two preferences for each of the four independent scales give 16
unique combinations (2x2x2x2), each combination being designated a
personality type. The commonly accepted order for describing each
combination is given as:

Energizing:Attending:Deciding:Living .

For each of the these 16 types, quite detailed personality profiles
have been assembled from many years of application and analysis on
large populations of normal people, as well as theoretical analysis of
how the preference scales interact with each other. It is VERY
important to realize that these personality profile descriptions
(which could also be referred to as archetypes) are derived from large
populations, and some variation from the archetype is expected to
occur from individual to individual. One major source of variation,
but not the only one, is the possible presence of mental
illness/trauma (most often low self-image), which is not measured nor
even considered by the personality typing model. It is plausible that
the observable behavior from some forms of mental illness may be
strongly influenced by innate personality type (assuming there is such
a thing as an innate personality type).

There seems to be widespread agreement among those who study
personality typing that these personality profiles closely describe
the real personality of MOST people once their four-scale preferences
have been determined, either by taking a test such as the MBTI and/or
by a qualitative assessment such as studying the previous sections of
this Summary and the materials listed in the Resource Materials
section at the end of this Summary.

Anecdotal statements such as "the description was so right on the
money that I fell out of my chair", and "the profile was so much like
me it was eerie!", and similar anecdotes, are commonly expressed by
many people after reading their personality profile for the first
time. I myself had a similar reaction when I first read the profile
for the INFJ personality type; subsequent study of the other 15 types
confirmed that indeed the personality described in the INFJ profile
fits me much, much better than any of the others.

Though anecdotes do not form proper scientific "proof", nor should
they, the sheer number of such anecdotes have alone led many
personality typing researchers to privately conclude that personality
typing is a sufficiently accurate and useful model of normal human
personality.

Following is a very brief overview of the summary profiles for each of
the 16 types. Included for each type is the approximate percentage of
the general population being that type, using the 1964 Keirsey-Bates
percentages and assuming scale orthogonality. In addition, as
mentioned above, more comprehensive and accurate profiles exist
(again, see the Resource Materials section at the end of this Summary;
the anonymous ftp archive also contains more comprehensive profiles.)


ENFJ:  "Pedagogue".  Outstanding leader of groups.  Can be aggressive at
        "helping others to be the best that they can be".  5% of the total
        population.

ENFP:  "Journalist".  Uncanny sense of the motivations of others.  Life is an
        exciting drama;  emotionally warm;  empathic.  5% of the total
        population.

ENTJ:  "Field Marshall".  The basic driving force and need is to lead. Tends
        to seek a position of responsibility and enjoys being an executive.
        5% of the total population.

ENTP:  "Inventor".  Enthusiastic interest in everything and always sensitive
        to possibilities.  Non-conformist and innovative.  5% of the total
        population.

VIII.  THE FOUR KEIRSEY-BATES TEMPERAMENTS

There are other systems that have been developed to model human
personality. The most well-known and oft-used ones are those that
divide human personality into four major groups or temperaments.
Hippocrates in ancient Greece described the first four temperament
system, also known as the "Four Humors": Sanguine, Melancholic,
Choleric, and Phlegmatic.

More recently, Keirsey and Bates took the sixteen personality types
and categorized them into four recognizable temperaments based on
certain combinations of three of the four scales: SJ, SP, NT, and NF.
In addition, they named each temperament after the Greek mythological
figure who best exemplifies the world-view attributes of that
temperament:

NF  Apollo ("Reach for the Sky").
NT  Prometheus ("Foresight")
SJ  Epimetheus ("Hindsight")
SP  Dionysius ("Let's Drink Wine")

The four Keirsey-Bates temperaments appear to represent a person's
"Key Focus and/or Fundamental Emotional Need", while the 16 types
appear to represent a person's complete, day-to-day personality. The
Keirsey-Bates temperaments could also be described as the "bottom
line", the "motivation", or the "world-view" of one's personality.

There is some correlation and overlap between the Hippocratic Humors
and the Keirsey-Bates temperaments, but the fit is nowhere near
perfect. The main differences lie mostly in focus: the Hippocratic
Humors focus more on the neurotic aspects seen in some people, and so
have an overall negative connotation, while the Keirsey-Bates
temperaments focus strictly on normal, healthy personality and so are
much more universal and positive.

The four Keirsey-Bates temperaments are summarized as follows:  (Note:  The
lists of focus/needs/beliefs/behaviors for each temperament is an aggregate
list, meaning any one person of that temperament will probably exhibit or
have only some of these attributes.  The other two preference scales play a
role in this variation.)



NF:  SPIRIT/ETHICS  (Apollo)

Key Focus/Emotional Need:  Search for Self, and/or Peace and Harmony

Control

Order

                           To Have Fun

Beliefs/behaviors
-- Impulsive
-- Can be very expressive (esp. if an 'E')
-- To do what I want, when I want
-- Action to fulfill my current needs, impulses, not as investment for longer
   term need

-- Tremendous stamina
-- Management Style:  Troubleshooter, Negotiator, Fire Fighter
-- Spiritual Style:  St. Francis of Assisi



------
**Both the SJ and NT temperaments list similar beliefs. However, there
is a major difference between the two: to an SJ, a person "should" and
"ought" because that is the most "responsible" thing to do, while to
an NT, a person "should" and "ought" because that is the most
"competent" way to be. The fundamental motivations between the two
temperaments are quite dissimilar, despite leading to a similar
belief.

This book (originally written in the early 1920's) inspired Myers and

"Mistakes When Teaching Type", "Spending and Saving", and "Making
Love".
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Journal of Psychological Type_.  The official research journal of the
Association for Psychological Type, 9140 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, MO

One of the few outlets for research on the MBTI as most 'real' personality
psychologists usually do not publish on it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Mental Measurements Yearbook_ (MMY).  Has lists of references to articles
in
peer-reviewed journals in which the MBTI test is used.  An excellent review
of
MBTI is given by Anthony DeVito in the 9th MMY, and two additional reviews

The MMY are available in the reference section of most college and
