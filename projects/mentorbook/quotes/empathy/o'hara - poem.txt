I think of how some babies come screaming into the
world, seem
                      bad-tempered from the start, and how hard it is to
hold a baby like
                      that. Can I feel myself as the screaming baby,
uncomfortable,
                      dissatisfied? As the mother, frightened, irritated?
                      Can I catch my own irritation and fear and not run
from it? Can I
                      tolerate my own helplessness? Can I observe myself as
I rush to
                      defend my point of view with the same bullying
tactics
I condemn
                      in "the other"? To the extent than I can see the
soldier, the
                      fundamentalist, the terrorist in me^×view my own
"stuff" and not
                      seperate from it^×to that extent can I connect to
"the
other." It's
                      the same stuff.
                      So with each breath, I confirm that the skinheads are
my sons, the
                      fundamentalists, me. And each time I do this, there's
more space
                      inside of me and I can allow more in. Their
suffering,
my suffering.
                      In breath, out breath.
