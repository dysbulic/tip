The Other Side of the Coin

I am thankful:

For the teenager who is not doing dishes but is
watching t.v., because that means he is at home and
not on the streets.

For the taxes that I pay,
because it means that I am employed.

For the mess to clean after a party,
because it means that I have been surrounded by
friends.

For the clothes that fit a little too snug,
because it means I have enough to eat.

For my shadow that watches me work,
because it means I am out in the sunshine.

For a lawn that needs mowing, windows that need
cleaning, and gutters that need fixing, because it
means I have a home.

For all the complaining I hear about the
government, because it means that we have
freedom of speech.

For the parking spot I find at the far end of the
parking lot, because it means I am capable of
walking and that I have been blessed with
transportation.

For my huge heating bill,
because it means I am warm.

For the lady behind me in church that sings off key,
because it means that I can hear.

For the pile of laundry and ironing,
because it means I have clothes to wear.

For weariness and aching muscles at the end of
the day, because it means I have been capable of
working hard.

For the alarm that goes of in the early morning
hours, because it means that I am alive.

and finally.......

For too much e-mail,
because it means I have friends who are thinking of
me.  :-)
