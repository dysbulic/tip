"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is
that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our
darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be
brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not
to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the
world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other
people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest
the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's
in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconciously give
other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our
own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."

      - Nelson Mandela
