Salute to Miracles

(Martin Luther King Prayer Breakfast
Camp Dorothy Walls Jan. '00)

You will not hear fall from my lips
there is no such work as a miracle.
I have
seen Lazarus rise from the dead
time and time again.

Just when I thought this
life over,
I've seen wonders right above my head
Even when my focal point has
waned,
I have viewed angels.
At my greatest contempt for man
and myself I have
been humbled
by a quiet deed done unto me
with no thought of race or
compensation.

I will not give over my hope nor lay it down
before the shining
eyes of my youth.
I will lift it up in God's name
for this is my legacy
the
only thing I bequeath.

There are days I would rather die with my ineptness
of
not knowing how this world fits together mathematically,
Yet, time and time
again I have been asked to rise
to learn another lesson,
with the mouth of the
almighty
whispering in the conch of my hear,
"I am not finished with you yet."

I
am supposed to be alive.
I am destined to this life of fire.
I will not dismiss my
life to shame or fear.
I will wear my coat of Glenis
with an amulet of love
around my neck.
I stand before with lines
deep as pockets in my brow
showing
you I have struggled
and this has not been an easy life.
I am the granddaughter of a sharecropper
I continue to sing my song that evolved way before the cotton fields.
If you know the tune, I beg you to sing along.
I have been emancipated
by miracles.
Learning from the simple people in my life
to be earnest and
yearning,
open to beauty.

Yes, there are days I would like to fold my petals
and die
but in my knowing        I understand
I would just spring forth into
another day such as this.
So, today I will either flower or wilt beneath this
sun.
I will not spend my day
asking permission.
I will toil in celebratory
praise
doing what growing
things do.
