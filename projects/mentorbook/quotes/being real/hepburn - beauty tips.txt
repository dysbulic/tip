The following was written by Audrey Hepburn regarding "Beauty Tips."

For attractive lips,
Speak words of kindness.

For lovely eyes,
Seek out the good in people.

For a slim figure,
Share your food with the hungry.

For beautiful hair,
Let a child run his or her fingers through it once a day.

For poise,
Walk with the knowledge you'll never walk alone.

People, even more than things, have to be restored,
renewed, revived, reclaimed, and redeemed; Never
throw out anybody.

Remember, If you ever need a helping hand, you'll
find one at the end of your arm.
As you grow older, you will discover that you have
two hands, one for helping yourself, the other for
helping others.

The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she
wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs
her hair.  The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her
eyes,  because that is the doorway to her heart,
the place where love resides.

The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mole,
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her
soul.

It is the caring that she lovingly gives, the
passion that she shows,
And the beauty of a woman with passing years-only
grows!

If you send this to other women, something good
will happen -
You will boost another woman's self esteem.
