TWO ETHICAL QUESTIONS:

Question 1:
If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8 kids already (three
who were deaf, two who were blind, one who was mentally retarded), and
who had syphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion?


Question 2:
It is time to elect the world leader, and your vote counts  Here are the
facts about the three leading candidates:

Candidate A - Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with
astrologists. He's had two mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks
8 to 10 martinis a day.

Candidate B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used
opium in college and drinks a quart of whisky every evening.

Candidate C - He is a decorated war hero.  He's a vegetarian, doesn't
smoke, only drinks an occasional beer and hasn't had any extramarital
affairs.

Which of these candidates would be your choice? Decide first, no peeking,
then scroll down.

**************************************************







Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt
Candidate B is Winston Churchill
Candidate C is Adolf Hitler

...and by the way:
If you said yes to the abortion, you just killed Beethoven.
