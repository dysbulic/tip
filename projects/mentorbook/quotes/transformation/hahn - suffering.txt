We are all tempted to go to a place where there is no suffering,
where there is only peace and happiness. You may be tempted to
consider that the kingdom of Heaven is such a place, that the Pure
Land is such a place. We tend to believe that there is a place where
we can go by abandoning, or learning behind, this world full of
suffering, confusion, and pollution. The pollutions that afflict us
are anger and hatred, despair, sorrow and fear.

When you suffer so much, the tendency to want to leave it behind
becomes very strong. I don't want to be here any more, I want to get
out. "Stop the world, I want to get off."

Look deeply and you will touch the fact that happiness and well-being
cannot be separated from suffering and ill-being. This is the inter
being nature of happiness and suffering. There is an illusion to be
removed-that happiness can be without suffering, that wee-being can
be without ill-being that right can be without left.

If you don't know what hunger is, you would never know the pleasant
feeling of having something to eat. We all need some amount of
suffering in order to be able to appreciate the well-being and
happiness that are available to us. You need the darkness in order to
appreciate the beautiful morning.
