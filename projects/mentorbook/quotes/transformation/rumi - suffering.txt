He (God) gave to Pharaoh hundredfold possessions and riches, so that
he claimed (Divine) might and majesty.
In his whole life that man of evil nature felt no (spiritual)
headache, lest he should moan unto God.
God gave him all the empire of this world, (but) He did not give him
grief and pain and sorrows.
Grief is better than the empire of the world, so that you may call
unto god in secret.
The call of griefless is from a frozen heart*, the call of the
grieving one is from rapture:
('Tis) to withdraw the voice under the lips, to bear in mind (one's)
origin and beginning;
('Tis) the voice become pure and sad, (crying) "O God!" and "O Thou
whose help is besought!" and "O Helper!"
(Even) the moan of a dog for His sake is not void of (Divine)
attraction, because every one who desires (Him) is a brigand's
captive* --

--The Mathnawi of Jalaluddin Rumi

* Literally, "congelation."

*  I. e. "every seeker of God falls a prey to tribulation, with which
God afflicts him in order that it may be the means of drawing him
towards God."
