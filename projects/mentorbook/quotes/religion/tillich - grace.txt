Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness . . .
Sometimes at that moment a wave of light breaks into our darkness,
and it is as though a voice were saying:  "You are accepted.
You are accepted, accepted by that which is greater than you, and
the name of which you do not know. Do not ask for that name now;
perhaps you will find it later. Do not try to do anything now;
perhaps later you will do much. Do not seek for anything; do not
perform anything; do not intend anything.  Simply accept the fact
that you are accepted!" If that happens to us, we experience grace.
