I dreamed I had an interview with God.

      "So, you would like to interview me?" God asked.

      "If you have the time," I said.

God smiled.

      "My time is eternity; what questions
do you have in mind to ask me?"

      "What surprises you most about humankind?"

God answered:

      "That they get bored with childhood â€“ they
rush to grow up and then long to be children again.
      That they lose their health to make money and then lose
their money to restore their health.
      That by thinking anxiously about the future, they forget
the present, such that they live neither in the
present nor the future.
      That they live as if they will never die, and they die as
if they had never lived..."

God's hands took mine and we were silent for while and
then I asked...
      "As a parent, what are some of
life's lessons you want your children to learn?"

God replied with a smile:

      "To learn that they cannot make anyone love them.
      What they can do is to let themselves be loved.
      To learn that what is most valuable is not what they have
in their lives, but who they have in their lives.
      To learn that it is not good to compare themselves to
others.
      To learn that a rich person is not the one who has
the most, but is one who needs the least.
      To learn that it only takes a few seconds to open
profound wounds in persons one loves,
and that it may take many years to heal them.
      To learn to forgive by practicing forgiveness.
      To learn that there are persons who love them
dearly, but simply do not know how to express or
show their feelings.
      To learn that money can buy everything but
happiness.
      To learn that two people can look at the same thing and
see it very differently.
      To learn that it is not always enough that they be
forgiven by others, but that they must also forgive themselves.
      And to learn that I am here -- always."
