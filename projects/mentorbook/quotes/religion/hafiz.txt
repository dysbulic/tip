Dear Friends,

Have you heard of the 14th century Persian poet, Hafiz? I bought a book
called,  I Heard God Laughing, renderings by Daniel Ladinsky. It contains
some wonderful wisdom.

                I Am So Glad

           Start seeing everything as God,
            But keep it a secret.

         Become the man who is Awestruck
                And nourished

       Listening to the Golden Nightengale
          Sing in a beautiful language
           While God invisibly nests
              Upon its tongue.

                 Hafiz,
         Who can you tell in this world
         That when a dog runs up to you
            Wagging its ecstatic tail,
      You lean down and whisper in its ear,

                 "Beloved,
      I am so glad You are happy to see me.

                 Beloved,
               I am so glad,
        So very glad that you have come."
