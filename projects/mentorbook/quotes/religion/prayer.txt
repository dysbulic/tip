A New Day

Thank you for this new day, 
its beauty and light
Thank you for my chance to begin again.
Free me from the limitations of yesterday.
Today may I be reborn.
May I become more fully a reflection 
of Your radiance.
Give me strength, compassion and wisdom.
Show me the light in myself and others.
May I recognize the good that is 
available everywhere.
May I be, this day, an instrument 
of love and healing.
Lead me into gentle pastures.
Give me deep peace that I might
serve You most deeply.
