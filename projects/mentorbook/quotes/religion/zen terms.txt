Langya

Just think of the trees: they let the birds perch and fly, with no
intention to call them when they come and no longing for their return when
they fly away. If people's hearts can be like the trees, they will not be
off the Way.


Chuzhen

One single still light shines bright: if you intentionally pursue it,
after all it's hard to see. Suddenly encountering it, people's hearts are
opened up, and the great matter is clear and done. This is really living,
without any fetters -- no amount of money could replace it. Even if a
thousand sages should come, they would all appear in it's shadow.


Zhiqu

When you're deluded, every statement is an ulcer; when you're enlightened,
every word is wisdom.


Qingfu

The living meaning of Zen is beyond all notions. To realize it in a phrase
is completely contrary to the subtle essence; we cannot avoid using words
as expedients, though, but this has limitations. Needless to say, of
course, random talk is useless. Nonetheless, the matter is not one-sided,
so we temporarily set forth a path in the way of teaching, to deal with
people.


Puman

Someone asked, "What is your Way?"
Puman replied, "What is right now?"


Beiyuan

Someone asked, "What is no mind?"
Beiyuan replied, "Not being tied up."


Tongxuan

Someone asked, "Can one's own mind and the mind of another see
each other?"  Tongxuan replied, "If you can't even see yourself, how can
you see others?"
