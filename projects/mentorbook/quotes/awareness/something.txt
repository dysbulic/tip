Something To Think About
 
Should you find it hard to get to sleep tonight;
Just remember the homeless family who has no bed
to lie in.
 
Should you find yourself stuck in traffic; don't
despair. There are people in this world for whom driving
is an unheard of privilege.
 
Should you have a bad day at work; Think of the man
who has been out of work for the last three months.
 
Should you despair over a relationship gone bad;
Think of the person who has never known what it's
like to love and be loved in return.
 
Should you grieve the passing of another weekend;
Think of the woman in some third world country,
working twelve hours a day, seven days a week,
for $15.00 to feed her family.
 
Should your car break down, leaving you miles
away from assistance; Think of the paraplegic
who would love the opportunity to take that walk.
 
Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror;
Think of the cancer patient in chemo who wishes
she had hair to examine.
 
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering;
what is life all about, what is my purpose?
Be thankful, there are those who didn't live long
enough to get the opportunity.
 
Should you find yourself the victim of other
people's bitterness, ignorance, smallness or
insecurities; Remember, things could be worse.
You could be them!!!
 
Should you feel depressed because of your weight;
Remember, obesity is curable; AIDS is not.
