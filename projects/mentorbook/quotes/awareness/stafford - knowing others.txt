      A Ritual to Read to Each Other...

If you don't know the kind of person I am
and I don't know the kind of person you are,
a pattern that others made may prevail in the world
and following the wrong god home, we may miss our own star.

For there is many a small betrayal in the mind;
a shrug that lets the fragile sequence break,
sending with shouts the horrible errors of childhood
storming out through the broken dike.

And, as elephants parade holding each other's tail;
but if one wanders, the circus won't find the park,
I call it cruel and maybe the root of all cruelty
to know what occurs but not recognize the fact!

And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,
a remote important region in all who talk:
though we could fool each other, we should consider--
lest the parade of our mutual lives get lost in the dark.

For it is important that awake people be awake,
or a breaking line may discourage us back to sleep;
the signals we give-- "yes or no, or maybe"â€”-
should be clear: the darkness around us is deep.


        William Stafford
