Each Moment

Each moment of love,
each moment of giving,
each moment of joy
is a moment of living.

Each moment of anger,
each moment of lying,
each moment of resentment
is a moment of dying.

All our moments add together,
like the digits in a sum
and the answers tells us plainly
whether life or death will come.
