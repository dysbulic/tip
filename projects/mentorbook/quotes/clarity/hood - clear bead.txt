beautiful writing, melodie. keep going!!

writing helpsyou clarify.

about forgiveness. you are starting up climbing a new mt. you can't see the
top or over the other side. forgiving john feels like some sort of betrayal
of who  you are. but you are  supposed to be LOSING DROPPING FORGETTING
LETTING GO OF WHO YOU ARE. this you is going to die so a new adn stronger,
more beautiful, more spiritual you can be born. it has to come out of the
ashed of the old you, it can't hold on to the  old you and be born. it's a
terrible risk. remember all my talking about being claled to cross the
grand canyon on a tightrope blindfolded in an earth quake? what do you
think i was talking about? it's letting go of what YOU WANT adn letting og
of HAVING THINGS THE WAY YOU WANT THEM TO BE because that is yoru little
ego mind talking, not your bigger spiritual self talking.

-does that make sense? remember rumi?

------------
The clear bead at the center changes everything.
There are no edges to my loving now.

I've heard it said there's a window that opens
from one mind to another.

but if there's no wall, there's no need
for fitting the window, or the latch.

                 -- Rumi

from OPEN SECRET:VERSIONS OF RUMI, by john moyne and colemn barks

---------------
how do we get the clear bead? by letting go of our attatchmnets. to our way
o fhavbing things. getting clear in teh Flow or TAO is to trust the larger
universe adn let go and let god. i know it isjn't easy. adn it does feel
like betray of of who we are. butit is betrayal of an old outlived self
that has to go so the new self that can trust in itself so much it can be
open to anything--NO DEFENSES-- CAN EMERGE.

does this makse sense yet? comment back to me?

keep on trying... writing... loving.
