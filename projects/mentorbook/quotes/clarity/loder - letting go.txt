Guide Me into an Unclenched Moment

Gentle me,
Holy One,
into an unclenched moment,
    a deep breath,
        a letting go
            of heavy expectancies,
                of shriveling anxieties,
                    of dead certainties,
that, softened by silence,
    surrounded by the light,
        and open to the mystery,
I may be found by wholeness,
    upheld by the unfathomable,
        entranced by the simple,
            and filled with the joy
                    that is You.
