     Our story so far: A quiet mathematical prodigy grows up in a
     family of high technology schemers into a cocky, charismatic youth.
     He drops out of school and leaves his country to dodge military
     service.

     Museum Boerhaave/The Papers of Albert Einstein

     Einstein posed with his friend and mentor Hendrik A. Lorentz, the
     physicist, in Leiden, Holland.
       ______________________________________________________________

     In college he alienates his teachers by cutting class. He breaks
     his mother's heart by falling in love with an older foreign woman
     and fathering an illegitimate child, and eventually marrying her.

     Moonlighting at science, while working as a minor civil servant, he
     publishes a series of papers challenging conventional notions of
     space, time and the nature of light, and works his way up the
     academic ladder, becoming estranged from his wife, who is depressed
     and jealous of other women. He begins an affair in another city.

     So has life episodically unfolded, over 12 years, seven volumes and
     thousands of pages of the Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, a
     massive effort to publish all the 43,000 or so documents Einstein
     left behind at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study when he
     died in 1955.

     This spring, the eighth and thickest installment of this saga,
     Volume Eight, was published by the Princeton University Press in
     two parts totaling 1,118 pages, carrying Einstein through four of
     the most heroic and stormy years of his life, from 1914 to 1918,
     when, among other things, he finished work on his crowning
     achievement, the general theory of relativity.

     Its most startling revelation is that in the spring of 1918,
     Einstein considered breaking off his engagement to his cousin Elsa
     Einstein and marrying her 20-year-old daughter, Ilse, instead. And
     the new volume calls into question the degree of Einstein's
     commitment to antiwar politics in wartime Berlin.

     Most importantly, though, the papers here illuminate the tortured
     and confused path by which Einstein finally completed his long
     quest to extend the principle of relativity to explain gravity and
     the universe. Even Einstein, it seems, found it hard to be
     Einstein.

     "In these pages," said Dr. Robert Schulmann, a Boston University
     historian and director of the Einstein Papers Project, "we can
     closely observe Einstein on his solitary path to general
     relativity, on which personal relations are sometimes callously
     sacrificed in the name of scientific ambition."

     Volume Eight marks middle age for Einstein and middle age as well
     for one of the most monumental and star-crossed efforts in the
     history of science.

     The collection has already transformed scholars' view of Einstein,
     shedding a sometimes unflattering light on his personal life, and
     launching a wave of new biographies and television specials.

     "You just can't do any work, not just on Einstein but on early
     20th-century science, without referring to these volumes," said Dr.
     Gerald Holton of Harvard University, a physicist, historian and
     Einstein scholar.

     A warts-and-all approach was exactly what the founders of the
     Papers Project had in mind and the trustees of the Einstein estate
     feared. A publishing agreement between Princeton University Press
     and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, to which Einstein left his
     papers and which he helped found, was signed in 1971, but work was
     delayed for several years by a lawsuit filed by Dr. Otto Nathan, a
     Princeton economist and Einstein's executor.

     Dr. Nathan, who was protective of Einstein's public image,
     challenged the appointment of Dr. John Stachel, a Boston University
     physics professor with whom he had clashed, as sole editor. Only a
     committee could do justice to the breadth of Einstein's interests,
     Dr. Nathan argued.

     An arbitrator ruled in favor of Dr. Stachel in 1981, but the work
     was already off to a late start. It was further delayed by the
     spectacular discovery of Einstein's love letters to his college
     sweetheart and first wife, Mileva Maric, which disclosed the birth
     of their illegitimate daughter, Lieserl, in 1902. (She is believed
     to have been born in Serbia, and her fate is unknown.)

     Meanwhile, Dr. Schulmann said, continuing research has only
     increased the project's work.

     Diligent scrounging in attics and archives, and the courting of
     collectors and descendants of Einstein's friends and family, have
     produced another 25,000 papers.

     The original archive is now in Jerusalem and is open to scholars,
     as are copies in the libraries of Princeton and Boston University,
     where the Papers Project is headquartered. To the occasional
     chagrin of independent historians and journalists, the so-called
     supplemental archive that the project has assembled is not.

     Moreover, there is another archive that is off-limits even to the
     Papers Project. An undetermined number of letters have been
     "sequestered," in Dr. Schulmann's phrase, in a classified archive
     at the Hebrew University until 2006. Dr. Schulmann said he did not
     know what was in the sealed archive and admitted it was
     "uncomfortable" for a historian to be in the position of presenting
     only a partial record.

     The most significant discovery to date of the Papers Project has
     been Einstein's letters to Mileva.

     Subsequent volumes have revealed unflattering details of Einstein's
     marriage, including the affair with Elsa and a bossy memorandum
     detailing the conditions under which he would go on living with
     Mileva.

     The editors are unapologetic for airing dirty linen. "To me this
     makes him more human," said Dr. Schulmann, who said he still liked
     Einstein and admired the way he thumbed his nose at authority. "The
     Einstein we're trying to recover in these volumes is a living,
     breathing personality with faults.

     We want to see what kind of personal style he had and what kind of
     scientific style he had."

     That style is vividly on display in Volume Eight, which Dr. Holton
     described as project's "high point."

     "In many ways it was the best of times and the worst of times for
     Einstein," Dr. Holton said.

     He finished working out general relativity, but within a few months
     of his arrival, his wife and children had left him and World War I
     broke out, stranding him in a sea of German militarism and wartime
     deprivation.

     Einstein's theory, which explains how matter and energy "curve" the
     geometry of space-time to create the phenomenon known as gravity,
     has been called one of the greatest intellectual feats of all time.
     Einstein completed the theory in the fall of 1915 after eight years
     of struggle. Intriguingly, Einstein had actually written down the
     correct formulation as early as 1912 or 1913, but then abandoned it
     in favor of a different version called the "Entwurf," meaning
     design or blueprint, which he had cooked up with his old friend,
     the mathematician Marcel Grossmann.

     One of Einstein's strengths was that he trusted his gut feelings,
     said Dr. Michel Janssen, a professor of physics and philosophy at
     Boston University and co-editor of Volume Eight. But sometimes, Dr.
     Janssen said, he could fool himself.

     For example, Einstein discarded his original formulation of general
     relativity by coming up with a problem he called the "hole
     argument," which addressed the question of whether the universe was
     uniquely determined by the arrangement of its contents. Einstein
     believed that it must be, and that his original formulation would
     violate that principle.

     In the fall of 1915, however, when the Entwurf theory was falling
     apart for other reasons, and the mathematician David Hilbert of
     Goettingen University was also on the trail of general relativity,
     Einstein changed his tune. He adopted a resolution of the hole
     argument that he had previously rejected and reinstated his
     original theory.

     "Einstein is good at believing what he wants to believe at various
     stages of the game," Dr. Janssen said. "In 1913, the last thing he
     wants is to escape from the hole argument. He has too much invested
     in his Entwurf. In 1915, he wants the hole argument to evaporate.
     Einstein was a bit of an opportunist."

     Einstein's personal life was marked by a streak of callousness and
     aloofness, Dr. Schulmann said. Nowhere is that more evident than in
     the strange letter, dated May 25, 1918, that Ilse Einstein sent to
     her close friend Georg Nicolai, a doctor, well-known antiwar
     crusader and Einstein family friend, with the words, "Please
     destroy this letter immediately after reading it" scrawled across
     the top in big letters. At the time Einstein, who had moved to
     Berlin four years earlier to take a lucrative appointment to the
     Prussian Academy of Sciences and become director of the newly
     formed Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics, was 38 years old and in
     the process of divorcing Mileva, presumably so that he could marry
     his cousin Elsa. Ilse, the older of Elsa's two daughters, was
     serving as Einstein's secretary.

     The letter was a plea for advice. In it Ilse related how a simple
     "jest" one afternoon had suddenly escalated into a serious proposal
     that Einstein marry her instead of her mother. Einstein, she said,
     had confessed that he loved her. Moreover her mother, she reported,
     was prepared to step aside, if that was what would make Ilse happy.

     "Albert himself is refusing to take any decision; he is prepared to
     marry either Mama or me," Ilse wrote. "I know that A. loves me very
     much, perhaps more than any other man ever will, he also told me so
     himself yesterday," she went on.

     The feelings, however, were not quite reciprocal. Ilse loved
     Einstein like a father, she wrote, but she had no desire to be
     close to him physically. Her instinct, she confessed, was not to
     marry him. "It will seem peculiar to you that I, a silly little
     thing of a 20-year-old, should have to decide on such a serious
     matter; I can hardly believe it myself and feel very unhappy doing
     so as well. Help me!"

     There is no evidence that the relationship with Ilse was ever
     consummated. Einstein and Elsa were married the next year and
     remained husband and wife until her death in 1936. (Ilse later
     married Rudolf Kayser, a writer and literary critic who
     subsequently wrote a biography of Einstein. She died of
     tuberculosis in 1933.)

     Ilse's letter first came to the attention of the Einstein scholars
     in the early 1990's. At least one of the other editors, Dr.
     Schulmann said, thought the letter might be a product of Ilse's
     imagination.

     "I take it very seriously," said Dr. Schulmann, noting that Nicolai
     was a former lover of Ilse, as well as an older man, in whom it
     would be natural for her to confide.

     He said he saw the letter and the situation it described as an
     example of Einstein's vaunted ability to detach himself from the
     people around him. "The most telling point is that he doesn't
     care," Dr. Schulmann said. "That's the Einstein we know. He is
     indifferent to the question of whether he marries one or the
     other."

     Ilse and her confidant Nicolai also emerge in the new volume as key
     influences on Einstein's political activities during the war.
     Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Einstein was one of only
     three people to sign an "Appeal to Europeans" deploring the
     destruction of international culture, making him a hero to the
     pacifist movement, and he attended meetings of a pacifist political
     club, the Bund Neues Vaterland. Historians have long thought that
     Einstein drew up the manifesto, but the evidence, Dr. Schulmann
     said, suggests that it was actually written by Nicolai, an antiwar
     crusader, and author of a book called "The Biology of War."

     But, again, detachment characterized Einstein's actions. At the
     same time that he was attending antiwar meetings, presumably at the
     behest of Ilse and Elsa, Dr. Schulmann said, Einstein consulted for
     a maker of submarine gyroscopes and even tried to design an
     airplane for the military. In his letters he often said that the
     war did not intrude on him. "Why shouldn't one let the servants
     live happily in the madhouse?" he wrote to a Swiss friend.

     After the Bund was outlawed in 1916, Einstein stopped attending
     meetings and resisted Nicolai's continuing schemes. Einstein
     "identified with the underdog and the outcast," Dr. Schulmann
     observed, "but he was not prepared to march in the ranks."

     The slow pace of publishing the papers has provoked criticism from
     other scholars.

     In an interview, Dr. David Cahan, a historian of German physics at
     the University of Nebraska, said that publishing a series of bound
     volumes over the years was too slow and costly and wrongly
     concentrated resources on the editorial process rather than on the
     historical process.

     "I'd like to see the E.P.P. put everything on the Web and
     simultaneously transform its quarters at B.U. into a true and open
     research and conference center devoted to Einstein scholarship," he
     said.

     In fact, Dr. Holton said, the option of publishing the Einstein
     papers in a facsimile form was considered back at the beginning and
     rejected in favor of the traditional style of extensive annotation
     and accompanying essays.

     Dr. Schulmann said, "The goal is to provide as thick a context as
     possible."

     No one knows how long it will take the project to finish its task,
     which is projected to encompass at least 25 volumes. Dr. Schulmann
     said it would take another 10 volumes to carry Einstein's story to
     1933, when he left Berlin and came to America. There is already so
     much material that project officials are beginning to leave some
     things out. Walter Lippincott, the director of the Princeton
     University Press, likes to joke that he will be dead and his
     children will be dead by the time the last volume rolls off the
     presses.

     Dr. Holton is undaunted. He noted that it took a lifetime to
     publish the papers of Thomas Jefferson.
