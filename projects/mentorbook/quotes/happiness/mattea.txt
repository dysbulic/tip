"Come from the Heart" by Kathy Mattea.
Written by Susanna Clark & Richard Leigh

My Daddy told me when I was a young girl
A lesson he learned, it was a long time ago
If you want to have someone to hold onto
You're gonna have to learn to let go

(chorus)
You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watching
It's gotta come from the heart if you want it to work.

Now here is the one thing I keep forgettin'
When everythign if falling apart
In life as in love, you know I need to remember
There's such a thing as trying too hard.
