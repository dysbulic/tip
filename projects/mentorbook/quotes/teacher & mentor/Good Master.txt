      A true Master is not the one with most students,
but one who creates the most Masters.
      A true leader is not the one with most followers,
but one who creates the most leaders.
      A true king is not the one with the most subjects,
but one leads the most to royalty.
      A true teacher is not the one with the most knowledge,
but one how causes the most others to have knowledge.
