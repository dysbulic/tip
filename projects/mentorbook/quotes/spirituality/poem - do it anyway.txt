 Do it anyway...

     Food for thought:

  People are often unreasonable,
  Illogical, and self-centered;
  Forgive them anyway.

  If you are kind,
  People may accuse you of selfish,
  ulterior motives;
  Be kind anyway.

  If you are successful,
  You will win some false friends
  and some true enemies;
  Succeed anyway.

  If you are honest and frank,
  People may cheat you;
  Be honest and frank anyway.

  What you spend years building,
  Someone could destroy overnight;
  Build anyway.

  If you find serenity and happiness,
  They may be jealous;
  Be happy anyway.

  The good you do today,
  People will often forget tomorrow;
  Do good anyway.

  Give the world the best you have,
  And it may never be enough;
  Give the world the best you've got anyway.

  You see, in the final analysis,
  It is between you and God;
  It never was between you and them anyway.
