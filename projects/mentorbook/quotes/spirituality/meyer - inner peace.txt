Dear Ones,

Be on the lookout for symptoms of inner peace. The hearts of a great
many have already been exposed to inner peace and it is possible that
people everywhere could come down with it in epidemic proportions. This
could pose a serious threat to what has, up to now, been a fairly stable
condition of conflict in the world.

Some signs to look for:

* A tendency to think and act spontaneously rather than on fears based
on past experiences.

* An unmistakable ability to enjoy each moment.

* A loss of interest in judging other people.

* A loss of interest in interpreting the actions of others.

* A loss of interest in conflict.

* A loss of the ability to worry. (This is a very serious symptom.)

* Frequent, overwhelming episodes of appreciation.

* Contented feelings of connectedness with others and nature.

* Frequent attacks of smiling.

* An increasing tendency to let things happen rather than make them
happen.

* An increased susceptibility to the love offered by others as well as
the uncontrollable urge to extend it.

Agape,
Kevin
