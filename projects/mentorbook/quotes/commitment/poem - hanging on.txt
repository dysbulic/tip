Just Hang On
           -Bruce B. Wilmer

In all the times that seem so hard
   When tears cry out inside,
You must explore new ways to live,
   Reverse depression's tide.

When all of your solutions
   Stay away, remain unknown,
And you are isolated
   in your heart and feel alone,

Remember that the world
   Is full of others just like you
And you can reach beyond the darkness,
   Change your point of view.

Everyone has moments
   When their problems seem too much.
Everyone has joys that seem
   Elusive, out of touch.

But when it all seems very bleak
   And hope has all but gone,
Remember, time will heal your heavy thoughts
   If you'll hang on.
