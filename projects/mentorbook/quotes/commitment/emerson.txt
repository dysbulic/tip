All great masters are chiefly distinguished by the power of adding a
second, a third, and perhaps a fourth step in a continuous line. Many
a man had taken the first step. With every additional step you enhance
immensely the value of your first.
                                     -Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
