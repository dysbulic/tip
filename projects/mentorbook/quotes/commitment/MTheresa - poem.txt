   Do It Anyway
   Written By Mother Teresa


   People are often unreasonable, illogical,
   and self-centered;
   Forgive them anyway.

   If you are kind, People may accuse you
   of selfish, ulterior motives;
   Be kind anyway.

   If you are successful, you will win some
   false friends and some true enemies;
   Succeed anyway.

   If you are honest and frank,
   people may cheat you;
   Be honest and frank anyway.

   What you spend years building, someone
   could destroy overnight;
   Build anyway.

   If you find serenity and happiness,
   they may be jealous;
   Be happy anyway.

   The good you do today,
   people will often forget tomorrow;
   Do good anyway.

   Give the world the best you have,
   and it may never be enough;
   Give the world the best you've got anyway.

   You see, in the final analysis,
   it is between you and God;
   It was never between you and them anyway.
