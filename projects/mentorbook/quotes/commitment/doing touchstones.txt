Subject: for mhb. touchstone by mcbee and my comment, nameittameit claimit,
etc.

first, this is hwat i am trying to get all of you to do. take one
touchstone every day and type it in and comment on it. send your comments
to everyone. i tried one year getting everyone in the group to do the same
one each day and send out the ir stuff at the same time, btu that really
didn't work. think of the procrastination!!

but there are MANY MANY valuable reasons for doing the touchstone
disciplines. i woudl hope i woudanl't haev to enumerate them for you. adn
fo ryou to read one anotehr's. 'GOD USES US TO HELP EACH OTHER SO/LENDING
OUR MINDS OUT' [quick: where's that from?!]

also.  this touchstone in particular. it gives another slant to a kind of
slogan that one of the helper groups created years ago [i dont' think it
was AA, but i can't remember...]

NAME IT
CLAIM IT
TAME IT

can you remember that:? isn't that the core of this touchstone? name what
the problem is.be willing to claim it: recognize that it is yours and you
are doing it. tame it, come to terms with it, recognize the dragon, learn
how to LOVE it and transform it into a gift, not a monster. tame the
dragon.

comments? anyone else ready to take ont eh touchstone discip[line as a
challenge for growth?

thank you , matt.

LOVE! [<-- it's more than an imperative....it's the universe]

> Behavior cannot be changed until one "owns" or accepts the current

> kind of psychological disorder called a character disorder.
> Basically, when one suffers from a character disorder, one refuses
> to take responsibility for one's action. The example given in the
> book is of a man that has a drinking problem. During his interview
> with Peck, the man refuses to accept any responsibility for his
> problem. He talks about how there is nothing to do on the island
> except drinking. Peck suggests several other activities that the man
> says he enjoys. Then the man says that "this damn island would drive
> anyone to drink." Character disorders are a relatively common thing.
> All of us experience them from time to time.
>
> Breaking out of character disorders requires the courage to own your
> actions. No one likes to admit that they are causing a problem.
> However, if one can objectively consider the situation, and be
> honest with oneself, then character disorders can be avoided.
>
> Once the actions are "owned", then we can decide how to go about
> breaking free of them. This task is often difficult, but in my
> opinion not as difficult as admitting the existance of the problem.

> Accepting responsibility for our actions allows us to be free. When
