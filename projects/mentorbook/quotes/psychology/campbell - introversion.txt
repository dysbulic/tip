I've been reading Joseph Campbell's _The Hero With a Thousand Faces_
and ran across this description of intentional introversion in the
role of the hero overcoming troubles:


Willed introversion is one of the classic implements of creative genius and can
be employed as a deliberate device.  It drives the psychic energies into depth
and activates the lost continent of unconscious infantile and archetypal images. 
The result, of course, may be a disintegration of consciousness more or less
(neurosis, psychosis:  the plight of spellbound Daphne); but on the other hand,
if the personality is able to absorb and integrate the new forces, there will
be experienced an almost super-human degree of self-consciousness and masterful
control.  This is a basic principle of the Indian disciplines of yoga.  It has
been the way, also, of many creating spirits in the West.  It cannot be
described, quite, as an answer to any specific call.  Rather, it is a
deliberate, terrific refusal to respond to anything but the deepest, highest,
richest answer to the as yet unknown demand of some waiting void within:  a
kind of total strike, or rejection of the offered terms of life, as a result of
which some power of transformation carries the problem to a plane of new
magnitudes, where it is suddenly and finally resolved.
