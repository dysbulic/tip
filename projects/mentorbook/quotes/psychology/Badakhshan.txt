There are three ways of presenting anything.
    The first is to present everything.
    The second is to present what people want.
    The third is to present what will serve them best.
    If you present everything, the result may be surfeit.
    If you present what people want, it may choke them.

   If you present what will serve them best, the worst is that,
misunderstanding, they may oppose you.  But if you have served them thus,
whatever the appearances, you have served them and you, too, must benefit,
whatever the appearances.

      --Ajmal of Badakhshan
