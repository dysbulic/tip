Yes, actually I do see the distinction, but to me a value loaded label
doesn't necessarily indicate psychological unhealth and also whether a
label is just a statement of fact or whether it comes with additional
connotations seems to be dependent on who is using the word, how it is
being used and a lot of unwritten data that accompanies word usage,
particularly the spoken or thought word.

      To take up your examples: looking in the mirror and sayin "I'm
fat"  gives two pieces of information: I'm overweight and I don't like it.
In that sense it is a statement of value ( I prefer being fit to being fat
) but does not necessarily mean that I am berating myself for my
condition.  On the flip side, those 4 precious little letters from the MBI
are often used in a perjorative or self deprecating sense.  "My poor XXXX
mind couldn't handle it" or "she is so XXXX"  You can read a lot into
those statements, even if you had the full context of their usage.  They
can be either a statement of fact giving hundreds of data points about a
person in just 4 characters or they can be value laden comparisons.

      What I am questioning or even challenging is not your definition
of mere label versus value laden label.  I actually appreciate and
understand in my own limited way the succinct definition you provided.
What I am digging after here is the either/or aspect of the definition
itself or maybe the either/or aspect of how I'm reading and understanding
the definition.  There is still the sense that words with values attached
are undesireable and unhealthy, and I don't believe that.
