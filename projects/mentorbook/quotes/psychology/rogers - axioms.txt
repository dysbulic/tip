Subj: rogers' axioms : something i woudl like for you all to discuss on
sohbet bbs? please?

derek sent a neat questoin in a jorunal that, as i thought about it, had
interesting implicatoins.

he asked if honesty and openness are the same thing. matt mcbee has asked
near the same question. when you hold back anything, are you being
dishonest? my answer for the minnows has always been that you don't haev to
tell everyone everything, adn what you do say needs to be tempered with
empathy. that can 'feel' dishonest, yes? esp. for thinkers.

as i thougth about how to asnwer this, looking at statges of developemnt
adn stages of life answers, the most beautiful thing popped into my head:

when you LIVE all 4 of the rogers axioms, as you approach living them in
perfectoin [which we assume no one as do], with perfect empathy and
unconditionality, then all four ARE THE SAME THING. they are one.

it's like saying 'i AM LOVE' instead of saying i am Loving. most of you
can't understand the differenc e in those two states yet. don't worry abotu
it. :)

woudl you please post this to teh bbs, treat it as a koan for this weekend
and see what you learn as you think about it? [the rogers living them in
perfectoin being one. and same., not the i am Love. :)] i woudl be
interested in hearing your various reactoins and seeing them on sohbet.

thanks,... i shall now cease my nocturnal lucubrations and go to bed,
before i leave town tomrorow for hte day. see the neophytes sunday night!
the rest of you next week,  i hope.

shantih,
c
