Add the total number of points.

OVER 60 POINTS: Others see you as someone they should "handle with
care."  You are seen as vain, self-centered, and extremely dominant.
Others may admire you and wish they could be more like you, but they
don't always trust you and hesitate to become too deeply involved with
you.

FROM 51 TO 60 POINTS: Your friends see you as an exciting, highly
volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, quick to make
decisions (though not always the right ones). They see you as bold and
venturesome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes
a chance and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company
because of the excitement you radiate.

FROM 41 TO 50 POINTS: Others see you as fresh, lively, charming,
amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who is constantly
the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it
go to your head.  They see you also as kind, considerate, and
understanding;
someone who will cheer them up and help them out.

FROM 31 TO 40 POINTS: Other people see you as sensible, cautious,
careful, and practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented,
but
modest.  Not a person who makes friends too quickly or too easily, but
someone who is extremely loyal to the friends you do make and who
expects the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you
realize that it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but,
equally,
that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is broken.

FROM 21 TO 30 POINTS: Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy.
  They see you as very, very cautious and extremely careful, a slow and
steady plodder. It would really surprise them if you ever did something
impulsively or on the spur of the moment. They expect you to examine
everything carefully from every side and then, usually decide against
it.
They think this reaction on your part is caused partly by your careful
nature and partly by laziness.

UNDER 21 POINTS: People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive,
someone who needs to be looked after, who always wants someone
else to make the decisions and who doesn't want to get involved with
anyone or anything.  They see you as a worrier, who sees problems
that don't exist.  Some people think you're boring. Only the people who
know you well know that you aren't.

Now, forward this to everyone you know-make sure you put your score
in as the subject!!!!!
