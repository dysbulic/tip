THE INVITATION

It doesn't matter to me what you do for a living.
I want to know what you ache for,
and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.
It doesn't interest me how old you are.
I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love for your
dreams,
for the adventure of being alive.
It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring with your moon.
I want to know if you have touched the center of your sorrow,
If you have been opened by life's betrayals or you have become shriveled
and closed from the fear of future pain!
I want to know if you can sit with pain; mine or your own.
If you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you
to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful,
be realistic, or remember the limitations of being human.
It doesn't interest me if the story you tell me is true.
I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself.
If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul.
If you can be faithful and, therefore be trustworthy.
I want to know if you can see beauty even when it's not present everyday,
and if you can source your own life from IT's presence.
I want to know if you can live with failure; yours or mine;
and still stand on the edge of the lake
and shout to the sliver of the full moon, "YES!"
It doesn't interest me to know where you live
or how much money you have.
I want to know if you can get up after a night of grief and despair,
weary and bruised to the bone
and do what needs to be done for the children.
It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied,
I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.
I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like
the company you keep in the empty moments.
