Scoring Key
Add your ratings for each of the three sections – intimacy, passion, and
commitment/ decision – and write the totals in the blanks below. Divide
each subscore by 15 to get an average subscale score.
|________      |÷ 15 =    |________            |
|intimacy      |          |intimacy            |
|subscore      |          |average rating      |
|________      |÷ 15 =    |________            |
|passion       |          |passion             |
|subscore      |          |average rating      |
|________      |÷ 15 =    |________            |
|decision/     |          |decision/           |
|commitment    |          |commitment          |
|subscore      |          |average rating      |


An average rating of 5 on a particular subscale indicates a  moderate  level
of the component represented  by  the  subscale;  for  example,  an  average
rating of 5  on  the  intimacy  subscale  indicates  a  moderate  amount  of
intimacy in the relationship you chose to measure.  Following  this  example
further, a higher average rating would indicate a higher level of  intimacy,
and a lower average rating would  indicate  a  lesser  amount  of  intimacy.
Examining your ratings for each of the three  subscales  will  give  you  an
idea of how you perceive your love relationship to be  composed  of  various
amounts of intimacy, passion, and decision/ commitment.
