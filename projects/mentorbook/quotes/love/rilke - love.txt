...To love is good, too: love being difficult. For one human being to love
another: that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the
last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation. For
this reason young people, who are beginners in everything, cannot yet know
love: they have to learn it. With their whole being, with all their forces,
gathered close about their lonely, timid, upward-beating heart, they must learn
to love. But learning-time is always a long, secluded time, and so loving, for
a long while ahead and far on into life, is -- solitude, intensified and
deepened loneliness for him who loves. Love is at first not anything that means
merging, giving over, and uniting with another (for what would a union be of
something unclarified and unfinished, still subordinate ---?), it is a high
inducement to the individual to ripen, to become something in himself, to
become world, to become world for himself for another's sake, it is a great
exacting claim upon him, something that chooses him out and calls him to vast
things. Only in this sense, as the task of working at themselves ("to hearken
and to hammer day and night"), might young people use the love that is given
them. Merging and surrendering and every kind of communion is not for them (who
must save and gather for a long, long time still), is the ultimate, is perhaps
that for which human lives as yet scarcely suffice.
