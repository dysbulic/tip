|This Thing Called Love                                         |

|People know it when they feel it, but can scientists tell us   |
|why?                                                           |
|Two Yale psychologists are trying.                             |
|                                                               |
|In the late 1950s, a rock and roll group known as the Monotones|
|wondered "who wrote the book of love?" Philosophers, poets, and|
|couples consumed with passion-as well as those trying to       |
|determine why the flames went out-have been asking the same    |
|questions for eons. And now, even scientists have entered the  |
|fray, wiring the brain with electrodes and watching for        |
|telltale signs of electrical ecstasy, as well as searching for |
|the elusive molecules that bind one lover to another.          |
|To be sure, no one has been entirely successful, but Robert    |
|Sternberg '72, Yale's IBM Professor of Psychology and Education|
|Psychology, has at least come up with an intriguing answer to  |
|the Monotones' plaintive query. "Love is a story," Sternberg   |
|says, "a story each of us is constantly writing and rewriting. |
|Love develops, grows, and lasts when a person finds someone    |
|else who fits what his or her particular story is all about."  |
|There are a number of Yale researchers examining various       |
|aspects of love's mysterious tale. For example, Laura King, an |
|assistant professor of English, is studying medieval texts that|
|warned people about the dangers of romantic love and encouraged|
|them to pursue more spiritually oriented liaisons. Sociologist |
|Joshua Gamson is investigating the phenomenon of homosexuality |
|and the social movements that it has spawned. Susan Treggiari, |
|a visiting professor of history, is looking at love and        |
|marriage among the ancient Romans.                             |
|Surprisingly, given the University's strength in the           |
|neurosciences, there are no Yale physiologists involved in     |
|scholarly pursuits of an amorous nature. "Lab rats don't fall  |
|in love" explains Eric J. Nestler, the Elizabeth Mears and     |
|House Jameson Associate Professor of Psychiatry and            |
|Pharmacology. "There's no appropriate animal model, and it's   |
|difficult enough to look at normal human physiology, let alone |
|at some subjective human emotion."                             |
|As a psychologist, Sternberg works the middle ground between an|
|approach that would reduce amour to a wiring diagram and a     |
|collection of chemicals, and one that looks for universal, but |
|fuzzier truths. The psychologist's research into an area that  |
|some feel can't be-or, at least, ought not to be-examined      |
|scientifically, is, in part, an offshoot of his landmark       |
|studies of human intelligence, including The Triarchic Mind: A |
|New Theory of Human Intelligence, published in 1988. Those     |
|studies led him to argue that traditional iq tests are not     |
|accurate predictors of later career success because they do not|
|take into account such intangible assets as creativity and     |
|"street smarts." (He has since developed an alternative test   |
|that attempts to do that.) "I'm interested in things that are  |
|central to people's lives," he says. "Love is certainly the    |
|thing we crave the most and have the most trouble getting, and |
|love also involves a kind of intelligence."                    |
|When Sternberg started examining love relationships, in the    |
|1970s, he discovered that ideally each had three major         |
|components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. Taken together, |
|the three formed the sides of a triangle, which, when love was |
|mature and balanced, would be of the equilateral variety. And  |
|as love grew, so would the triangle's area, with the three     |
|equal sides lengthening in equal measure. When a couple is in  |
|geometric harmony, the result is what Sternberg calls          |
|consummate love.                                               |
|Of course, such a blissful state is rare. All too often, the   |
|sides of the triangle are mismatched, and many times, one of   |
|the critical components is missing altogether. There is, for   |
|example, infatuation-passion without intimacy or               |
|commitment-along with romantic love-intimacy and passion, but  |
|no commitment-and fatuous love-commitment and passion with no  |
|intimacy. There are other possibilities as well, notes         |
|Sternberg, who has explored his triangular theory of love in   |
|several books and numerous scientific papers."Having compatible|
|triangles matters," says Sternberg. "If one person, say, wants |
|intimacy, and the other person is a distancer, that            |
|relationship may be intriguing for a while, but then it gets   |
|frustrating. Similarly, if one partner feels commitment is     |
|important, and the other person is seeing people all over the  |
|place, that gets tiresome."                                    |
|Another Yale researcher, psychologist Kelly Brownell, has found|
|Sternberg's triangular theory useful as a framework for        |
|examining the shape and building blocks of love. In his popular|
|course on human sexuality and intimate relationships, Brownell |
|teaches amour Ã  la Sternberg. "It's pretty much the dominant   |
|theory," Brownell explains.                                    |
|But dominant or not, several years ago, Sternberg realized that|
|it left a key question unanswered. "The triangular theory tells|
|you, almost geometrically, where you are. It doesn't say how   |
|you got there," he says. "If you really want to understand     |
|love, you have to look at how it develops and evolves."        |
|You have to look at stories.                                   |
|"The story is who you are," says Sternberg, adding that such   |
|lifetime tales are crafted from a wide variety of disparate    |
|elements: family experiences, religion, school, watching       |
|television and movies, reading, culture in general, and time in|
|the back seat, to name some of the more obvious inputs. "And   |
|it's never completed," he says. "Your personal story is very   |
|dynamic."                                                      |
|Although everyone's personal narrative is as individual as a   |
|fingerprint, Sternberg, by analyzing the thousands of detailed |
|questionnaires he's distributed in the course of nearly 20     |
|years of studying love, has learned that the tales can be      |
|grouped into roughly two dozen fundamental categories. Along   |
|with the hearts-and-flowers romance, there is what he calls the|
|police story, the mystery, the gardening tale, and the         |
|pornographic essay. There are humorous stories, with one       |
|partner cast as Johnny Carson and the other playing Ed McMahon,|
|and there are science fiction thrillers in which the plot line |
|calls for a person to team up with someone who seems to be as  |
|incomprehensible and strange as an alien from another planet.  |
|Some tales are pure Erich Segal; others might have been written|
|by Franz Kafka-or Stephen King.                                |
|Only by understanding one's personal literature, says          |
|Sternberg, can a person find a suitable coauthor for an amorous|
|tale. "You have to know your own story," he says, "and it has  |
|to mesh with your partner's story."                            |
|The psychologist has dubbed one of the fundamental tales "love |
|is an addiction," and like all of the narratives, there are two|
|roles. "The partner who's telling this story needs a mate the  |
|way an addict might need cigarettes or drugs, and when he or   |
|she finds someone, there's an actual high," says Sternberg,    |
|pointing out that such a tale can easily become a tragedy. "If |
|the partner doesn't need to feel needed all the time, there's a|
|risk of suffocation."                                          |
|Then there's the war story. "You see a couple that's always    |
|fighting, and an outsider might wonder, 'what are they doing   |
|together?' Well, it works because to them, love is war," says  |
|Sternberg, adding that such a match wouldn't succeed if a      |
|"Rambo" attempted a long-term liaison with someone whose story |
|was akin to Romeo and Juliet.                                  |
|"A story isn't necessarily good or bad," says Sternberg. "The  |
|important thing in determining the outcome of a relationship is|
|finding someone who fits in as a character in the story you    |
|feel comfortable writing." Even so, some forms of interpersonal|
|literature are more likely to succeed than others. A couple    |
|may, for instance, be involved in a "love as a fantasy" story, |
|which has one partner expecting a knight in shining armor and  |
|the other looking for a princess to save. There are advantages |
|to this way of seeing a relationship-admiration and respect for|
|each person, and a willingness to walk the extra mile to keep  |
|the knight or the princess happy. But coupled with the plus    |
|side is a potentially fatal flaw, for reality rarely lives up  |
|to anyone's fantasies for long. Unless the participants in this|
|story can temper their expectations, the likelihood of the     |
|union's lasting is poor, says Sternberg.                       |
|On the other hand, those writing narratives that portray love  |
|as gardening, sewing and knitting, or travel have an           |
|"excellent" chance to succeed. Gardeners, says Sternberg, are  |
|forever nurturing their partner and the relationship (the      |
|danger here is overwatering). Knitters continually create and  |
|recreate the pattern of their love lives (and only run into    |
|trouble when they can't agree on the pattern). Travelers see   |
|love as a journey both partners plan and enjoy (a surefire     |
|outlook as long as neither has a change in direction).         |
|Sternberg is quick to point out that the story idea is not     |
|astrology dressed up in psychological costume. "The acid test  |
|is whether or not a theory predicts behavior," he says. "My    |
|astrological sign happens to be Sagittarius, and as near as I  |
|can tell, it has no influence on who I am. But stories are of  |
|great interest to psychologists because they can predict,      |
|explain, and help us understand what people will do and why    |
|they do it. "                                                  |
|One might expect to find an almost ideal source of material in |
|that search in Yale's pool of 5,000 undergraduates. But when it|
|comes to matters of the heart, Sternberg reports, students make|
|disappointing subjects. Most of their stories turn out to be   |
|short ones. "It's a sign of a low commitment to long-term      |
|relationships, which is about what you'd expect on a college   |
|campus," he says.                                              |
|An impromptu survey conducted last fall during Kelly Brownell's|
|psychology course confirmed Sternberg's impressions. Brownell  |
|posed the following question to the 200 undergraduates         |
|attending his lecture: "Is Yale a good place in which to fall  |
|in love?" Their answer was a resounding "No!"                  |
|Brownell, who in his class routinely brought up personal issues|
|for discussion-and received surprisingly frank answers-used the|
|responses to the love query as a springboard to a freewheeling |
|exploration of topics including fear of feminism, the effects  |
|of stress on desire, and performance anxiety. Throughout, he   |
|was low-key, nonjudgmental, authoritative, and warmly          |
|reassuring. He never blushed (a result, he explained, of his   |
|work as a sex therapist).                                      |
|"There's no part of a person's life that's more important than |
|intimate relationships," says Brownell, accounting for his     |
|course's popularity (400 people showed up to vie for the 200   |
|seats). "We explore issues that are personally relevant, as    |
|well as intellectually interesting."                           |
|As to why the students in the class were living lives more akin|
|to monastic, or, at best, platonic ideals than to those of     |
|collegiate hedonism, there were complaints about too much work,|
|too little time, an overabundance of cynicism, too few social  |
|skills, and a pervasive perfectionism that precludes the       |
|give-and-take that is usually necessary for a relationship to  |
|develop and thrive.                                            |
|All of these may be true, says Hope Royston, an Ezra Stiles    |
|sophomore, but she feels the main reason for the oft-noted     |
|dearth of romance on campus is a basic fear of rejection. "Love|
|is a personal thing-and a risky one," she says. "You're putting|
|yourself on the line, and there's just not a lot of personal   |
|risk-taking here. Failing at love is very different from       |
|failing a test." Accordingly, most students seem to avoid the  |
|issue and instead pursue goals that are within an individual's |
|ability to accomplish: academic and athletic success, or       |
|achievements in any number of extracurricular activities.      |
|But instead of interpreting the lack as grounds for despair    |
|about the fate of the upcoming generation, Sternberg explains  |
|that the avoidance of commitment can be seen as an encouraging |
|sign of intelligence and maturity. "When you're between 18 and |
|22, you don't really know who you're going to become, and the  |
|kind of relationship that might work on a long-term basis is   |
|not yet clear," he says. "You can look at it as being          |
|realistic." His hope is that when they get ready to settle     |
|down, the question they ask a potential partner won't be,      |
|"What's your sign?" but rather, "What's your story?"           |
