            <p>Notes: Among the many types of intelligence that human beings possess, interpersonal intelligence is an important type of understanding that is often downplayed and overlooked. Yet, an understanding of others through empathy and psychological tools is often not practiced, resulting in much conflict and frustration that can be avoided by acknowledging and appreciating differences in the world. This section of the mentor handbook explores the concept of interpersonal intelligence and how it can be developed and used to solve many problems when interacting with others at work, in relationships, and in dealing with others. The topics of love, understanding, and empathy &amp; their relationship to interpersonal intelligence are also explored. The section ends with a discussion on how interpersonal intelligence can be developed and used in daily life.</p>
