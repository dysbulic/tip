    <h1>Mentor Handbook Preface</h1>
    <p>There was a study recently on littering. Researchers went through a parking lot putting fliers on the windows of all the cars. They then hid in the bushes and waited to see what people did with the fliers once they found them. They repeated the study a few times with varying amounts of garbage scattered in the surrounding area. Not terribly surprisingly the more garbage there was lying about, the more likely people were to add to the clutter.</p>
    <p>The study is generally cited in public health and administration as an example of how people use their environment to decide what is acceptable. The study of how groups of people and cultures affect the things people do. That coin has another side though: instead of looking at the forest, we can look at the trees and ask, "what was different about those people that didn't litter even when everyone around them was?"</p>
    <p>There are two main groups in the business of saying why people do things: religions and psychologists. There are quite a few opinons on human nature out there. People are clearly complex beasts with lots of different motivations and coming up with a simple solution is a daunting task. There are however common themes in many of these opinions and researchers are suggesting that there are not only similarities in the ways people are affected by their experiences, but that there are also patterns in the paths people take in developing.</p>
    <p>These opinons are frequently not popular. When you start discussing morality and saying that Bob's moral structure is more advanced and better that Ralph's, Ralph and his like-minded friends are likely to feel insulted. In spite of this, it is very possible that these trends do exist and in this modern world where humankind's technology is agruably outstipping its soul, understanding and trying to apply these patterns is becoming increasingly important.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this book is not to provide the reader with a magical Truth that will transform their lives and make every day smell of roses. It presents some ideas &mdash; frequently expressed through the words of philosophers, saints, and scientists &mdash; that are useful in understanding why people do the things they do.</p>
    <p>People learn to add. Learn to think&hellip;</p>
