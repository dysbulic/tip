    <h2>Slama in France, September 2002</h2>

    <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase">Final Report</h1>
    <h1>Health Intervention Support 2002</h1>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>

<p>This past fall, Friends of Mauritania (FORIM) was contacted by a
French family participating in a health intervention involving a young
boy named Slama from Mauritania. FORIM immediately recognized the
child because of FORIM's past involvement in his health care in 1999
and again in 2001. The French couple informed FORIM that Slama would
need to return to Paris in September of 2002 to undergo a major heart
operation, and was requesting on his behalf assistance for Slama's
travel expense.</p>

<p>After some discussion of if and how FORIM would assist, the acting
board of FORIM decided to consider other options of support a/o
provide the needed resources for a plane ticket. If another source of
support could not be found, FORIM private resources were approved for
use in this intervention. The most obvious measure for obtaining this
support was through the local Air France office. FORIM communicated
the difficult situation to Air France in Washington DC and formally
requested their assistance in this matter. Unfortunately, they were
not able to help in this special case, citing lack of resources. FORIM
came into contact with a former PCV of Mauritania. Tracy became
interested in the effort and offered her frequent flyer miles for
Slama, which then enabled FORIM to organize the details for his travel
to Paris. The French couple introduced FORIM to Slama's uncle, a
university teacher of mechanics in Nouakchott, who picked-up the plane
ticket from the local airlines bureau and ensured Slama's departure
from Mauritania. The French couple, Mecenat, Slama's uncle in
Mauritania, Tracy, and FORIM were all facilitators in this scheme to
send Slama to France for his medical exam and potentially to receive
heart surgery. All parties demonstrated the utmost care and interest
in carrying off this aspect of the plan in the most efficient manner.
FORIM is relieved and satisfied with the results of the intervention
and appreciates the cooperative effort that has established new
ties.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>In conjunction with Tracy, FORIM coordinated Slama's flight to and
from Paris. He reached Paris on the 8<sup>th</sup> of September, and
was picked-up by his host family. As scheduled, Slama went to the
M&eacute;cenat facility for his examination. M&eacute;cenat<a
href="#ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> is an international child's healthcare
organization that provides medical services such as valve transplant
surgery to children in need. M&eacute;cenat has been involved with the
stabilization of Slama's health for at least the past four years. Dr.
L. at M&eacute;cenat is Slama's doctor and is the person who first
diagnosed Slama when she visited Mauritania a couple of years ago. Dr.
L at M&eacute;cenat determined that Slama did not require the heart
operation that was originally planned for this year. To everyone's
relief, Slama was allowed to return back to his home in Mauritania.
Slama returned to home on September 17<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>FORIM was pleased to hear that Slama was keeping good health in
Mauritania. He would not require the valve operation this year, but
may be considered for it next year. His health condition is still far
from normal. The host family recommended that he reside in Nouakchott
in case his health deteriorates and something could be done in
response. They mentioned that they are working with another young boy
in Mali who successfully received a valve transplant and was doing
well living near the capital city.</p>

<h2>Budget</h2>

<p>The transportation budget of this health intervention is estimated
to be $1,008.55. FORIM's contribution of $40 was used to prepare and
fax the necessary airline documents to Slama's uncle in Nouakchott and
to the airline carrier in France. Copies of these documents will
remain with Julei. Tracy's total contribution is estimated to be
$968.55.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In retrospect, the decision to be involved in this intervention in
the same role as before was a difficult decision for FORIM. Currently,
the organization suffering from lack of leadership and volunteer
participation. Its resources are extremely limited. FORIM has not
raised funds since 2000. Unlike many of FORIM's former projects, we
would not be able to monitor this activity directly through a NGO or
any other organization we worked with before. However, the host family
and their partner organization proved to be effective managers in the
past and FORIM's previous involvement in the child's healthcare drew
us to favorably support the cause again. Who knows what the situation
of the organization will be next year? </p>

<p>This health intervention also indicated to us that medical care in
Mauritania is not adequate and that there is significant difficulty in
accessing basic care from peoples' home regions. Slama's home is over
600 km from the capital and there is no telephone nearby. His health
problems stemmed from a respiratory illness that increased in severity
without proper treatment. Slama's case is not alone. 12% of children
under five years of age in Mauritania were estimated to suffer from
acute respiratory infection (at the time of the Pan Arab Project for
Child Development, 1991). Throughout the world, approximately two
million children under the age of five die from this type of illness.
Facilities that manage particular health complications are not as
available in most regions outside the big cities. The low ratio of
physicians and nurses, 13 and 62, respectively, (in 1998) per 100,000
people also indicate a severe deficiency in the capacity of the health
system to extend proper coverage and develop their own system to
handle special cases.</p>

<p>Per correspondence with the French family, M&eacute;cenat assessed
the medical facilities in Nouakchott to not be sufficiently capable of
handling such cardiac cases as Slama's or of providing basic blood
analysis in an accurate manner. Dr. L recommends that Slama not rely
on blood work or care from facilities in Nouakchott. I suspect there
may be other factors that determined this recommendation, however no
other explanation for why the stateside facilities were inadequate was
noted. After operation in France, Slama would need to follow an
aspirine-based medication schedule with check-ups in France every two
years. The French couple mentioned that another boy Mohamed traveled
with Slama from Mauritania to Paris to also receive a heart operation.
Unfortunately, he did not survive the operation and naturally, there
is a real sense of loss. Children must be protected at least from the
treatable diseases that are prevalent in the region due to the
climate, air, and public health hazards that are known to exist. The
matter of how to ensure this protection seems to be difficult to
address considering the means of information dissemination and
populations that are far from medical care facilities.</p>

<p>Perhaps our dollars should go toward improving medical technology
and improving facilities in Mauritania that detect and care for
children with such health complications and improve the quality of
basic services. This sort of action will aim to achieve greater impact
on a larger number of people and influence a more sustainable system
that may raise the standard of care services provided. However,
considering the level of financial support needed for such an endeavor
and the research required, FORIM is not in a position to take on such
development work. Future support for specific individual cases may be
possible pending other sources of income that FORIM receives.</p>
