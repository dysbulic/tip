    <p>Dear Peace Corps Partners:</p>

<p>Greetings and Salutations from Kankossa, Mauritania.  I hope you have
had a pleasant summer.  Sarah Swert, the preceding coordinator, successfully
completed her service with the Peace Corps and asked me if I could  take
her place as coordinator for the project.  My name is Tre Kraut and I am
happy to say everything is moving along smoothly.</p>

<p>Sarah introduced me to Mohamed ould Valou, the President of the Parents'
Association.  He is collecting the money for the school's contribution.
 But since school was out and people went on vacation, he is not finished
yet.  He guarantees that all the money will have been collected before the
desks are finished, &quot;In-Shalla.&quot;</p>

<p>We received the funding for the project in September and ordered the
desks.</p>

<p>We paid 50% of the total cost so that the welders cooperative could purchase
the materials.  I recently visited the cooperative and they informed me
that all the materials were purchased and they have already started the
production. </p>

<p>School starts on the 20th of October and we hope to have the desks by
the first week of November.  The kids are excited to start school and will
be more excited when they have their desks.  If everything stays on track
my next correspondence will address the completion of the project and I
will send pictures. Thank you for thinking of this community, your donation
will go to  great use in educating future generations.</p>

  <div>Sincerely yours,</div>
