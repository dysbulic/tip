    <p>Dear Peace Corps Partners,</p>

<p>On behalf of Peace Corps Mauritania and the town of Kankossa, I would
like to thank you for your participation as a Peace Corps Partner.  It is
impossible to describe the excitement that the children, teachers and community
feel as they are preparing for the project.  Your contribution is greatly
appreciated and will be fondly remembered by all involved.</p>

<p>Your contribution will help to purchase eighty student school desks,
seven teachers' desks, and eight teachers' chairs for &quot;Ecole Deux&quot;
in Kankossa.  This equipment will benefit 290 primary school students (ages
6 to 13) and seven teachers.  Along with your donation, the school is contributing
twenty-five percent of the total monetary cost.  This money, 142,800 ougiyas
(approximately 730 USD), is being funded through a collection taken by the
Parents' Association.  The Parents' Association has collected nearly all
the money, which emphasizes the importance the school places on this project.
 The school year has just ended and as the completion time for the desks
is two months, we plan to welcome the students back in August with the new
desks!</p>

<p>Once again, I thank you as this project would not have been possible
without your generous support.  We look forward to staying in contact with
you and hope that a cultural exchange is possible between us.  Any correspondence
is welcome and we will be sending photos and updated information shortly.</p>

<div class="closing">
  <div>Sincerely yours,</div>
  <div>Sarah Swert</div>
