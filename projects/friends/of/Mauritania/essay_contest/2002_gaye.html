    <h1>If You Were the Minister of Rural Development, What Would Be Your Priority Activities in Mauritania?</h1>
    <h2>by Awa Gaye</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">Mauritania is a Saharian country located in the North-West 
of Africa. The country is entirely covered by the desert; that is why its 
climate is a desertic one, Sahelian in the South and Saharian in the North. 
Independent since November 28<sup>th</sup>, 1960, Mauritania has a surface of 
1,030,700 square kilometres and a population about 2,418,506 inhabitants. 
Mauritania has known since its independence some serious problems caused by the 
long period of drought of the year 1970 and the extension of the desert which 
invades all cities in the country. So, Mauritania suffers since the 70s from 
these phenomenons which affect its development. In that way, helping Mauritania 
to go outside these problems would be a difficult task that will take years of 
projects. Mauritania, which is a developing country should have some ways to get 
out of these terrible phenomenons. Aiming to help our country to develop, as a 
Rural Development Minister, we will focus our work first, in the environmental 
level, after in the farming level, next in the social level, and finally in the 
economical level.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the environmental level, the struggles against 
desertification in the country would be an important thing that would have some 
positive effects. The extension of the desert or desertification is generalized 
in the country, the situation is dramatic, the desert continues its progression 
encouraged by the lack of forests. To solve the problem of desertification would 
be a difficult one because it is the factor of all the recent problems that 
rural populations are confronted today. So, to struggle against this phenomenon 
we have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plant trees to fix the sand dunes, it covers day after day many available lands and roads.</li>
  <li>Make in each village one gas stop and coalman to decrease the wood consumption because women used to go through the desert in search of woods, for the preparation of their meal, that come from trees.</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">The struggle against the drought is also important. In 
fact, the lack of rain is a natural phenomenon that consists a handicap in our 
country. Only the areas that are in the South receive rains which are not enough 
for the rural people because the cultivation of land that is the main activity 
of rural people should absorb lots of water from the sky. Guidimakha is the only 
region that we can say receive enough water because it is located in the extreme 
south of Mauritania. Sometimes we can see an area without any drop of water all 
the year. So, this is a catastrophic thing for rural people, but we are not able 
to change the natural climate. What we can do for these people is:</p>

<ul>
<li>To drill several bare holes so that countryside people get water for them, their livestock and cultivations.</li>
<li>To increase barrages</li>
<li>To avoid famine: In fact, the drought is usually accompanied with a famine. So, solving the problem of famine would be a long fight, but it would help these populations to say in their localities. Something has to be done to help these people who suffer sometimes in the drought period such as:
<ul>
  <li>Helping people to maintain their livestock in order to sell them at a good price.</li>
  <li>Reducing the cost of living because countryside people have not enough money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">In a famine period, the cities around the villages should 
help these villages with food and medicine. The government has to do its best to 
convince these people. However, the environmental education is an interesting 
matter that should be taught to children in schools all over the country. 
Mauritania is facing environmental problems associated with fragile ecosystems 
namely desertification and drought. So, an environmental education programme 
would be very important in sensitizing Mauritanian youth on ecosystem problems 
and commit themselves to environmental protection actions. Old people also have 
to be sensitized by their children who are educated children that can talk about 
the environmental protection and the preservation of natural resources. The 
youth and parents sensitizing should be done in the whole country without any 
exceptions because the youth who are going to be sensitizing will become one day 
leaders of their country; in that case they will take care of the environment. 
Although some activities have to be taken in the environmental level, we should 
not neglect the farming level.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the farming level, lots of activities have to be done to 
improve the situation of farmers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modern tools should be at the farmers' disposal to improve their activities at the field level</li>
  <li>Lands should be given to those who want it.</li>
  <li>Some arrangement should be taken to fight against birds, grasshoppers, and some animals that destroy fields.</li>
  <li>Measures should be also taken to avoid the cattle theft.</li>
  <li>Each village should have one or two veterinarian(s) to take care of livestock.</li>
  <li>Plenty of water must be found.</li>
  <li>Laboratories must be multiplied to analyze livestock and their milk.</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">So, at the farming level we have to focus our activities on 
all these things to make the countryside people and urbanites' life proud of 
their country and consolidate the relations between villages and cities. In that 
way, the development of farming can be seen as a way to develop your own country 
because this is one of the main activities that a country can base to be 
developed even if this development will take years of activities. Similarly, we 
have to take priority in the rural society also.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the level of society we should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help villagers to stay in their localities of origin because since the 1970s drought, villagers do not stay anymore in their villages, they come to the cities in the search of food and water. That's why the capital city, Nouakchott is becoming more and more populated; it is also the case of Nouadhibou or Kaèdi. These displacements from the village to the city and the city to the village are called rural exodus, only improvement of conditions of life in villages can settle down these young people.</li>
  <li>Develop the education. Classes must be created to welcome a big number of students, but also with a library for children. In fact, rural people take a lot of importance in the traditional education or Coranic education. Today many people have children that are in these schools we called it "Mahadra" but, we want to show them that both modern and traditional education can go together so, they have to enroll their children in modern schools to give a chance to their kids hence we must sensitize parents.</li>
  <li>Introduce water and electricity in villages so that populations will drink water without any danger and dispose some ways of communication like radio and television.</li>
  <li>Create health centers and pharmacies, but also to help people to access medicine with the little money they have.</li>
  <li>Reduce women's responsibilities because the drought, the deterioration of the environment, the men's exodus increased their responsibilities. For the women we should:
  <ul>
    <li>Give them freedom and solve the problems of inequalities between men and women in giving to women the same rights as men.</li>
    <li>To sensitize women in some diseases. As in the social level, the economical one would be a way to help the villagers to invest in banks for their own good. The creation of one small bank in each village for villagers would be a positive one. To help populations to sell their cattle and their cultivations at a good price that will be an advantage for them and customers.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>To reduce taxes and grains price.</li>
  <li>To increase the production.</li>
  <li>To make the best cultivation qualities.</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">In basing in our activities in these plans, we think that 
our country will have some changes and also villagers will be proud of the 
government and proud of being in their own village and working for serving the 
whole population.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, we noticed that the plans of the activities we 
wanted to do and to create in the rural area to provide its development are very 
interesting. We noticed that all these things can not be done at the same time, 
but we have to take care of all the problems that rural people are facing and 
begin to try to give some solutions even if it will cost lots of money and take 
many years of work. To solve rural problems is to solve the problems of the 
country because the country can not be developed if the rural areas have so many 
problems that consist a handicap in their life. A city can not develop without 
the support of villagers. The question we wander is how to find money to finance 
all these plans. </p>
