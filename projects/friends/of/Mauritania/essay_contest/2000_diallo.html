    <h1>Traditional Values vs. Modern Concepts</h1>
    <h2>by Mamadou Lamine Diallo</h2>

<p>Centuries in the past, societies existed. Human beings are the creatures endowed with
reason. Wherever there is society, people set up rules with which society was organized
and the ways of living. These sets of rules and ways are called values. As a matter of
fact, to put these values in clear and specific context, people who lived according to
those past values are called traditionalists. Those traditional values were well
considered and they played fundamental roles within traditional societies. In the last
hundred years, knowledge in science and technology has greatly increased. Since they came
with their own methods of discovering and accepting truth, science and technology compared
to traditional values, are new knowledge or modern concepts. As a result, two blocs were
born within the societies: a bloc favoring traditional values, and a bloc favoring modern
concepts. Furthermore, there questions are raised? Is there any reason for the two blocs
to be so opposite? Isn&#146;t it possible to find a room for improvement in order to make
these two so-called opposite sides get on well by bringing them into being complementing
each other?</p>

<p>Wherever a society is established, there is a number of ideas that govern it.
Historically, people in the past lived according to values which were inherent to them. As
there is need to qualify these values, the word <i>values</i> goes along with tradition -
related to the past customs. Traditional values played fundamental roles in the
traditional societies. </p>

<p>Social role: societies were organized with traditional values. Education of children
was based on traditional and moral values. Good behavior was apparent in every member of
the society. Families lived according to traditional values. People did not resort so
frequently to divorce. Old people were considered as the detainers of the traditional
values. Honor and respect were given to them; so, they had great prestige in the society.
The palaber-trees they used to organize was fruitful. Young people acquired moral and
traditional values; moral, spiritual, and traditional teaching were learnt by young
people. That is why a famous Malian writer, Amadou Hampaté Bâ said that &quot;an older
man who dies in a library which is burnt.&quot; Whatever happened within the society, old
people were consulted. Their ideas opinions, and advice were acquired and applied at
anytime.</p>

<p>Economic: Even though there were not means like machines and advanced technology, the
society was flourishing. Work was considered as a value in the society. People learnt to
be hard-workers. Mutual help was apparent in the society, particularly in the families.
Selfish men were denied among people, they helped each other. As they were the products of
their society, people were useful for the whole society.</p>

<p>If we take the case of Africa, there is no doubt that before colonialism, the African
society was organized and based on traditional values. The land was rich; and people used
their traditional means and values to exploit the soil. So they were self-sufficient in
life with a high standard of living according to traditional values.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Europe is also an example. The Industrial Revolution got its roots from agriculture.
    Before there were not advanced science and technology; in fact, those people used
    primitive and traditional means and tools to develop their society.</li>
  <li>America for instance is a case in point. Historically, the first settlers, Puritans, and
    other religious groups were living with reference to strong traditional and moral values.
    They came to develop the land of the New World (America) that is today superpower of the
    world.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in the last hundred years, knowledge in science and technology has greatly
increased. As there are new knowledge and they touch people&#146;s many field&#146;s in
life, science and technology could not fail to have influenced traditional values.
Traditionalist people, especially older people, did not welcome massively the birth and
coming of science and technology. Young people, who have not plunged yet in the
traditional values, have massively embraced science and technology considered as modern
concepts. Modern concepts refer to a life dominated by science and technology which have
shaped partly man&#146;s way of living, thinking, behaving and so on. Accordingly, the
different sides appeared within societies: Traditional values versus modern concepts.</p>

<p>Modern concepts were seen as threats to traditional values. In modern concepts,
priorities are given to science and technology. Science and technology dictate ways of
living, thinking, behaving, speaking. There is today, development of the means of
communication and machines. In many men&#146;s fields, machines replace men. Development
of science and technology has given birth to materialism and capitalism which favor the
research for economic growth and freedom of men. Consequently, no spiritual, moral, and
traditional values are taken into account.</p>

<p>Moreover, both traditional and modern concepts can be in the same room. They aim to
raise the standard of living of the society and to develop it. Used constructively and
relatively, they won&#146;t have any reason to be opposite. A Senegalese writer, Cheikh
Hamidou Kane said that there is need for people to benefit from modern knowledge in order
&quot;to learn how to bind words together,&quot; which means to cultivate oneself with the
mix of the two cultures. Today, with globalization, there is no reason for cultures and
values to keep away from each other. Everything will be globalized; and no one can prevent
things from getting globalized.</p>

<p>In short, traditional values played fundamental roles in the societies. Science and
technology, which gave birth to modern concepts, soured the conflict between traditional
values and modern concepts. But they have also widened our vision and understanding of the
world. Both traditional and modern concepts were seen as opposite because of
misunderstanding and misconception. Nowadays, used constructively, positively, and
selectively, traditional values and modern will cease to become enemies and will also
become people&#146;s panacea.</p>
