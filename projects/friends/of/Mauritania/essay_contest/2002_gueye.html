    <h1>What Do You See as the Role of Women in Mauritania's Social and Economic Development?</h1>
    <h2>by Nar Gueye</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">Women in Mauritania always played a considerable role in 
the economic and social activities of the nation. Her activities never lack 
importance in all fringes of society. For example, the rearing of the children, 
which is the major task confronting our women is really a difficult work and an 
enormous responsibility. But, in spite of this, women's activities have always 
been considered as secondary ones. This outcasting of women and the roles 
assigned to them can be explained by a lack of maturity of the society itself. 
This society has always underestimated women's activities and considered them as 
a nonproductive element. Even though, all the development or attempt of 
cultural, economic, or social blooming passes inevitably by women who constitute 
a vital and interesting element of the society. In the following lines, we will 
try to show you what are the roles of women in social and economic development.</p>

<h3>The Role of Women in Social Development</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">The role of women in social development is real important 
in the traditional society, as well as it is the case today, has represented the 
central heart of the family. She is interested in solving all the family 
problems; and she always tries to satisfy all the members of the family. It 
should be said aloud that this is not an easy responsibility, because the family 
is in our society, as well as in all the African societies, is very extended: 
the father, the mother, the children, the cousins, the relatives, etc.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to that, woman is obliged to play roles that 
are so hard that she does not posses physical or physiological capacities to 
carry them out. Though, she always tries hard to make her family have good 
living standards. The normal status of the head of the family, that of a man who 
is able to protect his family and meet all its needs is vanishing. In fact some 
investigations made upon this subject show that the number of women who are 
heads of families is in perpetual growth. All what has been mentioned above is 
to show how important woman is in the family and in the society. Women in the 
traditional society were ready to cooperate with men; but this wish did not 
attract anyone's attention. They have been unfortunately, associated with roles 
of: motherhood, wife, teacher, servant, etc. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In spite of all that, the importance of woman's roles in 
the traditional society remains cardinal. She has always stood beside man, ready 
to help him in the achievement of his works, especially in agriculture and 
livestock. Moreover, woman takes care of children from their birth until the age 
of seven or more. She has also seemed to be uniquely responsible in their 
education. With regards to rural works, one can say that woman plays an 
important role. She always participates in farming works and the trade of farm 
products.</p>

<h3>The Women in the Economic Level: Their Role</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">The traditional economy of Mauritania was based on 
agriculture and livestock. Within these fields, woman's role is considered to be 
a primary one. Even though, traditional considerations have underestimated it 
and have represented it as a subsidiary role because it belongs to a weak being.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Women's contributions have been greatly considerable and 
almost the whole society could have benefited from them. The improvement of the 
social and family welfare was not possible had it not been women's productive 
activities. The latter do not stick to household alone, but they have been 
extended to other areas. Once domestic works are over, the woman usually joins 
her husband as the farm to help him. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Traditional woman practices a small trade within her 
hostel, which permits the family to overcome some economic difficulties, 
especially at the moment of eventual crises. In contrast to what was always 
believed, women participate greatly in the management of economy. In our 
society, women organize themselves in small groups, establishing traditional 
cooperatives known as <i>towniyas</i>. All members of this group work together 
manufacturing mats, tents, and making leather products.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is then to be noticed that woman's role on the economic 
level is very critical, and it has guaranteed the survival of the society. But, 
unfortunately, this role has always been considered as a secondary one. As a 
matter of fact, this persistence of some mentalities refused to woman her status 
of being able to contribute in a vital manner, in the improvement of the 
society's living standard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Despite any consideration, woman has played a very 
important role on the social and economic level. But, the discriminatory 
attitudes have presented woman's roles as nonproductive ones, just for the 
reason that they are achieved by a woman. This really constitutes one of the 
biggest handicaps facing woman's participation in the economic blooming, hence 
the nation build up and development. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In conclusion, the development of the country is not 
possible without the contribution of women who are the roots of her society.</p>
