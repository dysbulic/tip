    <h1>Describe a Person Who Has Had a Big Impact on Your Life</h1>
    <h2>by Lemrabott Ould Moilid</h2>

    <p>Albert Wheeler grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, in a
    neighborhood of working class families on the outskirts of town.
    Black and white, they were all poor. This early environment was an
    important influence, he says. "Just seeing people around me who
    didn't get very far in our society made a deep impression. Wanting
    to get out of that bag of poverty was something that was ground
    into me early."</p>

    <p>Wheeler grew up in an extended family. His parents shared a
    house with his mother's parents, and other relatives were in close
    contact, Wheeler remembers his family as less contented with their
    lot than most of the black families in the neighborhood. They
    didn't like what they had or didn't have. They had the idea that
    the only way to get out of that bag of poverty was education. The
    oldest child, Wheeler was the active and industrious type, who
    loved both sports and reading. Segregated schools had one
    important benefit for black people: they had black teachers who
    were important role models for children growing up. Black children
    here in Ann Arbor, Wheeler commented, had no such models until the
    first black teacher was hired in the middle of the '50s.
    Wheeler's aunt was a school teacher, and he moved in with her and
    his other grandmother in order to go to a better junior high
    school. He participated with relish in virtually all sports in
    high school, was on the student council, and finished at age 16 at
    the head of his class. The neighbor was named Rev. Branch. He had
    been impressed by Wheeler's industry doing odd jobs and mowing
    lawns. Branch was also aware of Wheeler's academic success. One
    day near the time he was to graduate from high school, Branch
    asked Wheeler what his plans were. Wheeler was able to tell him
    with pride that he already had a good job lined up; he was going
    to be a dispatcher in a black cab company. Branch encouraged
    Wheeler to continue his education, even though they were in the
    thick of the Depression. Having graduated from Lincoln College in
    Pennsylvania, he suggested Wheeler apply there. Wheeler was not
    only accepted and given a partial scholarship, but was given a
    $100 bonus for being the school's first student from Missouri.
    Wheeler majored in biology at Lincoln College. As graduation drew
    near, he was not sure what his next step would be. Once again,
    Branch back in St. Louis made a timely intervention. Branch had a
    regular summer visitor, Dr. Lawrence Foster, who had a doctorate
    in political science and taught in college. They both listened
    when Wheeler talked about his career ambitions that he was never
    really hung about medical school, although he had a deep interest
    in the biological science. But he also felt a pull towards working
    with a large number of people rather than with individuals. His
    concerns were directed more to the community as a whole, Wheeler
    came to Ann Arbor to begin doctoral studies in the School of
    Public Health. There were between one hundred and two hundred
    black students at the university at the time, Wheeler remembers
    most of whom lived with black Ann Arbor families. Wheeler's
    graduate studies at Ann Arbor were pleasant on the whole, but
    there were experiences which left bitter memories. "Some
    professors seemed to go out of their way to make it clear to the
    whole class that Wheeler was somebody different from everyone
    else. One, for example, they had a laboratory assembly to observe
    experiment, several separate classes gathered together to observe.
    Before the experiment was to begin, the professor said that the
    room was getting crowded and pointed directly in the midst of the
    students to Wheeler as the one person who should leave to provide
    more room. That memory is still painful for him to recall.
    Wheeler's assignments as a graduate assistant seemed to him
    pointedly designed to keep him away from teaching or working with
    undergraduates. But still as he saw it, he was working earning
    enough money.</p>

    <p>Wheeler received his doctorate in Public Health and set about
    looking for a job either teaching in a university or working in a
    public health program. Finding a job in public health was not easy
    at that time for a young black professional. After many inquiries
    proved negative, Wheeler happened to discuss his situation with
    Dr. Reuben Kahn, who had been on his doctoral committee at
    Michigan. Kahn was by that time famous as the developer of the
    first widely used test for syphilis. He had an extensive
    laboratory in University Hospital. Kahn promptly hired Wheeler as
    a research associate for his own lab. Wheeler was to work with Dr.
    Kahn for the next eight years. He performed research to find a
    syphilis vaccine and to improve diagnostic tests. During this time
    he became increasingly frustrated that he was not given a full
    academic appointment by the university, despite his proven
    competence in his field. At age 37, he was appointed assistant
    professor in the Department of Microbiology and Dermatology. As
    far as he can determine, he was the first black to receive a full
    time appointment on the university faculty.</p>

    <p>Wheeler had met his wife, Emma, in the School of Public Health
    at Michigan, where she was obtaining her master's degree. They
    were married in 1938. Emma came from a very different background
    than Wheeler. She grew up in Columbia, South Carolina, where
    segregation was much more pointed than in St. Louis, and where
    blacks were subject to vastly greater amounts of abuse. Her
    background left her with even less tolerance for second school
    class citizenship than Wheeler had, and she was even more
    determined that they receive equal housing and employment
    opportunities. After getting his job at University Health, the
    Wheelers, who by then had three daughters, were in need of a home.
    Realtors showed them homes in traditionally black areas of town,
    but they found none of these adequate and started inquiries on
    their own. Eventually Wheeler found a colleague in his own
    department who was leaving town and about to put his house on the
    market. He agreed to sell his house on 8<sup>th</sup> Street to
    the Wheelers, who had to put up 40-50% of the down payment already
    saved up. But even with this substantial amount of cash, the
    Wheelers could find no financial institution in town from which
    they could obtain a mortgage.</p>

    <p>In summery Albert Wheeler is considered an outstanding black
    personage in America, that is for his political and social
    achievements, which left their impact on my life or many black
    students in now day.</p>
