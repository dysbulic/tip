    <h1>Have You Read a Book That Influenced You Deeply?</h1>
    <h2>by Douzi Fathi</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have read many books. These books influenced me but <cite>Animal Farm</cite>, George Orwell's book, is the only book that influenced me 
deeply and I will never forget it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is impossible to appreciate Orwell's work fully without 
understanding his political views. He was an outspoken anti-communist. He was 
also and ardent socialist all his life. The failure to distinguish between 
socialism and communism causes the confusion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Socialism refers generally to any economic system based on 
the ownership of goods and property collectively rather than by any individuals. 
Communism is a specific form of socialism, developed from principals laid down 
by Karl Marx and Frederic Engels; it always seeks the abolition of private 
property. Socialists seek to obtain the means of production by legal and 
peaceful means. Orwell was emphatic that improving man's physical conditions 
would not solve all man's problems. He believed that the most serious of these 
problems were not physical, but rather spiritual and psychological. But, he 
believed that these more serious problems could not be dealt with until man had 
conquered his material difficulties through socialism. Orwell was himself a 
sincere and courageous individualist, and he feared the loss of individual 
freedom that he knew socialism involved. He was honest enough, despite his 
awareness, to admit that he saw no other solution than socialism to the world's 
horrible material problems. He is often praised for his contribution to making 
people aware of the dangers of communism.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Totalitarianism, corruption, and power dirts were the 
central theses of <i>Animal Farm</i>. Our satire focuses on the way 
totalitarians govern the innocent public masses. In this satire Orwell drew his 
sole target, "How to get power from being abused." Orwell tried to clarify the 
tragedy of Man when governed by unconscious hungry leaders. He dramatized the 
situation of ordinary people loaded by strange ideals though they suffered very 
hard conditions under the leadership of charismatic dictators.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Reading between lines, we point out that Orwell focuses on 
the history of a revolution, which began full of promise, but how great the 
deception was. Though it had been written in the terms of beasts, <i>Animal Farm</i> 
was clearly a satire on the Soviet political experiment which had been corrupted 
by the selfish Bolchevik leaders whose lust for power made them withdraw into a 
posture of deviationism. Despite his severe attacks on communism, Orwell did not 
sympathize with Western liberalists, but focused on the role of writers who 
should bear the qualities of truth and honesty in their writings by clarifying 
to man, that his tragedy is the consequence of how he was led by opportunists 
whose sole purpose was to keep power on the behalf of the prevented large public 
masses. <i>Animal Farm</i> seems, in its reading, a fable story or a 
children-enjoying story, but is in fact a deepened critical political satire of 
communism which appeared in the post-World War I period.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Animal Farm</i> in the eyes of critics is considered the 
clearest satire on communism, though it had been a description of revolution, 
which took place in a Farm, we point out that the classification of the heroes 
of the Farm and the political speech of the animals refer to a very specific 
political regime. Thus, animals were classified according to many ideological 
and political reasons.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;"Animal hero, first class" was brought on the pigs and 
their followers such as Boxer, the hard-working horse, who showed a close 
dependence to the pig's will. "Animal hero, second class" was the status of the 
animals that were suspicious about the revolution and didn't show their will to 
defend their farm in the battle of the cowshed. Orwell said, "Power corrupts and 
absolute power corrupts absolutely." He also said, "Power may corrupt even those 
who exercise it." </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the very beginning of the animal government, the pigs 
drafted a series of clauses or "commandments" of animalism which were the 
constitution of the Farm. The most important among these commandments was "All 
Animals are Equal." This commandment may truly correspond to the promise of a 
"classless society" in the communist theory. Napoleon, the greatest hero in our 
satire corresponds to Stalin, who exercised direct powers and close supervision 
on the whole institutions of the Farm. Thus, he was considered as the 
unquestionable dictator. The other animals, except the pigs, were to carry on 
the orders carelessly without questioning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The cleverness of the pigs and their ability of conviction 
pushed them to base their politics on the speech group of wild dogs to keep 
peace in the Farm and these correspond to the "Secret Police" in Stalin's 
government.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Propaganda and revolutionary ideals had been used as a 
means in gaining public sympathy. Squealer, who was a spellbinding speaker, was 
used by Napoleon to convince the animals about the advantages they gained under 
Napoleon's ruling. Napoleon and his followers adopted a policy of isolationism 
in order to protest their revolution as the Communists did in Russia. They also 
aimed at mastering the group and establishing peace in the Farm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">"Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely." It 
is on the basis of this slogan that Orwell wrote his satire. The importance of 
this satire lies in the fact that is was written in terms of beasts, but it is 
in fact a deepened critical satire of Communism which influenced large members 
of European youth and intellectuals. The pigs took advantage of being 
brainworkers. They exercised all kinds of corruption; Napoleon became the 
undisputed leader. After the dismissal of Snowball, Napoleon and his followers 
exercised full control of the farm, the other animals had no choice but to 
agree. In short, Napoleon thought himself the wise leader whose policy is always 
right and his followers had to be obedient because they were a group of unwise 
animals, which had no choice but to accept the arrangements he set. Even his 
political speech had changed. We point out the use of the terms, "there will be 
no debate," order, "the pigs would meet in private. I have decided."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The situation was identical in Russia. No sooner had Stalin 
gained power that he had adopted a very serious policy in which power was 
concentrated in his hands. Like Stalin Napoleon had a very strong personality, 
that enabled him to control the situation. He was not so clever to be creative, 
but his sharp characteristics enabled him to take over someone else's ideas and 
plans and make them his own.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">These specific conditions contributed in the success of 
Napoleon in governing the Farm. His use of the dogs as his own guards brought 
among the animals a great feeling of fear. Orwell, in describing Napoleon, 
combines both Stalin and Hitler. His anti-totalitarian attitude helped him to be 
creative in describing Napoleon, concentrating even on the description of his 
features to convince his reader about the evil of Totalitarianists. The 
revolution in Manor Farm took its basis from old Major's speech calling for 
better living conditions of the animals under their own leadership. Major's 
speech was so idealistic the animals engaged in the rebellion in mass. This 
speech corresponds to Marx's the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> which called for a 
classless society in which the proletariat (the working class) would exercise 
its dictatorship and the means of protection would be shared in common. Major 
says: "Now comrades, what is the nature of this nature of ours? Let us face it, 
our lives are miserable, laborious and shortÂ…" These words had great impact on 
the general public.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The rebellion was not only to seize power but also called 
for a complete exercise of old Major's speech, especially the seven commandments 
which were democratic and idealized the nobility of the animals who are equal 
and comrades and whatever goes upon two legs represents cruelty and evil. The 
most intelligent members of the community were abusive to derive the 
revolutionary process. They exploited the simplicity and ignorance of the others 
in order to gain various advantages. Napoleon and the community of the pigs 
deviated the goal of the revolution and committed the most dangerous kinds of 
corruption and abuses. The animals, that were considered to have full 
citizenship rights, became no more than means of production. They have no choice 
but follow the orders of Napoleon whose many policies became a slogan. The 
animals wouldn't argue many of the arrangements that Napoleon had already put 
into practice. They've to work additional hours in order to improve the economic 
situation of the farm. The hens for example were obligated to lay more eggs. 
Despite the hard long hours of the work the animals were not well fed while the 
pigs stole the produce. The pigs were aware of the situation and Squealor with 
his ability of conviction spoke in the pubic, "We pigs are brainworkers. The 
whole management and organization of the farm depends on us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Squealor usually holds public meetings in which he explains 
to the animals that the pigs are the most bored ones in the farm because they 
are bearing heavy responsibilities. Apart from the things of which Squealor 
spoke, was the glorification of Napoleon's extra efforts to manage the farm in a 
democratic way. Even the exclusion of the public from making the political 
decisions, is a fear from Napoleon about the safety of the farm, Orwell 
explains: "Â…do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On the 
contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility.&nbsp; Â…We would be only to happy to 
let you make your decisions for yourselves, but sometimes you might make the 
wrong decision." We also notice that every arguing member is considered to be 
outlaw and an enemy of the revolution. This policy was adopted by Stalin during 
the early days of the Bolchevik regime which assassinated thousands of generals 
and statesmen who opposed many of Stalin's programs. We may mention that 
Napoleon, the central character of our satire kept around him a group of 
fierce-looking wild dogs. Napoleon tried to disperse among the general public a 
feeling of fear. The dogs were not only the bodyguards of Napoleon, but they 
used to exercise violence in the farm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In short, the concept of Animalism was no more than an 
ideological cover behind which the wild aims of the hungry pigs were hidden. 
Ordinary animals were promised to dominate the neighboring farms as were the 
"proletariat" promised to govern the world, whereas they had no power but carry 
out slogans. We can say that the pigs and the Bolcheviks had borne the funeral 
of communism together. The constitution of the farm took its roots from old 
Major's speech. This constitution is represented in the Seven Commandments. This 
draft included idealistic principles marveling at the honor and dignity of all 
animals. But the pigs that took the leadership of the farm abused the situation 
and made the commandments a sophisticated means for their profit as did the 
Bolchevik regime in Russia.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Bolchevik Revolution was not only against the 
capitalist economy and the way fortune was divided, but also a rebellion against 
the capitalist way of life. Communist saw that a minority lived in better living 
conditions at the expense of the large public. After having owned the means of 
political pressure, Communists made several abuses more dangerous than those 
made by Capitalists. Communists made of Stalin the charismatic leader whose 
every act should be trusted and behavior had to be appreciated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As a conclusion, we can say that George Orwell in <cite>Animal 
Farm</cite> seems to be very pessimistic about how nations are governed by hungry 
leaders. He was writing about a political system which had been full of promise 
and which deteriorated into tyranny. One of his purposes in using the figures of 
the beasts is to portray the actions of men, and to imply that men in their 
political communities were often no better than beasts. Orwell said: "<cite>Animal 
Farm</cite> was the first book in which I tried, with the full consciousness, to 
fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole." It is "tactics" as 
Squealor explained in his speeches. A politician should engage in various 
debates and quarrels. He had to be clever in order to be the winner, so he must 
get rid of his principles. Such was the case of both Napoleon and Stalin who 
owned the political decision lonely. The whole public has no right to complain. 
So, our dictators did not fear being judged one day.</p>
