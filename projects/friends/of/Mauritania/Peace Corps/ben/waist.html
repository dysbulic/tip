    <h1>Waist 2005</h1>
    <h3>Ben Richey</h3>

    <p>This email will only make sense if you're drunk when reading it. If you happen to be sober, (and there isn't any alcohol nearby), scoot your chair back from the screen far enough that the words become fuzzy and hard to make out. O.K. Drunkards&hellip; Squinters&hellip; here are my thoughts on WAIST.</p>
    
    <p>I ran into ___ _______ at the spaghetti dinner. He immediately started in on me about how crazy I must be to have returned to the world's foulest shit-hole, (West Africa). I replied that I may indeed be crazy, but not for returning to WAIST. I tried to convince him of that, told him about seeing friends and playing softball. He wasn't buying any of it&hellip; his head just kept shaking, and his mouth just kept asking, &ldquo;Why, Ben&hellip; why? Why?&rdquo; Eventually I walked away to get another beer.</p>

    <p>So it had ended, this WAIST thing. I was scheduled to get on a plain in just over two hours. ____, ____ and I went to a restaurant for dinner before they took me to the airport. On the menu was this thing called the &ldquo;Metre de Tequila&rdquo;. Needless to say, we got three meter's worth. Fuck, I was tanked when I got on the plane. It was the first time I actually ever gave notice to those little white paper bags in the backseat pockets.</p>

    <p>I've always been proud of my ability to negatively influence other people. At the marine party I instigated ____'s jumping off of the roof into the pool. Like naked dominoes, a number of other people then jumped from the roof into the pool. I was the reason this happened. I begged and pleaded for ____ to do it. But I never did it myself&hellip; I had a softball game to play the next morning. I couldn't show up with a broken leg.</p>


    <p>My host-stay family had a great balcony. It hung right out over The Iguana. ____ and the girl he was trying to hook-up with turned the corner one block up. Those concentric green circles of radars showed up&hellip; ____ and I ran into the kitchen and grabbed the bottle of peanuts. Smooth and sexy, they slid underneath us. They kissed on the sidewalk&hellip; they leaned up against a parked car. ____ and I clenched our lips together to stop our laughter. We filled our hands with fistfuls of peanuts. ____ slid his tongue into her mouth&hellip; his hands touched her belly, and slid around to the back. And then, BOOM! Hail-storm. Vietnam. The peanuts came and conquered, and the two lovers cowered on the curb.</p>
    
    <p>There was a runner on third. The ground ball came our way. I fielded it. Here's the deal&hellip; in this stupid weak-ass softball a rule exists that says once a runner passes the line, (maybe 15 feet from home plate), he/she cannot turn back, and the out at home is a force. Sooooooo, I waited until the bastard passed the line, and then threw it home hard to ____ on the plate. The bastard running down the line plowed her over, knocked her cold. Every guy on our team came running towards home plate. Testosterone knocked the ump into the fence. Ten guys stood screaming around him. ____ screamed, &ldquo;You're hung like a fucking caterpillar&hellip; you fucking asshole.&rdquo; He got ejected from the game. I screamed, &ldquo;Are you kidding me? She was on the fucking plate!&rdquo; ____, the captain, calmed the storm, Ӆ&hellip;.. &hellip;. Ņ. &hellip; Ņ.,&rdquo; he said. But back behind us, the storm was already calmed. ____ was the only guy actually paying attention to ____. He picked her up and wiped the dust off her pants. (That's probably why they're a couple.)</p>

    <h3>Fun WAIST Fact!</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>PC Mauritania's all-time team record in games where ____ did not pitch&hellip; 1 win, 44 losses?</li>
      <li>PC Mauritania's all-time team record in games where ____ did pitch&hellip; 15 wins, 1 loss.</li>
      <li>Hmmm.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I decided to go to bed early. The party had moved from the bonfire to The Viking to the Iguana. I was bored and tired. As I was saying my goodbyes to the drunken dancers, I was asked by the Swedes if I wanted to go &ldquo;smoke&rdquo;. Needless to say, I was still awake four hours later, yelling off of my host-stay families' balcony at the people passing below. At five a.m. ____, ____, and ____ came home. ____ screamed, &ldquo;Ben, listen, Dude&hellip; listen&hellip; listen&hellip; listen to ____'s crazy fucking story.</p>

    <h3>____'s story (condensed version):</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>So I was dancing with this really hot girl. She might've been a (<i>fingers make quotation mark signs</i>) &ldquo;prostitute&rdquo;. It's hard to really say&hellip; And she was so fucking hot&hellip; grinding all over me. Eventually, like, we go outside&hellip; and end up behind this big truck. And, you know, one thing leads to another. She's got her hands all down my pants. And then, like, I look over on the tire and see all the shit that I'd had in my pockets sitting there. I probably normally would've been pretty mad&hellip; she was trying to steal all my shit. But I actually didn't really care at the time. So she's there in front of me, looking at me, and then here comes the bouncer dude from the club. And he just goes (<i>big swooshing swing of the arm</i>) ka-pow! Knocks that bitch about ten feet. He goes after her to hit her again, but I was like&hellip; trying to stop him and shit. So, anyway, she runs off around the truck, and this bouncer dude takes me back inside and buys me a beer.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Monday. The &ldquo;competitive&rdquo; league championship. The high-school team vs. some other stupid team. Here we come. Me, ____, ____ and ____. A parent's worst nightmare. They were all looking at us with that horrible mix of fear and loathing. I felt like a cat in a room full of dogs. WATCH OUT, dogs, he, he, he&hellip; we crouched beside the corner of the concession stand and waited for our game&hellip; we're tigers.</p>

    <p>____ found a nasty old ram's horn in a pile of trash. She thought it would be ideal for a good luck charm. I thought it would be ideal for walking around like I had a huge, swirling penis, and (ram)ing into people. (Bone)ing people, to continue with the puns. ____ saw me with the horn&hellip; drool rolled down her chin. She came sprinting over. Maybe it reminded her of ____'s notorious horn? We had everyone take pictures of our dirty, dirty deed. I felt like Satan must feel while he's boning ____. (Note to self: remove that picture from apartment before mom visits.)</p>

    <p>My host-stay mom handed me her CD case in the elevator. &ldquo;Ben, pick us something for the ride.&rdquo; We were on our way to the casino&hellip; me, ____, ____, and the host-folks. Sleeve after sleeve of assorted Dave Matthews/John Mayer crap&hellip; crap, crap, crap. Jesus Christ, crap&hellip; Eureka! &ldquo;You have <cite>Beauty and the Beast</cite>?&rdquo; I think my host-stay mom started liking me at that point. I think my host-stay dad started (or continued) doing the opposite. So there we were&hellip; ____, ____ and I squished into the backseat, passing a rapidly emptying bottle of Black between the three of us, belting out lines of &ldquo;Be my Guest&rdquo; between gulps. &ldquo;Be my guest, be my guest, stake my servish to the testŔ My host-stay mom kept giggling and turning up the volume. Her husband kept shuddering and turning it down. &ldquo;See my loafers, made of gophersŔ (and if even one of you gets that it was well worth the rest of you having to read it.) Certainly it had to be one of the few times in human history that three people have sung &ldquo;Be my Guest&rdquo; while pounding Senegalese whiskey. I like to push the limits.</p>

    <p>The third-base coach of the Baobab Bashers had his hands on his hips. &ldquo;What's the deal,&rdquo; he asked me, &ldquo;isn't there some kind of limit to how big the players on a team can be?&rdquo; I looked out at the guys on our team. Most of them were about 6 foot 10. I said jokingly, &ldquo;It's all the rice we eat.&rdquo; He nodded intellectually. &ldquo;Is it fortified or something?&rdquo; Really, people are such idiots.</p>

    <p>There were five people in the backseat of the taxi. That's too many. That should've sucked. But ____ was there beside me, and we were kissing&hellip; down beneath everyone else. Only in Peace Corps could two people do that and have it be considered expected.</p>

    <p>Most of you probably know him, (if you don't, you should.) There's a Senegal Volunteer named Randy. (&ldquo;I've heard that name in films.&rdquo;) He is crippled and weighs maybe 100 pounds. At the bonfire I wrestled him. I don't know what the deal was&hellip; I was off my game or something&hellip; but he was kicking my ass. He had me pinned down and useless. Fuck the little bastard. Anyway, in an almost dictionarical&hellip; (I just made that word up,) display of &ldquo;good form&rdquo;, I went up to him a few hours later, at a moment when he was trying to talk to a girl, and tossed his scrawny little ass half way across the softball field.</p>

    <p>So, if you're reading this, ___ _______, here's my answer. I couldn't think of it then. I guess I had to come back to America again to really figure it out&hellip; America's great. The streets aren't covered with trash, (and it's not because hordes of goats ate it all.) There's a single street less than a mile from my apartment that has a Taco Bell, McDonald's, KFC, Arby's, Wendy's and Papa John's. At the grocery store there are free samples of miniature pizza rolls and an entire isle full of beer. In America, when I get into a car I have my own seat&hellip; and the roads I drive on have their own rules. Nobody throws rocks at me here, or points and laughs as I walk on past. But despite all that, (and here's my eventual point,) there's no real hilarity in America. Life here has its feet in cement blocks. I could give a million examples, but ____'s story about the bouncer and the prostitute pretty much sums it up. If that same story happened in America it would be tragic and depressing&hellip; In West Africa, it's one of the funniest stories I've heard. If I had to answer you in one sentence it would be this&hellip; I came back to WAIST because in America the addition of a prostitute never makes a story more fun.</p>
