    <h1>Nouakchott is Fun!</h1>
    <h3>Ben Richey</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>Following the positive response to my write-up about the zoo,
    (and only among a group of really jaded people could a write-up
    like that get a positive response,) I think I'll do a write-up
    of a few other Nouakchott attractions. One might think a
    Nouakchott volunteer would be more suited to do such a
    write-up, but being that I spend more time in Nouakchott than
    most Nouakchott volunteers, I don't feel out of place.</p>

    <h4>The pool hall:</h4>

    <p>A great place to start an evening. A strange Russian woman runs
    the place. She might be mistress to the hot African girls that
    work the place, or maybe just their "motherly figure?" either way,
    she certainly makes one wonder, "How do I work it so I'm running a
    pool hall/brothel in Nouakchott by the time I'm fifty-two?" I'll
    have to ask her. Anyway, make sure you get the upstairs room. The
    downstairs room is a little cramped, evidenced by the fact that
    all the windows have cue-stick-sized holes closed-up by electrical
    tape. The upstairs room is much more spacious, complete with an
    air-conditioning system that can only be figured out if you read
    Chinese, a CD player that plays only Beyonce; and a steady supply
    of shrimp chips brought at regular intervals by a girl that may or
    may not be a prostitute (emphasis on the may). The shrimp chips
    are good, and might make you want to eat other cardboard-like
    items, such as the cylinder that held toilet-paper in the nearby
    bathroom!</p>

    <p>(Well, at least that's how it was for me.) But onward, the
    actual game of pool you'll find unusually difficult. This might be
    due to the fact that the pockets are "smaller than regulation," or
    the fact that the box of wine you brought with you is already
    empty. I've found that the easiest way to win at pool with fellow
    Peace Corps Volunteers is to wait until they scratch trying to
    make the eight ball. It's nice because it doesn't actually require
    me making any shots.</p>

    <h4>On to the L'Ksar:</h4>

    <p>The one legitimate bar in Nouakchott. When I say legitimate I
    mean a place filled with bald white guys buying twenty-one year
    old Pulaar women pizzas and martinis. It's nice. At the L'Ksar we
    have a special "Peace Corps Rate;" one-thousand for a mixed drink,
    compared to the normal fifteen-hundred. The fact that a place can
    reduce the price of something by one-third and still see it as a
    positive business venture says something about the frequency, (or
    desperation,) with which volunteers there drink. It's great to go
    in there, have the woman behind the bar say, "Mille cinq-cent,"
    and be able to say, "Oh, je suis Corps de la Paix, c'est toujours
    mille," have her smile and nod, pay, and then really feel like a
    ridiculous alcoholic. The L'Ksar is a nice place to sit and talk
    with friends and look at the waitress/prostitutes who you can then
    envision while masturbating later on. Also, the gin and tonics are
    double-shots, you get peanuts and olives, and olives in general
    are really good.</p>

    <h4>And then we stumble to the V.I.P.:</h4>

    <p>Which stands for "Vibe is People." I don't even need to write
    anything funny about that. This is a great place. It's the
    "coolest" club in the entire country, and you'll be the "coolest"
    person in there. Hurray! Don't expect to be able to talk to anyone
    at the V.I.P., the music is far too loud for that, (and the
    listeners far too drunk). You might see an attractive face and
    yell into the adjacent ear, "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?" And they'll
    answer, "YEAH, I'VE SEEN THEM IN CONCERT!" And you'll say, "WHERE
    ARE YOU FROM?" And they'll say, "NO, IT WAS ONLY TWO-HUNDRED
    OUGUIYA!" And so on, but no matter; just go dance. The music is a
    nice combination of songs like the theme from "Ghost Busters" and
    my personal favorite, "Habibi, Habibi, Ya Habibi." In general, I
    vomit and have to go home before the V.I.P. really gets going,
    that's a shame, because supposedly it gets really "cool" at some
    point around Four A.M. (or around twelve drinks, whichever clock
    you happen to go by).</p>

    <p>Yeah, you don't remember? We went to Ali Baba last night, and I
    got the chwarma plate. It's amazing that it's always the greatest
    thing I've ever eaten. There will be a few can-kids there, and a
    big, fat, golden-lab looking dog. It says something about human
    nature that the begging children are drawn and emaciated, while
    the begging dog looks something like an engorged tick. But I
    shouldn't talk, I fed the dog. Chances are it will follow you
    home, no matter how far that might be. It might be the chwarma you
    just fed it; it might be the smell of fun still wafting behind you
    from the preceding activities. It might be a little bit of both.
    It might just be lonely. Anyway, I named it Justin. It's a good
    name for a dog.</p>
