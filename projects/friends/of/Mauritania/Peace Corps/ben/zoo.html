    <h1>Zoo</h1>
    <h3>Ben Richey</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>If anyone is interested in an economical and enjoyable outing
    in Nouakchott, try visiting the Nouakchott Zoo. It has wisely been
    placed fairly far away from the city center, so a taxi-ride will
    be necessary. As most taxi drivers will have no idea what you're
    talking about if you ask for the zoo, try saying, "Carrefour
    Madrid", getting out and walking south, and then asking all the
    kids that you see, "Mneyn bleyda bil yassir min haywanaat?"</p>

    <p>Eventually you will be directed to a metal grating in a wall
    with a man behind it that may or may not be asleep. If he is
    asleep, congratulations, you get in for free. If he is awake, you
    will have to pay the one-hundred ouguiya entrance fee, but will
    get a nice memento ticket-stub that you can carry in your billfold
    for three or four days afterward. The actually door to the zoo is
    around a corner and just in front of a family tent that may or may
    not be associated with the zoo, (there will be an old toothless
    woman cackling and pointing into the open entranceway, she may
    or may not be an official usher. She might just be crazy.)</p>

    <p>The first thing that strikes you are the wonderful smells
    associated with caging large animals. The flies that will have
    formed a black mask across the nearby lion's face will come and
    greet you, trying to make a similar mask upon your face. Don't
    mind thenn just wave them away. They will quickly enough
    understand and return to the more-festering face of the lion. The
    lioness may or may not be dead when you get there, if so, you'll
    probably enjoy the male twice as much. Try to make him roar by
    poking at him with one of the sticks lying nearby. It really is an
    impressive sound.</p>

    <p>In fine Nouakchott fashion, Nature's greatest enemies have been
    placed directly next to each other; beside the lions are the
    hyenas. Kind of like the miniature poodles of America, these
    mini-hyenas are less of the bone-crunching variety and more of the
    lying apathetically in the corner type. But they do have sweet,
    puppy-dog eyes.</p>

    <p>If you can manage to tear yourself away from the hyenas, there
    are two nearby cages with monkeys and baboons. A woman sits near
    the cages selling bananas and cookies to feed the monkeys and
    baboons, but cigarettes also work. The baboons will begin to eat
    the cigarette, decide not to, and then attempt to stick it in a
    neighboring baboon's anus. Don't make the mistake of sitting too
    close to the bars while taunting the baby baboon. (Otherwise you
    might leave having your tee-shirt sleeve ripped open, or the tip
    of your finger left bleeding. The nearby woman's chant of "huwa
    hatiir, huwa hatiir" should be believed.)</p>

    <p>After the primates, go see the crocodile, it may or may not be
    real. Either way, it is fun to throw pebbles at. Then there is a
    bird that may or may not be a stork, three turkeys, and a duck.
    The duck is especially exciting. You can sit on the concrete ledge
    outside the cage and watch his antics for hours on end. If you
    continue around the loop that the succession of cages makes,
    you'll next pass a wall with paintings of giraffes and leopards on
    it. In absence of the real animals, the paintings are quite
    satisfactory. The leopard especially is in a strikingly realistic
    pose of attack, and the black dots are painted with amazing skill.
    You might even be inspired to go back to your home and paint a
    leopard of your own.</p>

    <p>After the painted animals, there are two empty cages, (one of
    them has a vulture in it, but it may be there of its own accord.)
    Then again the lions. You can make a second trip around the cages
    if you are in that kind of mood, if not you should leave by the
    exit you came in through. If you are really lucky, there might be
    a man out in the parking lot with an air-rifle who will bet you
    twenty ouguiya that you can't shoot the Fanta can sitting ten feet
    away in the sand. If you are a good shot, it is an easy way to win
    back the one-hundred you had to pay to enter the zoo. When you get
    home, be sure to wash off any blood that may or may not be yours.
    And then tell all your friends about how you went to the zoo.</p>
