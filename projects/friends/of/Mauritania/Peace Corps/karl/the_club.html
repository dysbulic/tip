    <p>My name is Karl Adam and I am not only the founder of the club I am also the most "regular" member.</p>
    <p>The first step is to admit you have a problem: "Drink yur damn salts"</p>
    <p>"This is my anus and it is my friend."</p>
    <p>"Who controls the doo-doo? You do. You do."</p>
    <p>Now let us bow our heads and jim our chubbies:</p>
    <p>Dear Jim, your circular bowl of rice has nourished our emaciated bodies. Though even I have lost 15 pounds thus far, please bless me with your chubby so that I too can once agan be swell.</p>
    <p>I need a sign! Someone who has been taken by the devil-milk... Someone who has fallen and seen the turd at the bottom of the toilet... Someone wracked by the dark storms of turbulent bowels... Come forward and be healed by the power of the buttpot!</p>
