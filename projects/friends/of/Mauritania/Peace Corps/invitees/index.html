    <h1>Info for Invitees to Mauritania</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Salutations if you are a new invitee to the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov">Peace Corps</a> in <a href="http://www.mauritania.mr">Mauritania</a>. This page is here to provide you with a bit of introduction and information you might find useful in your preparations.</p>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Listserv</h2>
      <p>There are two forums for invitees: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/riminvites">a group begun in 2005</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/riminvitees/">another group</a> formed while the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/riminvites">intial group</a> was overrun by porm spammers. You'll likely be able to find any answers you're looking for in one of those places.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Webpage</h2>
      <p>A <a href="http://mr.pcvs.org/">webpage</a> is slowly taking form for the volunteers from Mauritania. One of the most interesting things to people soon to be joining us are the <a href="http://mr.pcvs.org/links.html">links</a> which include several sets of pictures and also <a href="http://www.peacecorpsjournals.com">journals</a>. There is also a link to the <a href="http://mr.pcvs.org/site/">original webpage</a> that is in the process of being revised, but which has an abundance of information.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Volunteer Info</h2>
      <p>We have a <a href="http://mr.pcvs.org/roster/">roster</a> of current volunteers that, if you can access it, will be loaded into <a href="http://mr.pcvs.org/volunteers_map/">the map</a>. It is password protected and if you would like to get a password, you have to give me <a href="info.html">some info</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Stretching</h2>
      <p>You'll spend a good part of your first few months here stretching your legs. (Literally, Mauritanian toilet = hole in the ground.) Since at times you may be doing so hurredly you may like to start getting ready with some yoga. The <a href="http://odin.himinbi.org/moon_salutation/">moon salutation</a> is a good one to get the hamstrings and quadriceps.</p>
