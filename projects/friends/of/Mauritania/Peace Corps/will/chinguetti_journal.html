    <p>Ok, I am home once again. I have been completely removed from
    Tech's server, so many things are broken and you ought to consider
    me still incommunicado for another few days still. I am not even
    sure that this will go out...</p>

    <p>The trip went really well though. I really enjoyed the things I
    got to see and the two volunteers from Senegal that Marc and I
    were traveling with turned out to be excellent traveling
    companions.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately the trip was not really good for the exhaustion
    that was already settling in before I left. I am pretty much
    completely wiped out and the little bit of energy I've got is
    going to trying to get caught up and getting back online.</p>
    
    <p>So, I will not be particularly gregarious for a bit, but I do
    have a couple factual bits that are interesting. This first one is
    just our itenerary...</p>

      <p>The girls came in from Senegal and spent some time visiting
      places of interest in Nouakchott including the markets to buy
      silverwork and mulafas, and the hookah bar to smoke a little
      flavored tobacco.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Our first night out was in a little oasis about 30km outside of
      Atar. It is very likely the most beautiful place in this country.
      Nestled in the mouth of a canyon with dark orange sand for a
      carpet and huge palm trees for a ceiling there is a little brook
      running through that is gathered in one place in a little swimming
      hole where we took a dip. We arrived in time to climb up to the
      top of the canyon and watch the sun set over the valley from the
      top of a 150 meter bluff. Like sitting in a postcard...</p>
      <p>Our camping was 1.5kum for the night, 1.5kum for dinner of
      couscous with chicken, and 600um for breakfast of bread and
      jam.</p>
      <p>We bought out the car and paid to go straight to Tergit. The
      regular price would be 3kum to Atar in a car with 6 people and
      then 1kum back to Tergit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">

      </div>
      <p>We spent the night with the volunteers in Atar. It was Easter
      and I was ashamed when I got my third call from the States from
      Sharon and had to admit that I'd left my much coveted Easter egg
      decorating supplies behind because I didn't think I would be able
      to do them. We did do some very fine deviled eggs though with
      garlic and dill picked carrots done by the Atar volunteers. We
      also did dates and creme which is a traditional dish and very
      tasty.</p>
      <p>Room was free. We did 14 eggs which were 700um. The mustard,
      mayonnaise and creme were each 300um. For dinner we went to a
      Malian place and had maffe for 200um. The car to Atar would
      supposedly have been 1kum if we caught it at 6am.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
      <div class="head">
        <span class="dayid">Day Three:</span>
        <span class="startcity">Atar</span>
        <span class="endcity">Chinguetti</span>
        <span class="time">2.5hr</span>
        <span class="price">1.3kum</span>
      </div>
      <p>We headed to the ancient city of Chinguetti for our third day.
      Chinguetti is the seventh holiest city in Islam by virtue of being
      the seventh oldest. It was once a major stop on the trade routes
      as well as being a major center of learning with a university and
      several Islamic libraries. We traveled sitting on top of all of
      our luggage in the back of a pickup truck. We were the only ones
      back there though and it wasn't too uncomfortable. Sunscreen is
      very important though. I was wearing my houlie (think turban) with
      my mouth covered but my nose exposed and it got quite well toasted
      while the rest of my face maintained its usual pallid tone.</p>
      <p>This is currently the height of the tourist season. I saw many
      more white faces that I normally see even in Nouakchott.
      Supposedly it tapers off in May. As we we going to Chinguetti we
      passed a big cushy tour bus with "Club Adventure" painted on the
      side. As I shifted my weight and dug my fingers a bit deeper into
      the netting to keep from rolling off the back of the truck I
      smiled under my turban at the thought of looking at Mauritania
      through a window as adventure.</p>
      <p>Dinner in Chinguetti was spaghetti and it was about 500um
      apiece after factoring in some garlic and onions and tomatoes and
      other bits and pieces.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
      <div class="head">
        <span class="dayid">Day Four:</span>
        <span class="startcity">Chinguetti</span>
        <span class="endcity">Lagaula</span>
        <span class="time">3hr</span>
        <span class="price">10kum/4 = 2.5kum</span>
      </div>
      <p>While in Atar we picked up a dune board from a friend of a
      volunteer. We packed up our board and some supplies and took a
      camel trek out to an oasis about 12km south of Chinguetti called
      Lagaula. We headed out at 8 in the morning and arrived a bit
      before noon. It was too hot to go out so we played some cards
      while we waited for the sun to set a bit. The evening was passed
      dune boarding and admiring the spectacular scenery. Boarding was
      fun. The two disadvantages over snow boarding in my opinion are:
      one, climbing a dune is some serious work. We would have done well
      to bring some rope. Two, doing a face plant into sand is something
      akin to doing it into gravel. It both hurts more and is much less
      pleasant to have a mouthful of.</p>
      <p>Our night in Lagaula was, in a word, cold. We were in a little
      grass hut with nothing but a plastic mat between us and the
      ground. I had my houlie pulled over me, but the fabric is really
      thin. The girls shared a blanket, but I don't think anyone was
      really cozy.</p>
      <p>We bought all of the food that we brought out. A bag of
      couscous and two of vermicelli. Also some garlic, onions and
      chicken as well as the obligatory Jumbo&#x2122; beef bullion cubes that
      are present in most everything. We also brought tea, milk and
      bread. Total cost was probably 1kum apiece for foodstuffs. One of
      our guides also made us hubsah, a traditional unleavened
      Mauritanian bread made under the coals of the fire in the
      sand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
      <div class="head">
        <span class="dayid">Day Five:</span>
        <span class="startcity">Lagaula</span>
        <span class="endcity">Chinguetti</span>
        <span class="time">3hr</span>
        <span class="price">already paid</span>
      </div>
      <p>We rented three camels (2kum/camel) with two guides
      (2kum/guide) and going out one camel carried our stuff while the
      other two were ridden. Coming back we were moving too slow
      apparently because our guides doubled us up on the camels. Marc
      and I had the industrious guide who managed to put a good half a
      kilometer between us and the girls by the end of the trip. I'd
      ridden a camel before and this time was much more comfortable, I
      think because it was on deep sand.</p>
      <p>Once we were back in Chinguetti we hid from the sun for most of
      the day and napped til dinner. We did have bissap (hibiscus) jam
      which one of the volunteers made and was very tasty.</p>
      <p>Dinner was at a local auberge and was 1.5kum for couscous and
      meat sauce. We treated our hostesses, or course, which added
      another 1kum.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
      <div class="head">
        <span class="dayid">Day Six:</span>
        <span class="startcity">Chinguetti</span>
        <span class="endcity">Atar</span>
        <span class="time">8hr</span>
        <span class="price">1.4kum</span>
      </div>
      <p>This was an interesting day. After visiting one of the
      libraries (500um) we set out in the morning with the intention of
      going to Oudane. There are no cars for Oudane from Chinguetti even
      though the crossroads for Oudane is only about 20km outside of
      town. Normal operation would be either to rent a car (20kum+) or
      to go all the way back to Atar (2.5hr). We decided instead to
      hitch and catch the car which would likely be coming from Atar to
      Oudane in the evening. We considered the crossroads, but there is
      no shelter there and it is possible that the car wouldn't stop to
      get us. Chinguetti is on a plateau and there is a gendarme (state
      military) stop at the top of the pass. It is there we decided to
      wait since we would have shelter and the cars have to stop for the
      gendarmes.</p>
      <p>Once there we met a friendly Senegalese fellow who manned the
      post. He enjoyed very much having some company and in particular
      the Senegalese volunteer who spoke Wolof. He made us some
      spaghetti with camel meat and after a while we started playing
      cards with him. Though he'd never played our game before he
      proceeded to take a quick lead which entertained him quite a bit.
      I think our company was a bit too addictive because eventually he
      stopped inquiring as to the destination of cars and simply quickly
      waved them through from the door. It was kinda cute, if a bit
      disquieting. Eventually we decided it was getting too late and so
      we decided to just go to Atar. One of the Senegalese girls ran out
      and flagged down a car and we were on our way.</p>
      <p>In retrospect, Oudane would have been a better first destination
      because catching a car at the crossroads going to Chinguetti would
      have been no problem.</p>
      <p>In Atar we did the Malian restaurant again. This time with some
      beans (200um) and a ginger drink (30um.) For breakfast the next
      morning we treated our hostesses to cornflakes (1kum/box) and milk
      (500um/liter.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
      <div class="head">
        <span class="dayid">Day Seven:</span>
        <span class="startcity">Atar</span>
        <span class="endcity">Choum</span>
        <span class="time">3hr</span>
        <span class="price">16kum/4 = 4kum</span>
      </div>
      <p>We headed out around noon to go to Choum. It was a Friday
      though and everything was closed until 3:00 after the prayer. We
      needed to get to Choum by 6:00 to catch the train so this looked
      to be something of a problem. The trip is normally about 1.5kum
      but we ended up buying out a 4x4 for 16kum so that we could leave
      right at 3:00. Our car was the Land Rover that time forgot.
      Apparently from the early '70's Marc theorized it must have served
      a tour in Vietnam to get as badly beaten as it was. It got us
      there on time though.</p>
      <p>What we later learned is that there is apparently a later train
      that leaves around 10pm that we could have taken. The ride was
      over open desert much of the time though, so having space to
      bounce around was nice. We even picked up a soldier from one of
      the police stops who rode on the foldout chair set up in the
      back.</p>
      <p>We got some sandwiches as we waited at the garage for three
      hours. Like most places they were 200um apiece.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
      <div class="head">
        <span class="dayid">Day Seven:</span>
        <span class="startcity">Choum</span>
        <span class="endcity">Nouadhibou</span>
        <span class="time">12hr</span>
        <span class="price">0um</span>
      </div>
      <p>A lesson we learned about the iron train. The front cars are
      ground iron ore which are pretty finely powdered and supposedly
      soft. The middle cars are crushed red rock varying from gravel
      sized to fist sized. The final two or three cars (out or perhaps
      70-100) are passenger cars. When dropped off the driver will
      assume you are getting in the passenger cars and drop you where
      the passenger cars will stop. Once you learn this and take off
      running to get to the softer iron ore you will not have time to
      make it and will end up getting stuck on the crushed rock of you
      don't miss the train entirely.</p>
      <p>Another lesson is that freezing cold experienced while lying on
      crushed rock for 12 hours does not produce the blessed relief of
      numbness. Rather it generally brings agonizing pain interspersed
      with bouts of unconsciousness that could be confused by an outside
      observer with sleep, but which are in fact the body trying to will
      itself to death to escape the pain and the cold.</p>
      <p>Definitely take a many layers of clothing that you do not mind
      having ruined. Definitely wait in town and get on the front of the
      train.</p>
      <p>Riding in the passenger cars has been likened to sardines and
      the two people I know of who paid 1000um to do it were pick
      pocketed. There is supposedly a luxury car for 2.5kum, but I never
      saw it. I'd personally go with more clothes and ride on top.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
      <div class="head">
        <span class="dayid">Day Eight:</span>
        <span class="startcity">Nouadhibou</span>
      </div>
      <p>We hung around Nouadhibou for a day. The girls went to a hamam
      which is sort of like a steam bath where you get rubbed down and
      exfoliated. They highly recommended it after coming off the train
      with iron ground into every pore. There are separate times for men
      and women (since it is done in the nude) and Marc didn't feel like
      going, so I didn't either. Instead we visited the port and saw
      lots of different kinds of fish come rolling in. One of the more
      interesting was a huge cart loaded down with nothing but
      sharks.</p>
      <p>One of the Nouadhibou volunteers fed us very well during the
      day. I ate a good pound of brownies and cookies I think. It was
      very nice. For dinner we went to a Chinese place and had a
      grilled seafood platter (1.5kum.) It came with these very large
      and surprisingly tender pieces of octopus as well as shrimp and
      squid. I practiced my drinking with a beer (500um), but ended up
      giving half of it to Marc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
      <div class="head">
        <span class="dayid">Day Nine:</span>
        <span class="startcity">Nouadhibou</span>
        <span class="endcity">Nouakchott</span>
        <span class="time">1hr</span>
        <span class="price">10kum</span>
      </div>
      <p>In the morning we walked across the peninsula where Nouadhibou
      is situated from the bay side to the Atlantic side. It was about
      5km and took probably an hour to walk. I've never been to the
      Atlantic seaboard with the jagged rocks and crashing waves, but it
      looked like pictures I've seen of that. It had the added
      excitement of this land was disputed in the '70's between the
      Polisario and Mauritania and they laid land mines in some places.
      It wasn't likely would find one, but I've never been in a place
      where just walking around could get me killed before.</p>
      <p>One of the girls wanted to get back home before her birthday,
      so we decided to fly back to Nouakchott. The airline CMTA has a
      special rate for volunteers, so our tickets were 10kum and it took
      an hour for the flight. Going by car would have been at best 8-10
      hours and would have probably cost about 6kum. Not a bad deal
      really.</p>
      <p>We flew over the Banc d'Arguin as we went down and it looked
      really interesting. It is supposedly one of the best bird parks in
      the world because of the rich fishing waters here and has been a
      Unesco World Heritage Site since 1989. Supposedly renting a car
      is about 25kum a day with a driver and I'm seriously thinking
      about giving that place a visit before I leave.</p>
    </div>

    <hr/>
    
    <p>So, all told I think I spent about 35kum and I was not
    economizing at all. $100 isn't bad for a tour that I think costs
    the French tourists in excess of 1000&#x20AC;. I was surprised to
    learn that the Mauritanian visa was about $160. Apparently the
    U.S. just doubled the price of their visa and Mauritania responded
    in kind.</p>
    
    <p>Such was my trip, hopefully my email comes back to life soon
    and I can send this out. Many, many, many heartfelt thanks to
    Elijah for helping to restore my virtual life.</p>
