    <p>Peace Corps... For most of my life the term "Peace Corps"
     conjured to mind images of tanned hippies with long hair and
     dirty clothes handing out bowls of rice to wide-eyed children
     with distended bellies. I knew it still existed, but thought of
     it as something for those youthful idealists committed to saving
     the world. As my extensive undergraduate career was coming to am
     close I discovered it could also be an attractive choice to those
     a little less idealistic but with no real idea of what they want
     to do save that it wasn't another seven years in college or
     jumping right into the rat race. I figured that I needed some
     time to figure out where I was headed and if I could experience
     some of the world and maybe do a little good in the interim, all
     the better. I thereby began the year and a half long process that
     culminated in my walking off a plane in the Islamic Republic of
     Mauritania last June.</p>
    <p>When I first got my invitation my response was "Mauriwhere?" It
     turned out that Mauritania is actually a pretty big place. In
     west Africa on the coast below Morocco, at over a million square
     kilometers it is ten times the size of Tennessee. At the same
     time it is slowly being consumed by the Sahara desert so less
     than three million people live here (about half as many as
     Nashville). The name means "land of the Maures" where the Maures
     were the nomads who lived here long before the Europeans arrived
     and started drawing borders. As well as the Maures there are a
     variety of African tribes represented here as well; particularly
     the Pulaar, Wolof and Soninke.</p>
    <p>At this point I have been a volunteer for about six of the
     twenty-seven months that I will eventually serve. This country is
     hot, dirty, poor and inefficient. Accomplishing anything takes
     monumental effort and Sisyphean patience. At the same time I
     don't believe that I can describe how much I enjoy being
     here.</p>
    <p>The term "developing world" generally has the sense of a place
     being incomplete somehow; unfinished. It also means though that
     this is a country still fledgling and going through processes of
     development that people in the developed world don't get to
     experience. The capital city of Nouakchott was founded when the
     country gained its independence from the French in 1960. It has
     gone from being a random spot in the sand to being home to over a
     million people (40-50% of the population) in less time than my
     dad has been alive. As the Sahara continues its heedless expansion
     toward the sea many people have been forced here from traditional
     jobs like herding and farming. You can walk the streets and see
     the play of how nomadic lifestyles that existed for thousands of
     years are colliding with modern urbanization.</p>
    <p>At this point in my Peace Corps experience I feel like a person
     who had a completed puzzled knocked from their hands only to
     discover as they collect the pieces that the picture has changed.
     It is a bit hard for me to tell you about the picture when I
     haven't quite gotten it put together myself. So at this point
     I'll just give you a few highlights of differences from six
     months ago:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I can now pretend to speak French. (My students wish that I
       could pretend a little better.)</li>
      <li>I can now tell what time it is by the prayer call being
       played at the mosque.</li>
      <li>I no longer need toilet paper, or a toilet for that matter.
       (What are called "Arab toilets" here we called "a hole in the
       ground" back home.)</li>
      <li>I've read Heller, Dostoevsky, Kafka, Faulkner, Gandhi,
       Solzhenitsyn and about a dozen other good authors. (No TV and
       the expressive ability of a three year old in French leaves
       one with much free time.)</li>
      <li>I can greet (and profane) in half a dozen languages.</li>
      <li>I find 75 degrees quite balmy and don't start to really get
       hot till it passes 100.</li>
      <li>I have ridden a camel, seen my dinner killed and been unable
       to buy brown sugar because the one store in the country that
       sells it was closed.</li>
      <li>I've visited a country other than America. (This was my
       first.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In closing I would just like to say to anyone who is looking
     for a good way to pass two years and who isn't too attached to
     Wal-Mart and Taco Bell consider giving the Peace Crops a try. It
     hasn't yet ceased to amaze me.</p>
