    <h1 lang="en">The Story of Koi and the Kola Nuts</h1>
    <h2 lang="en"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=152697">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=152697</a></h2>
    
    <p lang="en">Come. Sit down. I will tell you a story that comes
    from Africa. It is dawn in the west of Africa. And the sun is a
    big orange-red ball, slowly rising over the horizon.</p>

    <p lang="en">Feel the warm breeze that blows. The rains have just
    come and the earth is full of promise.</p>

    <p lang="en">Flowers bloom and banana trees bear fruit and the
    yams and rice grow well in the fields. Smell the beautiful
    fragrances.</p>

    <p lang="en">Look, the animals gather at the river. Far in the
    distance there is a village. The smoke from the cooking fires
    makes a trail in the sky.</p>

    <p lang="en">Listen. You can hear the sound of the drums. The
    drums spread the news that the chief of a village has died.</p>

    <p lang="en">All of the people and all of the animals from miles
    around hear the message of the drums: Chief Sadaka is dead.</p>

    <p lang="en">A palaver - that's a meeting - is called and all the
    elders of the village gather to decide what to do. They decide
    that the wisest man of the village will divide the chief's
    possessions among the chief's sons.</p>

    <p lang="en">So the wise man counts out to each of the sons so
    many goats, so many cows, so many tusks of ivory and so many
    pieces of gold.</p>

    <p lang="en">The wise man finishes. But here comes Koi, the
    chief's youngest son. He's been hunting and no one fetched him
    when the wise man divided his father's possessions.</p>

    <p lang="en">Since this wise man is wisest when it comes to
    avoiding work, he does not bother to redivide the chief's
    possessions.</p>

    <p lang="en">The wise man looks around and he sees a small, sickly
    kola tree. "Ah, Koi," says the wise man. "And for you we have a
    kola tree over there."</p>

    <p lang="en">"What you say man? cries Koi. "My father the chief
    dies and you only give me this kola tree?"</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi is a proud young man. He grows angry, very angry
    and he cannot abide the slight of the wise man. "I will go to a
    land where I am treated like the son of a chief," Koi says.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi picks all the kola nuts from the tree and wraps
    them into a mat. He ties the mat into a kinja, swings the load
    onto his back and leaves the village.</p>

    <p lang="en">I will never return here," Koi tells the people of
    his village. "You do not know how to treat the son of a chief!"
    Koi walks for nine days with the kinja on his back.</p>

    <p lang="en">The kinja is a heavy load, but the jungle makes good
    music for him to walk by. The birds sing and the chimpanzees play
    hide-and-seek amid the elephant grass.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi watches the zebras galloping across the veld. He
    walks gently past a sleeping lion and lioness, careful not to
    awaken them.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi comes to the foot of a mountain. It's a big
    mountain, with a peak hidden by clouds. He climbs the mountain
    with great difficulty, the kinja getting heavier with each
    step.</p>

    <p lang="en">Finally, he arrives at the top. He sees the lush
    valley beneath him. There is a wide, silvery river curling through
    the valley.</p>

    <p lang="en">"This will be a good place," says Koi. Perhaps the
    people there will know how to treat the son of a chief." Koi makes
    his way down the slope. He sees a large snake, but the snake does
    not see Koi. The snake looks left. The snake looks right. And then
    he slithers along. "What are you looking for, Friend Snake?" says
    Koi.</p>

    <p lang="en">"Oh, it's terrible!" says the snake. "My mother is
    ill and she needs kola medicine. I must find some kola nuts to
    make the medicine that will make her well."</p>

    <p lang="en">"Look no further," says Koi. "I have kola nuts you
    may have. Take them. Make the medicine that will make your mother
    well again."</p>

    <p lang="en">"Oh, you've saved, my mother's life," said the snake.
    "Thank you so very much." "It's nothing," says Koi. "Go quickly
    now! Your mother needs the kola medicine." Koi walks down the
    mountain, happy that he can help Friend Snake.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi sees an army of ants marching in an endless
    column as wide as a zebra's stripe. Koi steps aside to let the
    ants pass.</p>

    <p lang="en">And as the column passes, he hears a tiny,
    high-pitched voice. "Do you know where we can find a kola tree?"
    asked the leader of the ants.</p>

    <p lang="en">"We made a most unfortunate mistake. We ate the
    Forest Devil's kola nuts. A whole basket full! And we must replace
    them or else the Forest Devil will trample us with his gigantic
    feet."</p>

    <p lang="en">"How many do you need?" asks Koi. "He says he wants
    as many kola nuts as he has fingers and toes. Let's see, I have
    six feet, and four toes on each foot..."</p>

    <p lang="en">"The Forest Devil is a person," says Koi. "He has ten
    fingers and ten toes. You need twenty kola nuts."</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi takes twenty kola nuts from his kinja and gives
    them to the ants. They put the nuts on their heads and march down
    the mountain to give the Forest Devil his tribute.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi resumes his journey. At the base of the mountain
    he encounters an alligator. The alligator is crying. "What's your
    trouble?" says Koi.</p>

    <p lang="en">"I accidentally ate the Rain Maker's dog," says the
    alligator. "I am doomed."</p>

    <p lang="en">"The Rain Maker says he will strike me dead with a
    lightning bolt, unless I deliver him a kinja full of kola nuts by
    sunrise. And there are no kola nuts on this side of the mountain.
    It will take me two days to find the kola nuts."</p>

    <p lang="en">"Well how do you know there are no kola nuts on this
    side of the mountain?" says Koi. Koi unwraps a corner of his mat
    to show the alligator his kinja full of kola nuts.</p>

    <p lang="en">"Why, you have many kola nuts," says the alligator.
    "Yes, and I will give you the entire kinja full. You need them
    more than I."</p>

    <p lang="en">So Koi fastens the kinja to the alligator's back, and
    the beast hurries to pay his debt to the Rain Maker.</p>

    <p lang="en">That evening Koi reaches a village. The guard asks:
    "Who comes to the village of the Great Chief Fulikolli?" Koi
    stands proudly and answers: "I am Koi, from the land beyond the
    mountain. I am the son of Chief Sadaka."</p>

    <p lang="en">Now Koi is covered with dust and his legs were
    scratched from the rocks on the mountain. He does not look like a
    chief's son.</p>

    <p lang="en">"Son of a chief?" says the guard. "You look more like
    the son of a hyena." As Koi speaks to the guard, many people from
    the village gather to see the visitor.</p>

    <p lang="en">"He's very dusty," says one old woman. "He's no son
    of a chief. He's just an osu, nothing but an outcast." "Let's eat
    him," says a very large and fat woman. "Let's bury him in the
    anthill," says a tall man.</p>

    <p lang="en">"No, let's feed him to the crocodiles," says another
    man. "I say cook him in the pot," replies the very large and fat
    woman.</p>

    <p lang="en">"The villagers like the fat woman's suggestion. They
    seize Koi and take him away to the pot. And they chant:</p>

    <p lang="en">"He's no son of a chief! He's merely a thief! There's
    nothing worse than an osu with a curse! Let's have a great big
    feast - or a little one at least!"</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi's body shakes with fear. "Surely, this village
    does not know how to treat the son of a chief," he says.</p>

    <p lang="en">And a man dressed in a leopard robe emerges from a
    hut. It's the Great Chief Fulikolli. "What do we have here?" asks
    Chief Fulikolli.</p>

    <p lang="en">"I am Koi, the son of Chief Sadaka from over the
    mountain," says Koi. "I ask if I may be a guest of your village,
    and your people take me to the pot to cook me."</p>

    <p lang="en">The very large and very fat woman shouts: "He's no
    son of a chief. He's an osu. Let's cook him!"</p>

    <p lang="en">The villagers agree. They chant: "He's no son of a
    chief! He's merely a thief! There's nothing worse than an osu with
    a curse! Let's have a great big feast - or at least a little
    one!"</p>

    <p lang="en">"Wait!" says Chief Fulikolli. "We shall test him
    first to see if he is truly the son of a chief." Koi breathes a
    sigh of relief.</p>

    <p lang="en">Chief Fulikolli speaks: "If the boy chops down that
    palm tree so that it falls toward the forest - instead of toward
    the village - we will let him go. If the palm falls toward the
    village...we cook him!"</p>

    <p lang="en">The chief's people laugh. The palm leans so sharply
    toward the village it looks as though the slightest wind will
    topple it. Koi shudders and sweats. This test is impossible. He
    must think.</p>

    <p lang="en">"Please, Chief Fulikolli, send your people away and
    let me cut the tree down after dark." "Yes," says Chief Fulikolli.
    "It is agreed. You have until morning to fell the tree."</p>

    <p lang="en">The chief gives Koi an ax, and the villagers go to
    their huts dreaming of tomorrow's feast.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi sits beneath the palm to await the night. As he
    waits, he weeps. He does not know how he will make the palm fall
    toward the forest. The cooking pot awaits him, he knows.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi hears the rustling of leaves and vines. "Who is
    it? Speak!" "It's me, Friend Snake," says a voice in the
    night.</p>

    <p lang="en">"I'm tracking you all day. I wish to thank you again
    for the kola nuts you gave to me. My mother is well and she sends
    you her thanks."</p>

    <p lang="en">"That's kind of your mother," says Koi. "But my
    fortune has changed since last we met." "Is that why you weep?
    Tell me." "I must chop down this palm tree so that it falls
    toward the forest or else I shall be cooked."</p>

    <p lang="en">"But look at how it leans. The people of this village
    must drink too much palm wine!" "Exactly," says Koi "It's a
    trick." "Imagine that," says Friend Snake. "Well we must play a
    trick on them. I will get my six uncles, the pythons."</p>

    <p lang="en">The Pythons are Africa's biggest and mightiest
    snakes. At moonrise Friend Snake returns with his six uncles, the
    pythons.</p>

    <p lang="en">The great snakes wrap their tails around the leaning
    palm tree and wrap their necks around the nearby bombax tree.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi chops the palm with all his strength. And when
    the last fiber of the palm is cut, the six uncles pull the tree
    over so that it falls toward the forest.</p>

    <p lang="en">Chief Fulikolli wakes up the next morning and his
    people follow him to see whether Koi has passed the test. Koi sits
    on the felled tree, drinking the milk of a coconut. The tree is in
    the forest.</p>

    <p lang="en">"Look!" says Chief Fulikolli. "The boy shall go
    free!" "It's magic," says a villager." "The boy used ju-ju to push
    the tree into the forest."</p>

    <p lang="en">"Cook him in the pot," says the very large fat woman.
    "Let's cook him tonight!"</p>

    <p lang="en">The people chant: "He's no son of a chief! He is
    merely a thief! There's nothing worse than an osu with a curse!
    Let's have a big feast -or a little one at least!</p>

    <p lang="en">"Quiet!" says Chief Fulikolli. "We will test the boy
    once more. We will scatter ten baskets of rice in my fields, if he
    picks up every grain in the dark of the night he is truly the son
    of a chief, and I will free him. If he fails, we cook him tomorrow
    night."</p>

    <p lang="en">When darkness comes Koi goes out to the field with a
    basket. On his hands and knees he feels the ground for grains of
    rice. He tries and tries but he can see nothing. It's an
    impossible task.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi feels hopeless. "This is no way to treat the son
    of a chief." A tear rolls down his cheek and falls onto the head
    of an ant.</p>

    <p lang="en">A reedy, high-pitched voice exclaims: "RAIN! ...RAIN!
    ...RAIN! Everybody take cover, the floods have come!</p>

    <p lang="en">"Wait! wait!" says the ant. "Rain isn't salty. Look,
    it is a boy who is crying. Aren't you the boy who gave us the kola
    nuts two days ago?"</p>

    <p lang="en">"Yes," said Koi. "But now I am in danger. I must
    gather the ten baskets of rice spread in the field by morning, or
    else I shall be cooked."</p>

    <p lang="en">"Do not worry, my friend. You bring the baskets and
    my people will pick up the rice." Soon the fields crawl with
    millions of ants, and each ant carries a grain of rice.</p>

    <p lang="en">The next morning the ten baskets of rice sit before
    the hut of Chief Fulikolli. Koi sits in front of the baskets,
    eating a wild plum. "You perform well," says the chief. "Now you
    go free."</p>

    <p lang="en">The people of the village surround Koi and Chief
    Fulikolli. "He's a sorcerer," says one villager. "He's the devil,"
    says another. "Whatever he is, he cheats us of a feast," says
    still another.</p>

    <p lang="en">"Let Chief Fulikolli free him," whispers the very
    large and very fat woman to the very short man. We will catch him
    outside the village and cook him ourselves."</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi hears what the fat woman says. He speaks to the
    chief: "I'm afraid to go. Your people want to eat me and they will
    overtake me when I'm outside the village."</p>

    <p lang="en">Chief Fulikolli stands before his people and
    announces in a big voice: "There will be no feast...yet. I will
    test the boy one more time. I shall throw my medicine ring into
    the deepest part of the river. And if he brings it back to me,
    will you honor him as the son of a chief?"</p>

    <p lang="en">The people of this village are pleased. In one voice
    they chant: "We promise, Chief Fulikolli! We promise, we promise!"
    The chief raises his arms over his head. There is silence. "It is
    decided," says the chief.</p>

    <p lang="en">Chief Fulikolli and his people go to the river. The
    chief throws his medicine ring into the deepest part. Then all go
    back to the village, leaving Koi alone on the bank.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi looks at the deep dark waters of that river.
    "Even Chief Fulikolli tries to destroy me," says Koi. "I do not
    even swim." Koi wades into the river. He sees a long, gray nose of
    an alligator gliding toward him. Koi is frightened.</p>

    <p lang="en">The alligator grins when he sees Koi. "Don't you
    remember me?. You gave me your kinja full of kola nuts and saved
    me from the wrath of the Rain Maker.</p>

    <p lang="en">"Oh, I am glad that you still live," said Koi. "As
    for me, this is the night before I die. I must bring up the
    chief's medicine ring from the bottom of the river by dawn or I
    shall be cooked."</p>

    <p lang="en">"You don't say. Perhaps I can help you. I think I
    swim a little better than you."</p>

    <p lang="en">The alligator dives under the water and comes up with
    a small clam shell. He dives again and brings up a fish. The
    alligator dives in and out and in and out of that water all
    night.</p>

    <p lang="en">When the sun begins to rise the alligator comes up
    for the last time. He has nothing. It's too late. Chief Fulikolli
    and his people will arrive in moments.</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi is certain he will be cooked. "I thank you,
    alligator. You've helped me as though you were my brother. But
    it's no use. I will be cooked."</p>

    <p lang="en">Then the alligator smiles. Looped on one of his
    biggest and sharpest teeth is Chief Fulikolli's medicine ring.
    "That is it!" shouts Koi. "That is it." Koi takes the ring and
    dances with it to the village.</p>

    <p lang="en">When Chief Fulikolli sees that Koi holds the medicine
    ring he smiles. He takes off his leopard skin robe and puts it on
    Koi's shoulders. The chief stands before his people and says:
    "Surely this is the son of a chief!"</p>

    <p lang="en">Koi turns to Chief Fulikolli and says, "I have found
    a village where the people know how to treat the son of a
    chief."</p>

    <p lang="en">Suddenly a smile comes over the face of the very
    large and very fat woman, as she sings: Now we will have a feast!
    Finally, we will have a feast!" And now the story is over.</p>
