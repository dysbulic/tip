    <div><strong>Subject:</strong> help requested for a router selection for Mouknass in Mauritania</div>

    <p>Hi, my name is Will Holcomb and I am a Peace Corps Volunteer
    living in Nouakchott and trying to help Mohammed Mouknass with his
    project to offer VoIP international calling in Mauritania. I am
    not a complete novice (Mohamed contacted me because I teach at the
    Cisco Academy at the University). My experience is primarily with
    ethernets and not so with telecom. I am working at getting up to
    speed with the terminology so that I can recommend a router.</p>

    <p>The basic problem is this: offer VoIP international calling via
    VSAT with an initial capacity for 30 simultaneous calls mixed PSTN
    and GSM.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>The process, as I understand it, is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Customer dials access number</li>
      <li>Channel bank (PSTN or GSM) receives the connection</li>
      <li>Call is transfered via E1 (using CAS) to the router</li>
      <li>Audio is compressed using G.729 or G.723</li>
      <li>Call is encapsulated into IP using H.323</li>
      <li>IP packets sent to VSAT via ethernet (TCP/IP)</li>
      <li>Packets travel the internet to the Voice Service Provider</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Information coming back is just the opposite of that. The one
    bit I am not clear on is the form of the info coming from the
    channel banks. I see that CAS is used, but that is a signaling
    method (data link layer) and not a network layer protocol, right?
    I just don't understand what is traveling along the line between
    the channel bank and the router.</p>

    <p>So, one function of the router is the compression and IP
    encapsulation of the call, right?</p>

    <hr />

    <p>At a user level the process is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Customer calls</li>
      <li>Channel bank receives connection</li>
      <li>Router acting as H.323 gateway requests permission from the
      VSP's gatekeeper to accept the connection</li>
      <li>Connection is established</li>
      <li>Customer converses</li>
      <li>Call terminates</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I'm not really clear on this either. I can see how the
    gatekeeper could reject the call based on lack of bandwidth or if
    a number was unauthorized, but for a prepaid system the user needs
    to connect and step through some prompts before it is known if
    they are authorized or not. Can a gatekeeper instruct a gateway to
    drop a call?</p>
    
    <p>So, another function of the router is to act as a H.323
    gatekeeper.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>Since we are using a satellite the RTT will at least be 600ms.
    This means that the connection will need echo cancellation
    support, right? I saw echo cancellation listed as an option on
    your GSM channel bank, but not on the PSTN channel bank, so that
    means that will have to be done in the router, right?</p>

    <hr />

    <p>The connection to the VSAT could be ethernet, I believe, but I
    am concerned about being locked into a satellite in an environment
    which doesn't have currently, but will soon have fiber connections
    to the outside world. Particularly for an application like this
    where latency affects quality of service dramatically. So, having
    an E1 connection to the satellite or the ability to upgrade the
    router to support an E1 is likely a good decision. It means that
    if E1's become available reliably and cheaply he will be able to
    transition without major cost and reconfiguration.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>The router that Mohamed told me you recommended is the 3640,
    but it has unfortunately been discontinued.</p>

    <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps274/ps278/index.html">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps274/ps278/index.html</a>

    <p>As I am understanding it the router he will need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 E1 connections (for the GSM and PSTN channel banks)</li>
      <li>1 E1 connection for the VSAT</li>
      <li>H.323 gateway and encapsulation support</li>
      <li>G.723 or G729 audio compression support</li>
      <li>echo cancellation support</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So, do you have a recommendation for a router? I am still
    wandering through Cisco's site trying to identify products that
    meet these criteria. It looks like the AS5300 series does. They
    make "network modules" that plug into the routers and these
    
    take one, which would not provide the 3 E1's needed. The 3725 can
    take two, the 3640 (if it existed) three, and the 3660 and 3745
    six.</p>

    <p>As best I can tell you have to have the CallManager software to
    have the G.729 compression support. I cannot find it mentioned
    anywhere in the documentation for the 3725 and the documentation
    on using the 3000 series in VoIP includes it.</p>

    <a href="http://cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps282/products_data_sheet09186a0080182d38.html">http://cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps282/products_data_sheet09186a0080182d38.html</a>

    <p>The 3727 looks like what I would go with, I think. You could do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cisco 3725 Multiservice Access Router</li>
      <li>Cisco 2 port Channelized E1 w/PRI network module (NM-2CE1T1-PRI)</li>
      <li>2 x Cisco 4 port FXO voice interface card (VIC2-4FXO)</li>
      <li>Cisco Call Manager Software</li>
      <li>Orion E1 GSM Channel Bank</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Cisco VIC's would take the place of the channel bank since
    the initial offering was only going to be 10 lines and this would
    provide 8. There is an additional slot available for 4 more. This
    would allow a test of the popularity of PSTN calls without the
    cost of a full channel bank. (The wisdom in this depends on the
    costs of those pieces of equipment which I do not know.)</p>

    <p>Assuming that the VSAT can be connected to via ethernet this
    actually leaves one E1 port unused and a 1 port module could be
    purchased instead. Given that both getting a land line E1 and
    getting a PSTN channel bank will require an additional E1, unless
    the cost difference is extreme between the 1 and 2 port versions
    I'd consider it prudent to go with the 2 port.</p>

    <p>I am also assuming that there is a significant price difference
    between the AS5300 which is more aimed at this market and the
    3725.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, any feedback is appreciated. As I mentioned I am a
    novice.</p>

    <p>Thanks, Will Holcomb</p>
