    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">The sun's gone down beneath the sand</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Where direction spends the night.</span>
      <span class="poem line1">If logic suffers in the sun,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">It evaporates with the moonlight.</span>

      <span class="poem line1">I walk by a dog lying in the pale</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Sand on its side in a shallow</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Pit of sand, motionless.  Perhaps</span>
      <span class="poem line1">It breathes, perhaps it dreams.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">I cast my moon-</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Shadow and move on,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Through the maze of gray</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Powdered earth stretching home.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">Where are the firmer roads</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Of my former place</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Where I once found reference</span>
      <span class="poem line1">In familiar space?</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">The familiar lingers here in the small,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">The superfluous; in flashlights,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">The incongruous; in T.V and</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Internal combustion shrapnel</span>
      <span class="poem line1">That tears through comprehensible simplicity.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">Past, present, future: these are tired words.</span>
      <span class="poem line1">There are ten words for sand</span>
      <span class="poem line1">And one for beauty.  There are</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Ten words for sand, one for beauty</span>
      <span class="poem line1">And I don't know which to use</span>
      <span class="poem line1">For what now bogs me down.</span>
