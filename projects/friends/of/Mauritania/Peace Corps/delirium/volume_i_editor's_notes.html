    <h1>Note from the Editor</h1>
    <hr />
    <p><em>Delirium</em> is a journal of ideas, perceptions, feelings;
    a compilation of what we, as Americans living abroad, see and
    experience and do day-in-day-out as development workers living in
    Mauritania. Our lives here often seem a strange and confusing
    blend of present and past, of who we now are and who we once were.
    A volunteer struggling to integrate into a new society is at once
    a dual reality, a conflict of cultures, a self forced to let go of
    or re-evaluate its once cherished beliefs and convictions about
    what it means to exist. That is to say, what it means to be a
    woman or man or husband or wife or educator or farmer or
    entrepreneur living and working in an unfamiliar world, governed
    by different social norms and not fully understood culturally
    determined ways of being. In short, as development workers, we
    must take on new ways of defining what and who we are in order to
    be effective members of the society we are trying to understand,
    perhaps (some would say) change. This often means we must give
    up�perhaps briefly forget�a large part of the selves we once knew.
    Thus we fall into estrangement, confusion, conflict with
    ourselves. We live a divided life. An integrated volunteer is,
    consciously or unconsciously, at conflict with her/himself,
    floating between two worlds, an apparition in one, a stranger in
    the other. With no outlet, Disillusionment sets in. The Malaise
    comes on. One feels ennui and indifference rise up and overwhelm
    them. The phenomenon of Madness rules the opposite extreme,
    brought on by a feeling of abandonment into a world without sense
    or order. Accompanying anger, frustration, and rage find their
    outlet, sadly enough, through cynicism and despair. Either way,
    life quickly loses meaning and purpose, each day but a listless
    commentary on the last.</p>

    <p><em>Delirium</em> hopes to provide a creative and intellectual
    outlet for the disillusionment many volunteers and Americans
    living abroad may face when confronted by the real life issues
    raised by living in a developing country. Many of these points of
    conflict are rooted in the concept of cultural relativism. How,
    for example, is one supposed to interpret, let alone spend two or
    so years, living in a community where remnants of slavery or
    female genitalia mutilation can still be found in the social
    practices? On a less extreme, but no less worrisome level,
    poverty, malnutrition, starvation, traditional gender and
    religious roles, arranged or multiple marriages, and similar
    social, economic and environmental problems present serious
    challenges for those of us unwilling to question or confront our
    own beliefs and systems of value.</p>

    <p>I also hope that <em>Delirium</em> will be used as an
    opportunity to express some of the beauty and mystery to be found
    in Mauritania, a chance for us to look deeper into the vast
    ambiguity of its landscape, the hidden enigmas and complexities of
    its social character, the rich diversity of its peoples and
    languages. Numerous aspects of life in Mauritania have yet to be
    discovered, appreciated, or adequately explained for the world at
    large. In many ways the substance of our impressions living here
    will, if recorded, give voice to a land that has yet to be heard,
    at least in the Western world.</p>

    <p>As is customary, I would like to thank everyone for their
    submissions, along with Matt C. for his help as sub-editor, Kevin
    S. for his fast-fingered typing, and Tu D. for designing the cover
    page. The next issue of <em>Delirium</em> is set for late March.
    Please send all submissions, responses, requests, inquiries,
    suggestions, etc., to Paul no later than March 1st. Although a
    good deal of content in <em>Delirium</em> is Mauritania specific,
    the editors will not exclude, and highly encourage, submission of
    other literary material, however obliquely related to topics
    pertaining to Mauritania.</p>
