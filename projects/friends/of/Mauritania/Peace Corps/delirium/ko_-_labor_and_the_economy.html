    <h1>Labor and the Economy</h1>
    <h3>Jason Ko</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>The onset of globalization makes trade and competition fiercer
    than ever. Products from all around the world are flooding
    domestic markets. This in turn has placed domestic products on the
    same shelf at the supermarket as international ones. With trade
    barriers rapidly falling, the domestic firms that produce these
    products find themselves more and more exposed to the
    international competition, who often face different, and some
    would say unfair or unjust, conditions of production. This is a
    good thing. Healthy competition breeds innovation and productivity
    weeding out the inept and inefficient. Consumers win with cheaper,
    better products. There has been an unfortunate loser in this
    conflict, the domestic laborer. International competition
    sometimes forces domestic firms to downsize their operations or
    shut down completely. Former employees with stable jobs for the
    past twenty or thirty years now find themselves cursing NAFTA and
    the WTO from their armchair as they watch Days of our Lives. Why
    must domestic firms cut their labor forces? Cannot the government
    intervene to prevent this from happening? After all does not the
    domestic government have a responsibility to protect its citizens'
    interests?</p>

    <p>As learned in Econ 101, an economy is made up of many firms.
    These firms produce products or services that are demanded by the
    public for consumption. As the public is ever changing in
    composition and size, these demands are themselves ever changing.
    In a large economy, short-term changes in demand are often
    negligible as the average demands of the population steady sudden
    fluctuations. However, this is not to say that a consumer's basket
    of goods does not change. Introductions of new technology,
    duration of aesthetic and functional fads, and the general chaos
    that is the consumer; all these factors can and do augment, over
    time, the consumption demands of Joe and Jane Public. A market
    needs to be dynamic, competitive, and flexible to react to these
    changes.</p>

    <p>If a market is to be dynamic and flexible, the firms that
    comprise it need to be dynamic and flexible. If a firm is to be
    dynamic and flexible, it needs to be able to alter its level of
    production and change the product itself. How is this applicable
    to the laborer? A firm needs to be able to hire or fire to change
    productivity as the market demands. A firm needs to be able to
    search out new skills and fresh ideas in laborers to replace the
    outdated and stagnant. Sometimes old dogs really can't learn.
    Keeping on a workforce that produces beyond that which is demanded
    will only serve to flood the market, lowering prices, eliminating
    profit and driving the firm out of the market. Older workers are
    usually not as well versed in new technologies while possessing
    knowledge of experience that many college graduates have only
    studied in theory. A firm, to remain profitable, will select those
    laborers which benefit production the most. How each firm analyzes
    the marginal benefit of each laborer is another question.</p>

    <p>If a market is to be competitive, its dynamics cannot be
    stagnant. In the case of the United States, recognizing the
    transition of the economy from manufacturing to services would be
    a start. Much like the Industrial Revolution spurred the shift
    from agriculture to manufacturing, the accumulation of wealth and
    the availability of large disposable incomes make luxury and
    services the largest GDP generators. If a market is to recognize
    the current trend, the labor within the market needs to recognize
    the trend. But labor is comprised of people who are of the habit
    to be content when sedentary. Thus it falls on the firms to coax
    and aid laborers to recognize market trends. This can happen
    through migration of labor to a different field. In other words,
    when workers of a certain profession are unable to find work, they
    need to look elsewhere.</p>

    <p>These evolutions and definitions are the qualities of a healthy
    economy that responds to the demands of its consumers. Labor needs
    to be mobile in order to successfully cooperate with the natural
    forces of the market, which in turn ensure the convergence of its
    intrinsic energies, that firms produce during competition,
    resulting in a happy consumer. Mobile labor means the acceptance
    of right and justification for firms to hire and fire at will.
    Government intervention in this field will thus inhibit innovation
    and efficiency. As a result of the policies of their governments
    of the big three economies of continental Europe consist of labor
    less mobile than the United States. Not surprisingly they also
    have a higher unemployment rate. When the market is allowed to
    operate, the general public benefits. If the government were to
    follow policies that encouraged the retention of employees that
    the market would reject, the domestic firm becomes stagnant and
    noncompetitive, requiring further government action of the same
    kind in the future.</p>

    <p>Japan's current financial situation can be traced to such
    manipulation. The Japanese government gave and still gives over 5
    trillion Yen in subsidized loans each year to businesses that
    would otherwise be bankrupt. In addition, the government has
    contracted and subsidized an extreme excess of construction
    projects over the past two decades. Such encouragement is welcome
    in times of recession, but unnecessary and detrimental to the
    economy during boom times as were the 80's. Some economists argue
    that these actions can be attributed to the Japanese fear of
    unemployment innate in their culture. Regardless of the reasoning
    behind the actions, the actions have still contributed to
    multitude of bad loans, and other ways of undermining market
    forces, that are largely responsible for the depression overseas.
    Government interference against market forces is destructive. This
    necessarily makes the American government subsidization of steel
    manufacturing and agriculture outdated to say the least.</p>

    <p>Last year, the Bush administration lumped tariffs near 40% on
    imported steel from most countries to prop up the ailing domestic
    industry. Some would argue that this was done to win support from
    such steel states as Pennsylvania. Unions were good when workers
    rights are abused, but this is not the case here. Regardless of
    the politics involved, supporting inefficient industries or those
    that have lost their competitive advantage only delays the
    inevitable collapse of the firms involved and harms the consumer
    by way of higher prices. We can all reminisce of the good old days
    of turn of the century America when we watch football; there is no
    need to prop up a dead dog in the face of international
    competition.</p>

    <p>The farm subsidies were given in exchange for fast track
    authority earlier this year. Fast track is good, but the subsidies
    are now almost double the level they were after the reduction in
    the Clinton era. How is this progress? Furthermore, 75% of the
    subsidies will go to the largest and richest 10% of the farmers.
    US farms need to focus on their relative advantage, such as
    organic production, compared with foreign producers, and this does
    certainly not include wheat and corn, which are the main
    beneficiaries of the subsidies. These government policies
    illustrate the frequent lack of support that world governments and
    leaders give to the promotion of freer labor markets.</p>
  
    <p>Some point out that these subsidizations are keeping thousands
    of people employed who would otherwise not be. It is unfortunate
    that their employment conflicts with what is good for the overall
    economy. Instead of subsidizing inefficient industries, the
    federal government can expand and improve the welfare state.
    Unemployment benefits are certainly valid in this light, but they
    need to be constructed to encourage brief subscriptions.
    Governments of large populations need to be wary of extensive
    welfare systems. Europe's big three continental economies, who
    have significantly larger welfare states than the more market
    oriented ones of the US and Britain, have consistently higher
    unemployment rates, at times 30-40% higher, than their English
    speaking counterparts.</p>
    
    <p>A government can also provide training funds through welfare to
    those laid off during recognized shifts demand trends. The
    government could, for example, direct the subsidization money
    destined for the steel and farming industries to documented
    unfortunates, from the healthy downsizing, in the form tuition at
    technical schools (ITT Tech). In this way the recently unemployed
    gain skills that are more relevant to their society and they can
    reenter the labor market more marketable. Already exist such
    programs such as the Pension Benefit Guarunty Corporation, which
    assumes financial responsibility for the pensions of former
    employees of companies that went under. A government in this
    manner can encourage flexibility and change within a labor market,
    benefiting competition, without leaving its constituents out to
    dry. Certainly it is better for the newly unemployed to retain
    their old job. But this is both inefficient and irresponsible.</p>

    <p>Liberalisation of labor migration should not be limited to a
    domestic level. Globalization, whether we like it or not, is
    rapidly becoming an integral part of the world economy. It is no
    longer odd to see fresh vegetables from South America at your
    corner grocery store, or more Toyotas than Fords on Smalltown's
    Main St, or Chinese fabricated plastic goods in Mauritania, as it
    was thirty years ago. The incorporation of developing economies'
    products into western markets, and vice versa, can be the subject
    of the utmost sensitivity between governments. International labor
    movements have been relevant to politics since before Moses asked
    for an early termination of his labor unions contract. Oh wait
    that was slavery. But it's beside the point, which is that often
    times the place with the work has no workers, thus requiring the
    importation of labor, who can be compensated better as compared to
    their former place or country of employment. Either that or their
    new employer has a really big army.</p>

    <p>International labor migration presents the same benefits of
    domestic mobility. The main benefit is the absolute increase in
    global capital production. Anytime a worker can naturally be paid
    more for his/her travails, anytime an unemployed becomes employed,
    whenever a person learns a new production skill, all this adds to
    capital production and circulation. A laborer that is restricted
    beneath his/her potential productiveness in his/her native country
    can migrate and increase his/her income generation and
    productivity. Service oriented economies of the developed world
    need unskilled labor of the undeveloped world to fill positions
    that are unwanted by the educated and proud domestic population.
    Skilled laborers from abroad bring different ideas which aid
    innovation. They are also more likely to start their own
    businesses. Increased competition for positions benefits the
    product.</p>

    <p>Again though, does not the domestic government have a
    responsibility to its citizens to protect their jobs? Education
    within the domestic society is an advantage that any immigrant
    would long for. The ability to speak fluently the language of
    pertinence is a skill that firms identify universally as a
    positive attribute. Thus the government already gives its citizens
    an inherent advantage over immigrants and need not give any more.
    Although many people legitimately subscribe to the philosophy of
    elitism (including certain intelligent and good looking guys in
    the Trarza) and while there are many places for its useful and
    beneficial application, a competitive market is not one of them.
    Further restriction of natural market forces defeats the purpose
    of having a market. It is argued here that governments have a
    larger responsibility to uphold and support the natural market
    forces that benefit all society, rather than restrict and block
    them, thus creating unnatural forces, to save a few. Therefore
    policies directed at limiting international migration for the
    reasons of domestic labor protection are counterproductive and
    inefficient in an economic sense.</p>

    <p>However, limitation can be desirable, even a necessity, when
    looking at the social picture. Welfare states are ill equipped to
    handle large influxes of participants. Additionally cultural
    integration, or combination, takes time, and thus should be
    regulated to avoid upsetting social malcontents. The government
    can abet this integration by distributing funds to affected areas
    of immigration for intensive English language programs. More taxes
    could be generated by legalizing the millions of illegal
    immigrants, who currently do not pay income taxes yet take
    advantage of the fruits of their implementation. Nor do they
    receive benefits from employers, and thus drive down wages
    unnaturally for other laborers. Ideally workers would be able to
    migrate freely to where the work was, essentially becoming
    completely synergetic with the global market.</p>
    
    <p>Broadening the scope of labor migration to an international
    level brings along with it many problems from language to
    citizenship to education to terrorism. However problems of
    implementation should not discourage action. NAFTA recently
    explored this conjunction of dilemmas, as has the EU. US-Mexico
    relations are largely based on these problems and solutions. Speak
    with any resident of California or Texas, and you would find a
    relevant perspective on international migration. Many solutions
    have been tried and many more are proposed. Germany has proposed
    waiting periods of seven years, regarding domestic welfare, for
    eastern migrants anticipating their country's accession to the EU.
    Australia has a foreign born workforce of almost 25%. A Cape
    Verdian volunteer told me that near 80% of the capital production
    there is generated by remittances from domestic labor abroad. In a
    survey of international labor migration, the November 4th issue of
    The Economist explored these problems better than could done be
    here, those interested should read it.</p>

    <p>The recognition of the relevance and necessity of the
    encouragement of the globalization and liberalization of labor
    markets through government policies is not always apparent in
    today's society. Subsidization of industries may win political
    votes with labor groups and large antiquated corporations, but it
    is not medicine for an economy, quite the contrary, it is merely
    makeup over the cancer. The labor within these industries need to
    be encouraged to change fields not stay in their no longer
    competitive one. This means people need to be fired or laid off.
    It is a sad but necessary action that sustains a healthy and
    competitive market. All the people in an economy cannot be happy
    all the time, a good head of state will serve his/her country by
    leading them, in contrast to being thrust forward by the energy
    behind, and sometimes this necessitates making people unhappy for
    the benefit of the economy. When the economy is happy, the
    participating population benefits.</p>
