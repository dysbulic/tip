    <p class="address">Dear Ms. Clement,</p>

    <p>I am a returned volunteer from Mauritania who served in Rosso
    from 1988-1990. At that time I taught English at the Lycee de
    Rosso. Currently, I teach English and Current Events at a high
    school in Bremerton, Washington. My colleagues and I are doing a
    unit on World News. For Peace Corps Day we gave our students two
    articles to read about Mauritania.</p>

    <p>The first article that the students read was Elinor Burkett's
    <i>God Created Me To Be A Slave,</i> from the October 12, 1997 New
    York Times Sunday Magazine. I am aware that many Peace Corps
    Volunteers and Mauritanian enthusiasts disagree with this article,
    but it was chosen to raise the awareness of the existence of
    slavery in places other than the United States. It also puts
    slavery in a very different context than our own history with it.
    Finally, I think the article paints a realistic picture of life in
    Mauritania and the level of poverty in which Mauritanians
    live.</p>

    <p>The second article we read was Howard French's <i>Dagana
    Journal; Where Proud Moors Rule, Blacks Are Outcasts,</i> also
    from The New York Times, dated January 11, 1996. This article is a
    little more near and dear to my heart because, even though I did
    not see evidence of slavery in Mauritania, I was there during "les
    evenements" in 1989, watching Rosso go from a bustling border town
    to a virtual ghost town. I watched from my rooftop as my students,
    part of the angry mob, pounded on my neighbors' doors, demanding
    "carte d'indentitie!" It was a frightening time living under the
    restrictions of a 24-hour curfew and a Nouakchott consolidation.
    By the time I returned to Rosso in the fall for the start of
    school, many of my friends, neighbors and colleagues were gone. It
    was like starting all over. The purpose of these letters is to
    hopefully get an update from the current volunteers about living
    conditions in Mauritania today. I'd like my students to ask
    volunteers their opinion about these articles, as well as how
    things have changed since the time they were written. Please share
    our letters with some volunteers and encourage them to write back
    to us. We anxiously await your response.</p>

    <p class="address">Dear Peace Corps Volunteer,</p>

    <p>My name is Deneva Broughton-Neiswanger. I live in Bremerton,
    Washington and attend Renaissance High School. Writing to you is
    an assignment for my Current Events class. I'm glad my teacher,
    Sam, gave me this assignment because I'm considering joining the
    Peace Corps after college. Through this letter I can get
    information about what it's like to be a member of the Peace
    Corps.</p>

    <p>In class students were handed out two articles about conditions
    in Mauritania. The first article, <i>Where Proud Moors Rule,
    Blacks Are Outcasts</i>, talks about black Africans being kicked
    off their own land. Some of the people who were exiled found their
    way to refugee camps. Some of the young refugees tried to take
    back their land with guns and violence. The second article, <i>God
    Created Me To Be A Slave</i>, is the story of Fatma, a former
    slave girl. She is now technically free, but in her mind she will
    always think herself a slave. For Fatma and her family being a
    slave is just how it is and there is nothing wrong with that. The
    only reason she ran away was because she was convinced her master
    would kill her. In Mauritania all slaves are technically free, but
    since they don't have enough education to know this or find out
    ways to enforce the law, they just go on being - from the sounds
    of it - completely submissive slaves.</p>

    <p>Are these two articles painting an accurate picture of what is
    happening in Mauritania? How in this day and age could slavery
    still be going on? The people in Mauritania have to realize it's
    wrong. I mean they are the only country in the world who hasn't
    outlawed slavery. In your opinion, is slavery going on in
    Mauritania? From these two articles, it seems like Mauritania is a
    horrible place to be if you are a black African? Would you agree
    or disagree with this statement?</p>

    <p>What is the Peace Corps doing in Mauritania? Are you doing
    anything to help calm down the conflicts between the Moors and the
    black Africans? It sounds like trouble is brewing between these
    two groups of people. For you, what is your daily life like as a
    Peace Corps volunteer? Is your assignment like you expected it to
    be? As someone who has been a part of the Peace Corps would you
    recommend going to Mauritania on an assignment?</p>

    <p>I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. Please do write
    our school back with information on the current situation in
    Mauritania. I do hope the conditions have changed since those
    articles were written about three years ago. We would like to know
    about conditions in Mauritania today, as well as personal stories
    from your experiences. I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you for
    taking the time to read our letters.</p>

    <p class="address">Peace Corps Volunteer,</p>

    <p>I'm just a humble high school student who happens to have a
    teacher named Liz Finin, who was in the Peace Corps years ago. Oh,
    I forgot, my name is James Benton, but that's not important, is
    it?</p>

    <p>The purpose of this letter is to ask you a few things. During
    my assignments I have received an interesting article, though not
    entirely surprising, having to do with slavery and racial tensions
    against blacks in Africa, of all places. It explains situations of
    people in Mauritania being thrown out of their homes and having
    their identities stolen. These tensions are between Arab-descent
    Mauritanians who use poor excuses to clash with the country's
    black minority.</p>

    <p>Anyway, my point is to ask if you've encountered similar
    problems in the Peace Corps. I'm sure that volunteering was a life
    changing experience for all of you. Good show! You honor us by
    reading this letter.</p>

    <p class="address">Dear Peace Corps Volunteer,</p>

    <p>Hello my name is John Hunter. I'm twenty years old and I live
    in Bremerton, Washington and attend Renaissance Alternative High
    School. I'm doing research on the actions in Mauritania and the
    refugee camps.</p>

    <p>In some the research I was doing, I found some articles stating
    facts about seventy thousand Mauritanians in refugee camps because
    of being black. Is this true? I also read about a full-blown
    crisis between Mauritania and Senegal. Did you witness these
    actions and watch the killings or were you also running for your
    life? In the articles, it also mentions Mauritania as being under
    attack by international human rights groups because Mauritania is
    one of the last bastions of slavery still in the world. Is this
    true? Have you seen these human rights groups trying to help?</p>

    <p>I was told of a woman named Fatma Mamadou who doesn't know her
    own age and can't count. Are a high majority of Mauritanians like
    this? When Mrs. Mamadou was asked if she had been raped, she
    stated the following: "of course they would come in the night when
    they needed to breed us. Is that what you mean by rape?" These
    things I've read make me sick to my stomach. If this is true, have
    seen this and do others try to stop it, or do they go along with
    it like it's an everyday thing?</p>

    <p>I looked up Mauritanian living conditions like homes and
    accessories and things. All I found was an article stating that
    Mauritanians lived in little nine by twelve foot rooms cobbled
    together with scraps of wood scavenged from building sites,
    lacking furniture, chairs, beds, or tables. Is this the way you
    have to live while volunteering, or do you get stationed in other
    places?</p>

    <p>I'd like to thank you for the time you've taken to read my
    letter. In times like these, I'd like to thank you for standing up
    and volunteering in places like this. I'd also like to thank you
    for being a role model for me; I'd like to take on something like
    this for our world but it takes a lot of guts, and you obviously
    have those. Good luck and thank you again.</p>

    <p class="address">Dear Liz and students of Renaissance High
    School,</p>
    
    <p>My name is Tony Grossman and I am a PCV in Maderdra,
    Mauritania, located in the region of Trarza. I have been here for
    twenty-two months and can tell you that "slavery," in all its
    blurry forms, is something I think often about. I can also say
    that it is one those things never really understood by a
    foreigner, even after living here for two or more years. I will
    give you some of my opinions related to what I see and hear in my
    village, a community made up of white and black Moors.</p>

    <p>Slavery as we know it does not exist in the Islamic Republic of
    Mauritania. There are no chains, no whips, no auctions - though
    there most probably were before the 1967 emancipation act. Through
    my talks with Mauritanians I have come to understand that as
    Arab/Berber tribes migrated south through the Western Sahara, they
    begin to take up slaves. Contrary to much popular belief, the
    original black slaves were not always children stolen from
    defenseless Pulaar and Soninke tribes. A large percentage of the
    original slaves, it seems, were either sold or traded to the
    migrating Moors. It should also be noted that many of these black
    Africans were already slaves in their own respective tribes. Yes,
    black Africans also had slaves. Over the decades, many of these
    slaves acquired the characteristics of their owners and earned
    their freedom. They are known as Black Moors today.</p>

    <p>The current status of slavery in Maderdra is best described as
    a "worker caste." Nearly all manual labor done in Maderdra is done
    by Black Moors. Do they get paid for this work? Sometimes. Is it
    enough? It is enough to live on, but rarely enough to take a day
    off. I would say ninety percent of black families in Maderdra
    struggle everyday to put food on the table and clothe their
    children. Quite the opposite is the case with the typical White
    Moor family. Many eat four healthy meals a day and spend much of
    the day resting, while being served by the so-called "working
    caste." Moreover, it is extremely rare to see a White Moor family
    struggling to survive, and even rarer to see a dark-skinned Moor
    in a position of political power. The economic disparity between
    White and Black Moors is very clear-cut, while what is considered
    slavery much more vague.</p>

    <p>To explain to you how blurry the lines between slavery and
    freedom are, I will describe for you my current living situation
    with my host-family in Maderdra. I spend approximately four hours
    a day with them, taking lunch and dinner. We usually have meat and
    rice with very few carrots and sometimes Moringa leaves (courtesy
    of yours truly - the introduction of this beneficial tree is my
    primary project in the Agro-forestry sector of Peace Corps) for
    lunch, and cous-cous for dinner, followed by tea. My father is a
    White Moor. My mother is a Black Moor, on her second marriage.
    Rumor has it that she and her daughters were slaves before
    marrying my father, Moctar. One of the ways Black Moors gained
    their independence was by marrying a White Moor. There are two
    black daughters and three mixed siblings in the household. There
    is also a grandmother of Black Moor/Wolof descent. The three mixed
    siblings do the least amount of work, by far. Again the "worker
    caste" mentality fully applies, even within the family.</p>

    <p>My mother's sister lives next door to us with her whole family.
    Although we are cousins, the black children in her household are
    treated different - and it's obvious. If there is something to
    do, they are ordered to do it. What really bothers me, though, is
    when they are called, not by their real names, but by "mint
    mbarka" or "mbarak," appellations considered disparaging because
    associated with slavery - or property, so to speak. I would
    think that my family would try to treat their cousins better, or
    would shy away from this seemingly blatant racism, echoing times
    of old. Sadly to say, however, the family life I observe here has
    all become so normal to me, I could not tell you if their actions
    are justified or not, right or wrong. All moral distinctions and
    ready-made value judgments are prone to error and
    misinterpretation, especially for a foreign on-looker. I wish I
    could fully understand this "worker caste," and tell you that much
    of what we consider slavery to be is a thing of the past.
    Unfortunately, however, I am left asking many of the same
    questions as you. Will the plight of the Black Moor improve one
    day? All one can say is inshallah.</p>
