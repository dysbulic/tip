    <h4><i>March 27th 6:30 P.M.</i></h4>

    <p>Dear Michele,</p>

    <p>It is the most amazing thing to live amongst the camels and
    with people who live under tents, and to visit them at night
    drinking rounds of tea in little shot-glasses, speaking Arabic
    with them and your students stop by to practice their bad English
    on you ....</p>

    <p>There's a cool wind blowing from the West through my little
    house this late afternoon, and it's a welcomed change from the
    heat of the day. For now, it is one of the few reminders that
    there is a West.</p>

    <p>My birthday was two days ago. I asked my host mother,
    Khadijetou, to make a feast (with my money of course) so that my
    Mauritanian friends and family could celebrate with me. I gave her
    7000 UM, which is one-fourth of my monthly allowance I live on.
    But it was worth it! There were twelve of us; everyone older than
    me except my host niece at 5 years old. She's here in Maal to
    learn Classical Arabic and the Quran. We started the night by
    drinking Zriig; a tasty drink made of soured goat's milk, water,
    and sugar. Then we ate dates with cream. Next came a large platter
    of Mauritanian salad (beats, shredded carrots, tomatoes, sweet
    potato, and egg). We all dug into the platter sitting around it
    talking about how good it tasted. We never eat veggies or fruit
    out here. This conversation was in French because it is our common
    language. Not everyone speaks Hassaniya/Arabic. Sidi is Soninke,
    Dia is Pulaar, Mamadou is Wolof, Mohamed Ali is a black Moor and
    so are Hassen and my host family. They all have their own
    languages, but French unites them all. My friends are all
    teachers. The second course was an entire goat split into two
    platters toppled with slices of fried potato and a very good onion
    meat sauce. This was followed by three rounds of tea and finally
    the third course, Moroccan Couscous with carrots and more
    goat.</p>

    <p>I literally ate more that night than I do during an entire
    week! The twelve of us ate like kings even if there was no
    silverware. They don't really celebrate birthdays here, as most
    people have little clue to when they were born and at best know
    only the year and the season. They asked me about birthday
    celebrations in America and I was embarrassed to bring up alcohol
    more than once. It is, of course, forbidden in this country in
    that it is an Islamic Republic. They all thanked me for this great
    feast and I thanked Khadijetou for making it. By night's end they
    managed to sing about half of "Happy Birthday" in English before
    they realized they didn't really know the words, but the la la la
    version wasn't bad.</p>

    <p>The thing is ... If I traded $24 American dollars for Ougiya
    (UM), I would get 7000 UM and hence afford this huge feast for a
    party of twelve. I never realized how powerful the American dollar
    is in the fourth world. It is the currency the black-market in
    Nouakchott loves the best. A Ben Franklin makes for the easiest
    thing to trade in the world.</p>

    <p>The Ambassador of the United States of America to Mauritania
    was touring my part of the country and my village somehow made it
    on his list of places to stop at. It could have had something to
    do with the conversation I had with him at the Embassy after my
    speech in which I told him of Mall's beauty, though I doubt he
    remembers. At least he agrees now that Maal is beautiful. The
    Mayor, Deputy, and Hakem slaughtered five goats for his arrival
    and I got to attend this feast with the Ambassador. He arrived in
    a long procession of cars, all SUVs or Jeeps. One had the American
    flag insignia of the Peace Corps on it. For a village who rarely
    sees a car, this was a very big show. At the feast (much better
    than my birthday) I sat next to him on his left in a room of
    officials covered with a Persian-style rug. The whole room was
    decorated in Arabic purples, reeds, and burgundies. Next to me on
    my left side was the Director of the Peace Corps in Mauritania.
    Needless to say, I felt like a million bucks. After the feast I
    got into the Ambassador's car and we toured the lake and its
    gardens in this long procession of cars. I had a great
    conversation with him about Maal and fishing and then was dropped
    off in the center of the village, from where they soon drove off
    to Boghé, leaving a trailing cloud of dust in their wake. At that
    moment I had about 50 villagers come up to me in a circle as if I
    were magical. I almost felt as if they were waiting for me to say
    something very important. But I didn't. I greeted them in
    Hassaniya and walked off to my little house to eat the brownies
    and read the two copies of The New Yorker that the Ambassador gave
    to me as gifts. He really knows how to make people feel important,
    but then, that's his job.</p>

    <h4><i>March 28, 10:10 A.M.</i></h4>
    
    <p>The West wind brought dark clouds and a light rain last night.
    This morning is gray and a breeze continues to make a pleasant
    weather. Last night I fell asleep listening to the tapping rain on
    my tin roof. It reminded me of the green house when it rained in
    California on our old house.</p>

    <p>This morning a little black girl came to my door with a bowl of
    carrots and tomatoes from her mother's garden. I bought some and
    made a very good vegetable soup. My friend Sidi (the French
    teacher) stopped by about an hour ago with bread made in the mud
    ovens here and I made coffee and tea to go with the soup and
    bread. Sidi said it was the best breakfast he's had in Maal, and
    so it was with me.</p>

    <p>We talked about life; vegetable soup in England, traveling,
    growing old, raising children, and surviving day by day as a way
    of life in Africa. I know that most of what I talked about he will
    never experience. I wonder if he envies that different way of life
    impossible to him. Perhaps.</p>

    <p>I miss home. I don't miss America, I only miss being a little
    kid in Diamond Bar helping dad in the garden, running laps inside
    the swimming pool to see how fast we could make the water turn,
    playing with my G.I. Joes and toy cars, complaining about hanging
    the clothes on the clothes-line, watching cartoons with you after
    school and Star Trek with dad at night and mom walking into your
    room on your birthday in the morning singing at the top of her
    lungs. I know I am only remembering the good but this is my
    only idea of home. I don't know what it is now. The former is a
    life that is gone as much as our old house. I guess I feel
    displaced; out of time and place.</p>

    <p>I suppose out here I've had a lot of time to think about life
    ... and in a much more profound way that the busy life of L.A.
    never afforded me. I have clearly thought about what is most
    important for me; that which makes me passionate for life.</p>

    <p>First is love in all its forms ... for family, for life, and of
    course romantically. What would life be without love?</p>

    <p>Second is beauty; beauty so intense that you don't want to let
    it go.</p>

    <p>Third is the pursuit of knowledge. The more I know the more I
    am fascinated by who we are; humanity. Just to think and know
    about our long line of history and the rise and fall of the great
    civilizations blows my mind. Out here I have read a lot of
    history, literature, and about political affairs. I have followed
    closely the development of the Arab world and its clash with the
    West, and see our past colliding with our future. I know now what
    Shakespeare was thinking when Hamlet says, "What a thing is
    man..." all his plots, and wars, and struggles ... for what?
    Ideology? Land? Love? ... Survival? It amazes me what man has done
    and of what he is capable.</p>

    <p>I have now made French as natural to me as Spanish and English
    and am adding Arabic and its culture to who I am. It makes me feel
    like four persons, each as different as speaking Spanish with mom
    and speaking English with friends on a night out. Four lifetimes
    in one. Most of these villagers are blind to the outside world and
    know only what they see here. They will never know what it is like
    to eat Chinese food with chopsticks or what the world looks like
    through the window of an airplane, or what it is like to have
    thousands of spectators clapping after your performance, nor will
    they stop and wonder what the last Caesar was thinking/feeling as
    he watched the Visigoths pour over the hill and into Rome! When I
    say knowledge I include experience of life and travel.</p>

    <p>Both of these lead to adventure. By this I don't mean "Raiders
    of the Lost Arc." Very few of us can ever experience that. By
    adventure I mean the undiscovered. We all know Robert Frost's
    little line "And so I chose the road less traveled, and that has
    made all the difference." Adventure is a leap of faith into a
    place, or employment, or existence in which you have no idea what
    to expect. Mystery. The voyage of self-discovery. It is the way I
    felt at the airport just before I walked into the plane and said
    good-bye to Larisa. And again I felt that way in Boghé when a
    Mauritanian boy in tattered clothes told me in Africanized French
    to follow him, that I would be living with him now, and I
    completely stepped out of my known world. It is that feeling heavy
    in your stomach and light on your shoulders that keeps you asking
    "What the hell am I doing?" It is the ultimate reminder that you
    are truly alive.</p>

    <p>I told Larisa at LAX that if I died right then that I would be
    satisfied that I had lived a full life. I said this looking into
    her eyes aware of all the love I had for her, remembering my
    childhood adventures, the students that cried for me as I did for
    them, flying over a car during a motorcycle accident, driving
    myself on the wrong side of the car in England, getting lost in
    the mountains of France and California, singing in front of a
    packed hall, and flying to Pittsburgh to find a lost love. And I
    turned away from Larisa and looked towards the airplane and said
    to her ... "the craziest part of it all is that my life will
    really begin once I step onto that airplane."</p>

    <p>And so it has ....</p>
