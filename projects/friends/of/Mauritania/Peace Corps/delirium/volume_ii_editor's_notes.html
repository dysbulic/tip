    <h1>Note from an Editor</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>We all witness <em>delirium</em>. We share the experience of
    this place in our sites, our communities, our region, our country
    of service. Sometimes we brag. Sometimes we only search out a
    laugh, sometimes we search support, sometimes the experience is so
    embarrassing that it is difficult to actually admit. By now we
    have all lived through at least one hot season, one experience of
    training and adjustment, one taxi brousse voyage, and we all have
    our stories to tell. Our very own Country Directrice Kateri
    Clement herself has had a famous account from her Peace Corps
    service. Her’s is a story told in second person where she claims
    to have found a fellow volunteer, one who tended to refuse all
    “unnecessary” amenities (e.g. – electricity, beds, house made of
    anything other than mud and straw), curled up, naked, in the
    coolest shaded corner of a hut—crying. Breaking point: that
    asphyxiating moment when it is not just the heat that bothers us
    anymore. And the <em>delirium</em> sets in.</p>

    <p>We can all share with each other, because we have all sensed
    our own particular <em>delirium</em>. We can share these moments
    of emotion, frustration, anger, peace, embarrassment that are
    sometimes joyful, sometimes sorrowful, sometimes neither or both.
    Sometimes the <em>delirium</em> starts with that contagious,
    maddening laughter over something so trivial for the mere sake of
    being one amongst a crowd. Sometimes it is the heat and the
    invited pleas from a colleague to “get up, brush off, put on some
    clothes and come join everyone else in front of the fan,” that
    notices our <em>delirium</em> so that we realize it for ourselves.
    <em>Delirium</em> is connected to the realization of place. It is
    the effects of the place in which we find ourselves, along with
    the way we interact with the company in which we find ourselves,
    that determines a state of mind. <em>Delirium</em> is the way that
    life in this place makes us feel.</p>

    <p>And it is <em>Delirium</em> the literary journal that attempts
    to provide an outlet. It attempts a glimpse at the insanity, for
    better or for worse, that we’ve all married ourselves to. It is a
    glimpse of life in this place, from the eyes, hands, pens and
    journals of volunteers, that nudges at the re-evaluation of self
    for which <em>delirium</em> calls. Our <em>Delirium</em> strives
    to illustrate a common condition that is full of joyous qualities
    as well as spectacular faults.</p>

    <p>And so with the second, long awaited, volume of
    <em>Delirium</em>, now provided to you in a new on-line format and
    dedicated to a true enlightening mentor of academia, the great
    philosophical conversationalist himself, and creator/original
    editor of this literary journal - Mauritanian RPCV Paul Woolridge,
    I extend the invitation and promote any further submissions to the
    up-and-coming third edition ... inshallah. Please submit, by
    attachment to an email, such material to <a
    href="mailto:wittdmc@yahoo.com">wittdmc@yahoo.com</a> and/or
    someone else in country who is interested. This small project is a
    privilege and so much thanks goes to Paul W. for providing the
    original idea and format, then passing it along. Its potential to
    expand on the experience that <em>is</em> Peace Corps knows no
    bounds. Thanks also goes to Alden Kline who has found time away
    from her usual Nouakchott Notes staff in order to lend her strict
    editing skills to our delirious compilation, and to Audrey Bottjen
    for the insightful entry on drunken conversations. Convincing!</p>
