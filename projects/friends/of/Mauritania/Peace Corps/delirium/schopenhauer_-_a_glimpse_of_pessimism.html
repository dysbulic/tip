    <h1>A Glimpse of Pessimism</h1>
    <h3>Arthur Schopenhauer</h3>
    <hr />
    <p><em>[Excerpts from <u>The World As Will And Representation;
    volume two</u>, by Arthur Schopenhauer.]</em></p>

    <h4>On the Fundamental View of Idealism:</h4>

    <p>In endless space countless luminous spheres, round each of
    which some dozen smaller illuminated ones revolve, hot at the core
    and covered over with a hard cold crust; on this crust a mouldy
    film has produced living and knowing beings: this is empirical
    truth, the real, the world. Yet for a being who thinks, it is a
    precarious position to stand on one of those numberless spheres
    freely floating in boundless space, without knowing whence or
    whither, and to be only one of innumerable similar beings that
    throng, press, and toil, restlessly and rapidly arising and
    passing away in beginningless and endless time. Here there is
    nothing permanent but matter alone, and the recurrence of the same
    varied organic forms by means of certain ways and channels that
    inevitable exist as they do. All that empirical science can teach
    is only the more precise nature and rule of these events. But at
    last the philosophy of modern times, especially through Berkeley
    and Kant, has called to mind that all this in the first instance
    is only phenomenon of the brain, and is encumbered by so many
    great and different subjective conditions that its supposed
    absolute reality vanishes, and leaves room for an entirely
    different world-order that lies at the root of that phenomenon, in
    other words, is related to it as the thing-in-itself to the mere
    appearance... "The world is my representation" is, like the
    axioms of Euclid, a proposition which everyone must recognize as
    true as soon as he understands it, although it is not a
    proposition that everyone understands as soon as he hears it.</p>

    <h4>On the Vanity and Suffering of Life</h4>

    <p>Awakened to life out of the night of unconsciousness, the will
    finds itself as an individual in an endless and boundless world,
    among innumerable individuals, all striving, suffering, and
    erring; and, as if through a troubled dream, it hurries back to
    the old unconsciousness. Yet till then its desires are unlimited,
    its claims inexhaustible, and every satisfied desire gives birth
    to a new one. No possible satisfaction in the world could suffice
    to still its craving, set a final goal to its commands, and fill
    the bottomless pit of its heart. In this connexion, let us now
    consider what as a rule comes to man in satisfactions of any kind;
    it is often nothing more than the bare maintenance of this very
    existence, extorted daily with unremitting effort and constant
    care in conflict with misery and want and with death in prospect.
    Everything in life proclaims that earthly happiness is destined to
    be frustrated, or recognized as an illusion. The grounds for this
    lie deep in the very nature of things. Accordingly, the lives of
    most people prove troubled and short. The comparatively happy are
    often only apparently so, or else, like those of long life, they
    are rare exceptions; the possibility of these still had to be
    left, as decoy-birds. Life presents itself as a continual
    deception, in small matters as well as in great. If it has
    promised, it does not keep its word, unless to show how little
    desirable the desired object was; hence we are deluded now by
    hope, now by what was hoped for. If it has given, it did so in
    order to take. The enchantment of distance shows us paradises that
    vanish like optical illusions, when we have allowed ourselves to
    be fooled by them. Accordingly, happiness lies always in the
    future, or else in the past, and the present may be compared to a
    small dark cloud driven by the wind over the sunny plain; in front
    of and behind the cloud everything is bright, only it itself
    always casts a shadow. Consequently, the present is always
    inadequate, but the future uncertain, and the past irrecoverable.
    With its misfortunes, small, greater, and great, occurring hourly,
    daily, weekly, and yearly; with its deluded hopes and accidents
    bringing all calculations to nought, life bears so clearly the
    stamp of something which ought to disgust us, that it is difficult
    to see how anyone could fail to recognize this, and be persuaded
    that life is here to be thankfully enjoyed, and that man exists in
    order to be happy. On the contrary, that continual deception and
    disillusionment, as well as the general nature of life, present
    themselves as intended and calculated to awaken the conviction
    that nothing whatever is worth our exertions, our efforts, and our
    struggles, that all good things are empty and fleeting, that the
    world on all sides is bankrupt, and that life is a business that
    does not cover the costs; so that our will may turn away from
    it.</p>
