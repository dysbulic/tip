    <h1>Go to the Cult</h1>
    <h3>Matthew C.</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>She wakes him with a sigh. He begins to stir from a quick sleep
    and he opens his eyes to the scenery. If he trusted where he were,
    he could look out and enjoy the ocean, as well as the sand that
    comes off the dune, and twists down the beach. But he feels
    uneasiness. He feels it in the tightness of his joints. And he
    doesn't feel rested even after sleeping for an hour, as if some
    enzyme has not been released that would give the easy sensation of
    having gained sleep.</p>

    <p>"I still feel filthy from that ferry ride. I don't know what I
    was expecting from an Italian ferry," he says.</p>

    <p>"I can't tell. Or you don't smell it. Or you smell like you
    belong to me." "You look like someone who belongs," he rolls unto
    his stomach and rests his chin on her naked belly. "You have brown
    eyes, and you're brown all over. Everything agrees."</p>

    <p>She scratches her breast and turns her head toward the ocean
    and looks out across the dune, at the stark white saline of the
    sand that flows down into the ocean and at an ugly, half dead
    tree. She doesn't want to think about his expression for very
    long. "Maybe he had an ugly dream," she thinks, "maybe with this
    ugly tree in it and maybe a funeral." She sighs again, finding her
    view of ocean, among other things, to be beautiful. And then she
    turns back towards him and almost stares at him.</p>

    <p>Although the sun still has hours in the sky, it is not hot.
    Against the cold wind from the sea, it gives a deep warm on their
    faces. He also feels a different warmth: the warmth of being
    looked at, of knowing that someone else is searching for an
    expression and wondering what caused it. He feels the need for
    talk, and at that instant she says, "I like it here."</p>

    <p>"It was that old professor in Palermo that told me to visit
    this place."</p>

    <p>"I feel good, and I don't want to move for a long
    time."</p>

    <p>"Yes, this place is nice. That professor, Paolo, he told me so
    many stories, about traveling. It seemed like he just made things
    up. Like he was bored or I was bored." He considered that she
    might not want to hear about his professor. She turns to him,
    surprising him with a look of interest.</p>

    <p>"Yes, a feeling of being lied to?"</p>

    <p>"Not so much lied to. His whole talk just still bothers me. It
    didn't seem real. He told me to come here, while talking about
    going to the Black Madonna churches on these islands."</p>

    <p>"That cult."</p>

    <p>"Yes. I remember his words so clearly, 'imagine an ancient
    Mediterranean peasant woman on a donkey cart, on a rocky,
    desolate path next to the ocean, with her child on her lap. The
    cart hits a bump, and the child is dropped, and falls toward the
    ocean. But before it hits the water, a column of earth rises out
    of the ocean, cradling and returning the child to the mother.' And
    then Paolo tries to shock you, he almost tries to scare you, and
    so he says that the mother is terrorized by the experience and
    loses her wits to the secret cause of her child's life. She
    abandons it at the nearest church, and the statues of Mary shed a
    black tear. It's only a story, I guess. He just tries to get at
    you."</p>

    <p>"Still. It bothers you, yet you don't want to forget?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know."</p>

    <p>"You do to know. You listened to him. You came here, right?"
    Now it is he who gazes out at the sea and sighs, not realizing he
    mimicked the sigh that she woke him with a few moments
    earlier.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I'm here, and the water looks pretty good from here."</p>

    <p>"We need a swim."</p>
