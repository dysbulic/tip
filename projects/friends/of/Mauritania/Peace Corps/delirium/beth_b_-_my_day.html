    <h1>My Day</h1>
    <h2>Impressions</h2>
    <h3>Beth B.</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>I wake up to the sounds of roosters and donkeys and the swelter
    of extreme heat. Can the day really begin this early I ask myself?
    A lukewarm bucket bath washes away the sweat and sand momentarily.
    I leave my house and start towards the center of town. It's a
    windy day with a little bit of dust in the air &mdash; not what I
    would call a beautiful day, but I've seen worse. On my way to town
    I meet Zeinabou and Fatimatu and then Miriam and Khatu. I see
    Mohamed, Sidi and Ahmed as well as Tutu and Ishe. How are you?
    Your family? Health? Work? How is your morning? Anything new? I am
    fine. All is good. Thank you, thank you.</p>

    <p>It's time for tea. Round one. Round two. Round three. Why
    aren't I married? Where is my husband? Don't I want to marry a man
    from Chinguitti? How about the camel herder? Or the brother? Maybe
    the butcher? When I leave, will I ever come back? Do I know
    Mohamed the Prophet? Do I pray? Muhlafas are good, why don't you
    wear a muhlafa? </p>

    <p>The sun is rising, it is nearly noon. I make my way back across
    town to my "sister's" boutique. Take the milk, drink, drink more,
    it is hot today. How are you? Where have you been? Did you hear
    about Hamid and Nina? They are getting married next week.</p>

    <p>Back to the house. Wash our hands, gather round, the plate of
    food is here. Rice. Rice and meat. Could that be camel? Eat. Eat
    more. Why aren't you eating? Don't you like it? Eat. Eat. Eat.
    Wash our hands again. Time to relax. We pull out the pillows, find
    a comfy position and it's nap time. </p>

    <p>I must have fallen asleep because it is mid afternoon now. Does
    it ever cool down here? Time for tea. Round one. Round two. Round
    three. I start to wake up, the grogginess is wearing off. I wander
    back to my house. What to do? I will read, no I will knit, no I
    will clean, no I will write a letterÂ…</p>

    <p>I go to visit my friend Mariem. Let's have tea. Round one.
    Round two. Round three. How are you? How is your health? Your
    family? The work? How is the heat? Are you fine? Yes, I am fine.
    My family is fine. Work is good. The heat, the heat is okay.
    What's new? Your sister is getting married? When? I will come to
    the wedding, I will wear a muhlafa and dance. </p>

    <p>The sun is setting as I walk back towards home. Glowing orange
    and red over the sand dunes and a palm tree reaches up in the
    middle of it. Beautiful. There is my family, sitting in the sand
    outside the boutique. Hello. How are you? It is hot today. Yes, it
    is hot in America sometimes. We sleep inside and everyone has
    their own room. It is different than here. Do I prefer America or
    Mauritania? They are not the same. I love America but I love
    Mauritania as well.</p>

    <p>Time for tea. Round one. Round two. Round three. Here comes the
    couscous. Eat. Eat. Eat some more. Thank you. I am tired, I am
    going to sleep now. Good night. I walk back to my house. Where is
    my candle? There, now I can see. Pajamas. Mattress. Sheet. Pillow.
    I blow out my candle and settle into my matela. Looking up all I
    see are stars and the white smear of the Milky Way. A shooting
    star! Cassiopeia. Orion. Stars. Stars. Stars.</p>

    <p>As I fall asleep under my blanket of stars I am happy to be
    here, happy to be in a place where it is more important to greet
    your neighbor than to be on time. So, good night Mauritania, good
    night Milky Way, good night shooting stars &mdash; I'll see you
    again tomorrow.</p>
