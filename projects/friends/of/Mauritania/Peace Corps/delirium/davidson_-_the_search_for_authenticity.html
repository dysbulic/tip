    <h1>The Search for Authenticity</h1>
    <h3>Jay Davidson</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>My invitation to serve in the Peace Corps arrived seven months
    before I left for Mauritania. I received not only a detailed
    description of the job I would do, but its location; my work with
    the national Ministry of Education necessitated being placed in
    Nouakchott, the capital, with its population that includes a fair
    number of aid organizations and embassies, including their
    expatriate employees and diplomats. Calling it "cosmopolitan"
    would be a stretch, but it is certainly the most diverse city in
    the country.</p>

    <p>In contrast, my fellow Trainees arrived with no idea where they
    would be stationed &mdash; nor would they find out until training
    was more than half over. Many of them could count on living in
    villages with no electricity or running water. During our first
    week in-country, one of them, in the Agfo (Agriculture-forestry)
    program, assured of living in a remote region because of his work,
    informed me that he was "going to be out in the bush with the real
    Volunteers."</p>

    <p>This was the first time that I had heard such a comparison
    &mdash; that some of the Volunteers would be any more "real" than
    any others. There was something, at least in the mind of this
    Trainee, that told him that his experience in Mauritania would be
    more difficult, less comfortable, and, therefore, more "real,"
    more "authentic" than that of us who would be living "the easy
    life" in the capital.</p>

    <p>I have come to think of this as "the search for authenticity."
    Deprivation, and the suffering that ensues, are the hallmark of
    those Volunteers in this quest. Those who are the most deprived,
    those who suffer the most, are, therefore, the "real"
    Volunteers.</p>

    <p>Never mind that our Macho Man who made this statement &mdash;
    he being a former soldier and police officer &mdash; didn't manage
    to make it through one week of training in the desert heat before
    he packed it in and went home to his mother.</p>

    <p>From what part of the American psyche comes that "real
    Volunteers" judgment? We are all "in the same boat," having left
    our families, friends, and comforts in the United States, yet
    somebody needs to one-up an equal with this terminology.</p>

    <p>With some thought, I have what may not be the answer, but it is
    one that helps to frame this for me. It lies in the omnipresent
    competition in which most Americans are compelled to participate.
    Take a look at every segment of American society &mdash;
    especially sports and the entertainment industry &mdash; and you
    see not only a national obsession with winning and losing, but a
    world view that is based on it. Every athletic competition is part
    of a ritual that ultimately leads to a championship. Every form of
    entertainment is eligible for some sort of "Best" award.
    Ultimately, all participants are reduced to being either winners
    or losers.</p>

    <p>(For the sake of this essay, I am taking a neutral position on
    the phenomenon of competition itself. Rather than praise it as
    necessary or condemn it as useless, I am simply acknowledging its
    existence. At the same time, I say unequivocally that I am wholly
    disinterested in competitive endeavors such as sports, either as a
    participant or as an observer. I respect those of you who opine
    that competition has its place in our society, or even that people
    are "naturally competitive," as I have heard many people claim. I
    am sure that this is as true for those who say it, as it is untrue
    for me.)</p>

    <p>In any event, the American spirit of competition is as potent
    and prevalent as it is portable. It is understandable that
    Volunteers have, therefore, brought it with them to Mauritania,
    and they are using it to make comparisons of their sites to those
    of the other Volunteers. The competition is for the badge of
    "authenticity," with its resulting decision that some have "won,"
    while others have "lost" this distinction.</p>

    <p>The competition is being waged on three fronts: (1) on the
    national scale, it is between every site and Nouakchott; (2)
    within the capital, it is from one quartier to another; (3) on the
    international level, Volunteers who complete their service in the
    RIM pride themselves as having survived in a country with among
    the highest dropout rate of all Peace Corps countries.</p>

    <p>In considering how I could get my mind wrapped around this
    matter, I decided to begin by taking a look at the goals of the
    Peace Corps. This has helped me not only to focus on my work here,
    but also to see how I fit into the "search for authenticity." As
    stated in Peace Corps literature, its mission is centered around
    three goals:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>To help the people of interested countries and areas in
      meeting their needs for trained men and women;</li>
      <li>To help promote a better understanding of the American
      people on the part of the peoples served;</li>
      <li>To help promote a better understanding of other peoples on
      the part of the American people.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>As I peruse these statements, I notice that there is no mention
    of suffering, pain, hardship, or deprivation in the execution of
    these goals. In that respect, it bears a striking similarity to
    our lives before, after, with, or without the Peace Corps:
    suffering is optional.</p>

    <p>We Volunteers are left to our own devices not only with the
    implementation of the goals, but also in the choices that we make
    in determining what constitutes an "authentic" experience. Because
    inviting countries ask for people to be placed in rural as well as
    city settings, and since the Peace Corps agrees to match Invitees'
    skills to the tasks that have to be done, there has to be a wide
    range of sites and people in order to meet the needs for training
    the men and women who live in the countries served.</p>

    <p>Integrating into the host society is a large theme in Peace
    Corps life. Any number of cross-cultural sessions during PST
    reflect the need of the Volunteers' awareness of issues regarding
    local customs. "Fitting in," though, becomes a delicate balance,
    and there are many ways in which to do it. After all, since one of
    the goals is to help Host Country Nationals (HCNs) to understand
    American people, how do we do that if we drop all of our
    Americanisms and adopt only the HCNs' ways of doing things?</p>

    <p>During training, several Trainees purchased fabric and engaged
    tailors to make clothing that reflect local design. There were
    also Trainees who continued to dress only in the garments that
    they brought from home.</p>

    <p>We have to decide for ourselves what apparel feels appropriate
    and what does not; there is neither a "right" or a "wrong" choice.
    Personally, I have purchased and comfortably wear a few complets
    and a kaftan; in doing so, I feel natural as I walk the streets of
    Nouakchott and visit the homes of Mauritanian friends. At the same
    time, there is something that stops me from wearing a boubou.</p>

    <p>During Ramadan, several of our Volunteers fasted during
    daylight hours, as is the stricture from the Koran. They said that
    they wanted to experience what it was like for the people with
    whom they are living and working. This is a totally valid
    perspective on their part, in that it is not possible to
    understand an experience until a person has it.</p>

    <p>It is equally valid for any of us to say, "I am not a Muslim.
    Ramadan is not part of my religious tradition. I am not going to
    fast."</p>

    <p>One principle by which PCVs are supposed to ascribe is that we
    live at the economic level of the people whom we serve. This is an
    especially thorny issue, first of all, because we Volunteers
    receive a living allowance that is greater than the salaries of
    many highly educated Mauritanian professionals!</p>

    <p>To live at the level of the HCNs, should we send home our
    Walkman CD players, digital cameras, and laptops? Do we give up
    e-mail for two years because most HCNs don't have it? Do we ask
    our family and friends not to send us packages because they
    contain items that HCNs cannot afford to purchase? Do we stop
    taking vacations in Europe and the United States because HCNs
    can't do that?</p>

    <p>Even if we did give up all these trappings, there is no denying
    that each one of us, by virtue of being college-educated American
    citizens, has the promise of a rewarding future with material
    wealth and comforts that most of our Mauritanian friends will
    experience only as observers. Any one of us could go right ahead
    and eat that couscous and goat meat every day for two years,
    feeling as "authentic" as we want, and still know that the
    experience is as limited as our stay here. Whether we finish our
    two years, extend to three, or decide to leave tomorrow, we will
    fly away from it all with a free ticket to a home that offers more
    opportunities than most HCNs ever will dream of.</p>

    <p>I maintain that if we are to continue our "search for
    authenticity," that it be within the parameters of the Peace Corps
    goals &mdash; especially the second one, in which we "promote a
    better understanding of the American people on the part of the
    peoples served." In doing so, our greatest responsibility with
    regard to our living and working with HCNs is to be as
    authentically ourselves as we can be. Not only will we better
    serve our Mauritanian friends and co-workers that way, but we have
    a better chance to circumvent the inevitable stress that results
    when we pretend not to be who we really are, whether we are a
    "typical American" or different, and whether that difference is
    subtle or blatant.</p>

    <p>Any one of us could live here for the rest of our lives and
    never be considered a Mauritanian, regardless of religious
    conversion, perfection of language skills, clothing that we wear,
    or the food that we eat. There is a gift in knowing and accepting
    this to be the truth, and that gift is the comfort that comes with
    allowing ourselves to relax into being exactly who we are. How
    does that play out for you? For me, there are a few unavoidable
    aspects of my life that have continually come to the fore. I share
    them here with you:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>As a vegetarian, I don't force my views on Mauritanians, but
      I explain to them that this is a healthy way of eating that has
      been working well for me since 1971. Why not have them meet an
      American who does not eat hamburgers and drink Coca Cola?</li>
      <li>I enjoy reading much more than watching television. My Kaédi
      host family had their television on most of the day. There were
      five children in that household. Just because the TV was on
      didn't mean that I wanted to watch it. Why not show them, by my
      example, that reading books is a pleasurable activity? When we
      talk about it, I also let them know that at home, in the USA, I
      don't own a television.</li>
      <li>I have also had the occasion to introduce my "authentic"
      self to fellow Volunteers. Being a naturally early riser, I feel
      my best when I get to sleep by ten o'clock in the evening. I'm
      going to be awake by 6:30 AM whether I go to bed early or late,
      so I may as well be rested. As a result, I don't attend the
      parties that my fellow Volunteers enjoy &mdash; not because I
      don't appreciate their company, but because my body is working
      on a different rhythm.</li>
      <li>I accept that I am hopelessly "out of the loop" on many
      occasions. Mob scene party and sporting events don't appeal to
      me, which is why I have avoided the ones that most fellow PCVs
      enjoy. Most of the popular culture names, events, and music that
      the PCVs talk about are alien to me.</li>
      <li>I am most comfortable &mdash; both with myself and in
      relationships &mdash; when I am honest about who I am. That is
      what contributes to my personal sense of authenticity. In this
      regard, I felt compelled to share with my fellow Trainees and
      Volunteers that I am gay and Jewish, which puts me in the
      minority in even more ways than the ones I have already
      described. I am saddened by the advice from Peace Corps that I
      not disclose this information to HCNs. At the same time, I feel
      that I will probably take the opportunity to do this before I
      close service.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>As I observe behavior of those around me, I can't help but
    notice the movement that we as Volunteers and the Mauritanians
    around us are making toward each other. On our part, we have been
    making many changes in our daily lives: drinking the tea, eating
    the food, speaking the languages, wearing the clothing, showing up
    late to meetings &mdash; in all, taking upon ourselves the aspects
    of everyday Mauritanian life.</p>

    <p>While we are engaged in adapting to local practices,
    Mauritanians are leaving the desert in favor of cities, trading in
    their camels for cars, and expanding their networks of water,
    electricity, and cell phones. With greater numbers of people
    watching television, they are increasingly being exposed to images
    of the "good life," generally proferred by movies and shows
    emanating from France, Brazil, South Africa, and Senegal.</p>

    <p>Stop for a second. Take a breath and a good hard look. Do you
    see what is happening? We are trying to become more like them,
    while they are putting their energies into being more like us! In
    the exchange, each group is taking on characteristics and
    behaviors of the other. Who is remaining not only "authentic," but
    "authentically" what?</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the matter of our being "real" Volunteers must
    depend exclusively on our individual implementation of the goals
    as set forth by the Peace Corps: (1) the quality of the work that
    we do in transferring our skills; (2) the authentic sharing of
    ourselves with the people we meet here; and (3) an accurate
    portrayal of our lives to family and friends at home.</p>

    <p>This is an issue that deserves our individual and collective
    consideration. Living our lives with awareness leads to living
    them with intention. It is through our intention that we create
    the opportunity to make a difference in a world that needs as much
    help as we can offer it.</p>
