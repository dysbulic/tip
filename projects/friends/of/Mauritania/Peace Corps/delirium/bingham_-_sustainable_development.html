    <h1>Sustainable Development</h1>
    <h3>Racy Bingham</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>I didn't have many expectations before coming to Mauritania, or
    so I thought. I now realize that I had quite a few. I imagined
    that the desert would be a hard place to live in. I expected Peace
    Corps to drop off its volunteers in remote villages, not to be
    seen by other Americans for over two years. I expected language to
    be the ultimate key to cultural integration. Above all, I expected
    every Mauritanian to jump at the chance to work with me, a Peace
    Corps Volunteer, ready and willing to help. I was going to teach
    them how to use their local resources more efficiently in order to
    improve their standard of living. I was thrilled at the prospect
    of doing "sustainable development!" Unfortunately, after two years
    of doing what the twenty-first century calls "sustainable
    development," I realize that what in fact I was trying to do was
    to teach my village how to exploit the resources they already had
    in ways that would make their shops more prosperous, their
    children more marketable in the global economy, and their
    community more materially comfortable (and hopefully, but not
    necessarily, more peaceful).</p>

    <p>Peace Corps throughout the world, along with other grass roots
    and non-profit organizations, is guilty of making "sustainable
    development" a matter of economics, rather than a means to peace
    and permanence. We act as if growth, expansion, and development
    are all possible in a finite environment, that is, an environment
    of limited trees, water, animals, rains and land. The original
    idea behind sustainable development is the belief that
    environmental growth and resource development, when brought to a
    sufficient level of production, eventually reaches an equilibrium;
    the participating organizations who had helped the struggling
    community attain a certain degree of self-sufficiency, would then
    head home proud of the peace and environmental prosperity
    supposedly reached. But in reality, growth will never be
    enough.</p>

    <p>We have been taught in school, in Peace Corps training, and
    through our own experiences, that the "donne moi dix" trend is
    typical of developing countries which have received aid for
    extended periods of time. However, has any industrialized country
    ever been known to say, for example, "thank you, we have enough
    oil"? Has any large-scale corporation ever been known to say "we
    are closing business because we've made enough money"? The level
    of need for developing environments is basic and easy to
    recognize. We naturally sympathize with the needy and want to
    help. However, in helping them meet their basic needs, we actually
    create more needs, disrupting the stability of families,
    communities and countries, moving us farther and farther away from
    our initial goal: peace. Never will any rich country, nor will any
    poor country, say they've experienced enough economic growth.
    Therefore, it seems, life will be forever unstable and peace
    illusive.</p>

    <p>E.F Schumacher in his book <u>Small Is Beautiful</u> asks
    whether the rich or the poor treasure peace more highly? Are we
    less able to live in peace because we are afraid of losing it? We
    must continuously stay on our toes to compete with other
    consumers, producers, manufacturers, dictators in oil rich
    countries, and angry terrorists playing off the need for security
    in poorer populations. Do the poorer communities live more
    peacefully because they possess a greater sense of equilibrium
    with what sustains their existence? Sustainable development,
    centered around the economic motive for prosperity, seems only to
    have increased the needs of poorer populations. They are no longer
    able nor willing to say: enough. If we continue to work believing
    that sustainable development means economic development, life in
    Mauritania and in other developing countries will remain unstable,
    furthering rather than eliminating potential problems. The natural
    peace born from living off what the environment can reasonably
    sustain will falter, giving rise to a higher degree of civil
    unrest, and keeping us from achieving our intended goal:
    peace.</p>

    <p>So now what is to be done? I am in Mauritania one more year,
    and I still have time to change my modus operandi. However, even
    though I see the pitfalls of what we do as development workers, I
    can't think of a better alternative. The desire to make people's
    lives more comfortable is a noble sentiment. It leaves me to
    wonder, how is one to balance the desire for immediate
    gratification with the longer term goal of peace.</p>
