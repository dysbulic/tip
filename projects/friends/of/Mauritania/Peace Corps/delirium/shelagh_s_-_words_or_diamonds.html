        <span class="poem line1">If you have a diamond, it's just one.</span>
        <span class="poem line1">You have it, and no one else does.</span>
        <span class="poem line1">It can't grow and make more diamonds,</span>
        <span class="poem line1">And if you lose it, it's gone.</span>

        <span class="poem line1">Millions of people can use the same word,</span>

        <span class="poem line1">Words contain ideas.</span>
        <span class="poem line1">The more words you know,</span>
        <span class="poem line1">The more ideas you can have.</span>
        <span class="poem line1">With ideas, you can do almost anything.</span>
        <span class="poem line1">If you have many diamonds, but no ideas,</span>
        <span class="poem line1">You are not rich.</span>
