        <span class="poem line1">I came with two hands</span>
        <span class="poem line1">each tipped with sharp fingers</span>
        <span class="poem line1">to help a zebra people</span>
        <span class="poem line1">who long ago decided to </span>
        <span class="poem line1">separate their colors</span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">They gave me a sun-blistered tongue</span>
        <span class="poem line1">that belonged to a departed step-mother</span>
        <span class="poem line1">and was told to talk</span>
        <span class="poem line1">to the father remaining</span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">No one understands</span>
        <span class="poem line1">why the donkeys sing</span>
        <span class="poem line1">but I am here anyway</span>
        <span class="poem line1">and can tell you why</span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">With a word</span>
        <span class="poem line1">that I can't find in my concrete</span>
        <span class="poem line1">monk's cell with</span>
        <span class="poem line1">a lizard's skull ensconced somewhere in the wall</span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">Because my mouth</span>
        <span class="poem line1">with its borrowed tongue</span>
        <span class="poem line1">can't make the sound</span>
        <span class="poem line1">that blew over the next dune</span>
      </p>

    <div id="column2">
      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">To land at the feet</span>
        <span class="poem line1">of a man whose face</span>
        <span class="poem line1">I can't see, so I don't</span>
        <span class="poem line1">ask because I will never know him </span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">As I know my black love</span>
        <span class="poem line1">my howli</span>
        <span class="poem line1">wrapped around the gum Arabic encrusted secret</span>
        <span class="poem line1">always wanted to find</span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">Like the ants</span>
        <span class="poem line1">always want my bread</span>
        <span class="poem line1">but stopped by the universal RIM-grass</span>
        <span class="poem line1">a plastic bag</span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">like me, neither iron nor skin</span>
        <span class="poem line1">therefore imported and foreign</span>
        <span class="poem line1">and holding a STATE</span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">of VISA or hope or boredom</span>
        <span class="poem line1">or another sovereign emotion</span>
        <span class="poem line1">belonging to the plastic foto</span>
        <span class="poem line1">identification</span>
        <span class="poem line1">with two sharp hands</span>
