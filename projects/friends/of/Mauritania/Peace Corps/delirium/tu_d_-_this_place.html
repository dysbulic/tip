    <h1>This Place</h1>
    <h3>Tu D.</h3>
    <hr />
    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">There is something about this place.</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Whether man or woman, it leaves us mystified.</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Sometimes we walk with our heads down and ears closed</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Trying to keep from shedding a tear the very next day</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">Sometimes we walk forward</span>
      <span class="poem line1">As the sun blinds our very thought of sight</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Walking in a direction forever aimless</span>
      <span class="poem line1">While the coastal winds bring the scent of rotten death</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Washed up along the shores</span>
      <span class="poem line1">And the evening call to prayer haunts our very conscience</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Sometimes we desire to leave so much that it pains to crave,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Most of the time we want nothing more to do with it.</span>
      <span class="poem line1">To leave and never come back.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">But every time there is this irresistible yearning</span>
      <span class="poem line1">A lingering nostalgia for frozen minutes, even seconds</span>
      <span class="poem line1">For the familiarity of dirty hands and tired faces</span>
      <span class="poem line1">That leave a sigh of unknowing relief</span>
      <span class="poem line1">The thoughts of endless days</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Toiling through the heat with nothing to do.</span>
      <span class="poem line1">The thought of wasting away in acrid sweat</span>
      <span class="poem line1">While swatting away the madness of flies</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Who want, like us, nothing more than to find refuge from uncertainty</span>
      <span class="poem line1">To be so far away, but forgetting why we leave in the first place.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">For each day is just like the next</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Nothing more and nothing less</span>
      <span class="poem line1">The days become longer and longer</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Drowning our every desire to move</span>
      <span class="poem line1">From the shade that keeps us cool</span>
      <span class="poem line1">And brings us reason when the piss encrusted</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Stench becomes too putrid to endure</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Another night of insomniac headlights glaring</span>
      <span class="poem line1">In man-made city streets with borrowed tears</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Whispering goodnight to a land forgotten</span>
      <span class="poem line1">With the moment that failed to stay.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">Our ephemeral existence in a place with no ground</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Maybe, that is the mystery of this place</span>
      <span class="poem line1">To never truly know one's place</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Between the everlasting horizon</span>
      <span class="poem line1">And the deep blue of the shifting sands</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Where pyramids have been built and disappeared</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Where sphinx have landed and bred their children</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Where men have walked with no traces of footsteps left behind</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Nothing is ever permanent but perhaps</span>
      <span class="poem line1">For the believer that has carried us this far</span>
      <span class="poem line1">In God's vast and great land.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">Even the idea of love seems to be from a distant imagination</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Like a lush oasis full of camels guided by strong hands</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Whose soft caress shapes the endless mounds</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Of  skin-coloured sands shifting in motion</span>
      <span class="poem line1">As if losing shadows never to be found again</span>
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">And the next traveler will bury his hurt deep</span>
      <span class="poem line1">Within the warm comfort of a mother's embrace</span>
      <span class="poem line1">In silence, so that the sun can rise</span>
      <span class="poem line1">To know that love is seeing.</span>
      <span class="poem line1">In this mystical place that breaks our hearts</span>
      <span class="poem line1">And inspires our soul.</span>
    </p>
