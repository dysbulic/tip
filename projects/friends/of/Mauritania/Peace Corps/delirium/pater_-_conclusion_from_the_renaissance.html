    <h1>Conclusion from <u>The Renaissance</u></h1>
    <h3>Walter Pater</h3>
    <hr />
    <p><em>Walter Pater is the eminent aesthetic philosopher-critic of
    the late Victorian world, an advocate of art for art's sake. The
    selection below reprints his famous "manifesto," banned from print
    for fear that it would unduly influence impressionable young
    Oxford minds with its Epicurean values.</em></p>

    <p>To regard all things and principles of things as inconstant
    modes or fashions has more and more become the tendency of modern
    thought. Let us begin with that which is without&mdash;our physical
    life. Fix upon it in one of its more exquisite intervals, the
    moment, for instance, of delicious recoil from the flood of water
    in summer heat. What is the whole physical life in that moment but
    a combination of natural elements to which science gives their
    names? But those elements, phosphorous and lime and delicate
    fibers, are present not in the human body alone: we detect them in
    place most remote from it. Our physical life is a perpetual motion
    of them&mdash;the passage of the blood, the waste and repairing of
    the lenses of the eye, the modification of the tissues of the
    brain under every ray of light and sound&mdash;processes which
    science reduces to simpler and more elementary forces. Like the
    elements of which we are composed, the action of these forces
    extends beyond us: it rusts iron and ripens corn. Far out on every
    side of us those elements are broadcast, driven in many currents;
    and birth and gesture and death and the springing of violets from
    the grave are but a few out of ten thousand resultant
    combinations. That clear, perpetual outline of face and limb is
    but an image of ours, under which we group them&mdash;a design in a
    web, the actual threads of which pass out beyond it. This at least
    of flamelike our life has, that it is but the concurrence, renewed
    from moment to moment, of forces parting sooner or later on their
    ways.</p>

    <p>Or, if we begin with the inward world of thought and feeling,
    the whirlpool is still more rapid, the flame more eager and
    devouring. There it is no longer the gradual darkening of the eye,
    the gradual fading of color from the wall&mdash;movements from the
    shore-side, where the water flows down indeed, though in apparent
    rest&mdash;but the race of the midstream, a drift of momentary
    acts of sight and passion and thought. At first experience seems
    to bury us under a flood of external objects, pressing upon us
    with a sharp and importunate reality, calling us out of ourselves
    in a thousand forms of action. But when reflection begins to play
    upon those objects they are dissipated under its influence; the
    cohesive force seems suspended like some trick of magic; each
    object is loosed into a group of impressions&mdash;color, odor,
    texture&mdash;in the mind of the observer. And if we continue
    dwell in thought on this world, not of objects in the solidity
    with which language invests them, but of impressions, unstable,
    flickering, inconsistent, which burn and our extinguished with our
    consciousness of them, it contracts still further: the whole scope
    of experience is dwarfed into the narrow chamber of the individual
    mind. Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is
    ringed round each one of us by that thick wall of personality
    through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or
    from us to that to which we can only conjecture to be without.
    Every one of those impressions is the impression of the individual
    in his isolation, each mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own
    dream of a world. Analysis goes a step farther still, and assures
    us that those impressions of the individual to which, for each one
    of us, experience dwindles down, are in perpetual flight; that
    each one of them is limited by time, and that as time is
    infinitely divisible, each one of them is infinitely divisible
    also; all that is actual in it being a single moment, gone while
    we try to apprehend it, of which it may ever be more truly said
    that it ahs ceased to be than it is. To such a tremulous wisp
    constantly reforming itself on the stream, to single sharp
    impression, with a sense in it, a relic more or less fleeting, of
    such moments gone by, what is real in our lives fines itself down.
    It is with this movement, with passage and dissolution of
    impressions, images, sensations, that analysis leaves
    off&mdash;that continual vanishing away, that strange perpetual
    weaving and unweaving of ourselves.</p>

    <p>Philosophiren, says Novalis, ist dephlegmatisiren, vivificiren.
    The service of philosophy, of speculative culture, towards the
    human spirit is to rouse, to startle it to a life of constant and
    eager observation. Every moment some form grows perfect in hand or
    face; some tone on the hills or the sea is choicer than the rest;
    some mood of passion or insight or intellectual excitement is
    irresistibly real and attractive to us&mdash;for that moment only.
    Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end. A
    counted number of impulses only is given us of a variegated,
    dramatic life. How may we see in them all that is to be seen in
    them by the finest senses? How shall we pass most swiftly from
    point to point, and be present always at the focus where the
    greater number of vital forces unite in their purest energy?</p>

    <p>To burn always with this hard gem-like flame, to maintain this
    ecstasy, is success in life. In a sense it might even be said that
    our failure is to form habits: for, after all, habit is relative
    to a stereotyped world, and meantime it is only the roughness of
    the eye that makes any two persons, things, situations, seem
    alike. While all melts at our feet, we may well grasp at any
    exquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge that seems by
    a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment, or any
    stirring of the senses, strange dyes, strange colors, and curious
    odors, or work of the artist's hands, or the face of one's friend.
    Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those
    about us, and in the brilliancy of their gifts some tragic
    dividing of forces on their ways, is, on this short day of frost
    and sun, to sleep before evening. With this sense of the splendor
    of our experience and its awful brevity, gathering all we are in
    one desperate effort to see and touch, we shall hardly have time
    to make theories about things we see and touch. What we have to do
    is to be forever curiously testing new opinions and courting new
    impressions, never acquiescing in a facile orthodoxy of Comte, or
    of Hegel, or of our own. Philosophical theories or ideas, as
    points of view, instruments of criticism, may help us gather up
    what otherwise may pass unregarded by us. "Philosophy is the
    microscope of thought." The theory or idea or system which
    requires of us the sacrifice of any part of this experience, in
    consideration of some interest into which we cannot enter, or some
    abstract theory we have not identified with ourselves, or of what
    is only conventional, has no real claim upon us.</p>

    <p>One of the most beautiful passages of Rousseau is that in the
    sixth book of the Confessions, where he describes the awakening in
    him of the literary sense. An undefinable taint of death had clung
    always about him, and now in early manhood he believed himself
    smitten by mortal disease. He asked himself how he might make as
    much as possible of the interval that remained; and he was not
    biased by anything in his previous life when he decided that it
    must be by intellectual excitement, which he found just then in
    the clear, fresh writings of Voltaire. Well! We are all condamnes
    as Victor Hugo says: we are all under sentence of death but with a
    sort of indefinite reprieve&mdash;les hommes sont tous condamnes a
    mort avec des sursis indefinis: we have an interval, and then our
    place knows us know more. Some spend this interval in
    listlessness, some in high passions, the wisest, at least among
    "the children of this world," in art and song. For our one chance
    lies in expanding that interval, in getting as many pulsations as
    possible into the given time. Great passions may give us this
    sense of life, ecstasy and sorrow of love, the various forms of
    enthusiastic activity, disinterested or otherwise, which come
    naturally to many of us. Only be sure that it is passion, that it
    does yield you this fruit of a quickened, multiplied
    consciousness. Of such wisdom, the poetic passion, the desire for
    beauty, the love of art for its own sake, has most. For art comes
    to you promising frankly to give nothing but the highest quality
    to your moments as they pass, and simply for those moments'
    sake.</p>
