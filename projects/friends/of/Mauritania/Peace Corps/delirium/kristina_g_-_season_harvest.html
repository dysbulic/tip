    <h1>Season Harvest</h1>
    <h3>Kristiana G.</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>For two years now I have lived in Dioullom, a small Pulaar
    village in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, where my status as
    a PCV enables me to participate in almost every aspect of
    community life. The experiences I share with the villagers run the
    gamut from digging sweet potatoes alongside seventy-year-old
    women, to drinking tea with the somber, male village elders; from
    holding lively meetings with the women's co-op, to learning the
    art of rolling couscous with my sisters. My active participation
    in life's daily activities also means I must conform to the
    specific cultural standards of behavior demonstrated by my
    conservative Muslim neighbors. In Dioullom, as in other parts of
    the RIM, this requires upholding what, for me, is an extreme level
    of modesty and prudence. Despite the desert heat, and like the
    other well-dressed and heavily-draped village women, I routinely
    wear ankle-length skirts and shirts with sleeves, or layers of
    loose clothes that do not reveal curve of hip or split of legs,
    and cover every form below the waist&mdash;all to shield ourselves
    from men's roaming eyes. I refrain from appearing too familiar in
    my behavior with male friends, careful to avoid lingering
    handshakes or an arm over the shoulder. I never entertain men at
    my house after dark and sit only with women during meals and
    formal gatherings. By now this conduct is a normal part of my
    life, and for the most part, I am comfortable, though somewhat
    weary, with the limits I must respect here.</p>

    <p>Thankfully though, there are a few rare occasions when I am
    relieved to discover that the rules can be temporarily broken, and
    the usual conservative dictates are discarded. One of these
    treasured events is the yearly ritual of rice planting, signaled
    by the daily exodus of eager workers from the village out to the
    fields. During September in the Fouta, the river region, one finds
    farmers molding piles of mud into dykes and systematically
    flooding each section of their fields, getting ready to
    accommodate the hordes of youth who will descend on the paddies at
    planting time. I leap at the opportunity to participate in this
    venture, knowing it offers the chance to taste a little freedom
    and savor a rare glimpse of the sensual side of my African
    friends.</p>

    <p>On a warm early-September day, the planting routine begins with
    a group of my young friends and me collecting our raggedy
    rice-planting clothes and water jugs or buckets, and gathering
    with others for the long walk to the fields. The air tingles with
    excitement and, as we set out, immediately I sense a refreshing
    openness in the mood of my friends. I walk across the windy
    scrub-land with Ami, Aysata, Kumbice, and Hapsa -- all energetic
    young women, sassy and perky, strutting proudly in bodies that
    have yet to bear the strains of childbirth. We walk in colorful
    pagnes that blow open seductively with each step. Hapsa's long
    naked brown legs seem to go on forever until they come together
    just beyond the overlap of the fabric. I watch their tight round
    buttocks as they walk, steady and proud, keeping an even pace so
    that the drinking water in the buckets on their heads doesn't
    spill a drop. Their laughter and chiding makes me smile with
    appreciation, for this, simplest of pleasures.</p>

    <p>The sun has climbed higher in the sky by the time we reach the
    fields, and we hurriedly navigate the maze of mud-packed dykes to
    my uncle Abdul's plot. As we approach, balancing one behind
    another on the dyke, we are greeted warmly by Abdul and his
    brothers -- muscular, weather-worn black men in tight shirts and
    short pants that reveal the rippling shapeliness of their
    labor-trained bodies. My friends and I then turn to greet the
    young women of the family, up to their bare knees in muddy water,
    holding clumps of rice and leaning on shovels. I see my friend
    Acca -- she's tall and gorgeous, one of those African Beauties
    with full lips and well-formed features, one who could no doubt
    model for Vogue. I'm delighted to see her confidently working in a
    skimpy tank top and skin-tight red velvet shorts exposing her
    knees. Sloshing around in the water beside her the other girls
    work similarly scantily clad. A clamor of whoops and hollers of
    excitement from our other friends fills the air as we quickly
    change into our planting clothes and slip barefoot into the cool
    water. My feet slide deep into the gooey mud, but I love the feel
    of its wet, soft squishiness against my skin, a rare sensation in
    our prickly-hot desert home.</p>

    <p>As the planting gets underway, we all form a line at one end of
    the field, each holding a dripping clump of rice sprouts from the
    pepiniere. Then the singing and chanting begins, slowly at first,
    as we tear off the grass-like strands and plunge them into the mud
    in sync with the rhythm of the voices. We try to outdo one other,
    going faster and faster as the chanting accelerates, getting
    faster and louder with every verse. We bump into each other,
    splashing mud on our faces as we stagger in the brown water,
    groping for more handfuls of rice, trying not to step on each
    others' feet while sliding in the mud. Whooping and splashing and
    gales of laughter overwhelm the chant until we re-form the line,
    and the singing begins again.</p>

    <p>After several rounds of singing and silliness we take a break
    mid-field to pick off the beetles that have taken refuge in the
    dry folds of our clothes. I feel them crawling under my shirt and
    burrowing in the layers of my pagne, which I've hiked up in rolls
    around my waist. My friend Aliou casually picks the bugs from my
    bare back as I hold up my top, while my girlfriends freely tear
    off their shirts to shake out the beetles and let the breeze cool
    their bare skin. Out here in the rice paddies, the rules of
    modesty do not apply; whether we are girls or boys, men or women,
    becomes an insignificant detail in this revelry of physical
    freedom. With bare limbs shiny and wet in the hot sun, we wipe mud
    from one other's faces, pick the beetles from our necks, gripping
    each other for support in the slippery mud. Here the confinements
    of village life give way to the giddiness and camaraderie
    naturally felt in the physical closeness and intensity of our
    work. </p>

    <p>Shouts of Onjarama! Onjarama! reverberate around the field from
    uncle Abdul and his brothers as we near the end of the plot.
    Finished at last, we stretch our cramped backs and lug our
    mud-caked legs onto the dykes, clutching the nearest arm or leg to
    provide a brace against the tugging suction of the slurpy muck.
    Then, grabbing our clean dry clothes, we teeter with muddy feet
    along the slippery dykes and down to the river's edge to clean
    up.</p>

    <p>I am hot and sticky with sweat and have streaks of mud on my
    legs and arms. What a relief it is to strip off my shirt and
    splash into the river's cool flowing water! Thrilled to be naked
    with only my thin pagne floating up around my waist, tangling with
    my belly beads, I giddily splash and dunk my laughing adolescent
    friends out in the deeper water. I think how refreshing it is to
    look around at my young girlfriends unaware of their exposed
    developing bodies, and the boys, seeming not to notice them,
    continue dunking each other, laughing while everyone takes turns
    lathering themselves and one another with soap. Such a rare
    experience this is, reveling in the sensations of wet and clean
    bare bodies in the water, naked clean skin in the open air, and
    skin hugging skin in the hot wind. This time is so precious and
    innocent I don't want it to end! But the sun climbs higher as the
    day lengthens, and our stomachs are growling with hunger after the
    day's physical exertion of work and play.</p>

    <p>One by one, exuberant, but exhausted, and being careful not to
    get our clean feet muddy again, we scramble out of the murky water
    and onto the slippery bank to find our dry clothes. Now that the
    day's work is complete and our excuse for carefree recklessness
    gone, my friends and I suddenly become conscious of our own and
    one another's bared bodies as we mingle together by the river.
    Jolted into an awareness of the rules of modesty once more, the
    teenage boys and girls giggle with embarrassment in the rush to
    grab their clothes, and the boys move further off into the scrubby
    bushes to get dressed. The littlest kids, too young yet to feel
    shame in their nakedness, openly stare at the older girls who,
    with eyes cast downward, awkwardly slip into their clothes while
    hiding under the pagnes draped over their bent backs. Standing at
    the river's edge with the sun baking away the moisture from my
    skin, I take a deep breath and step into my ankle-length skirt and
    short-sleeved top, feeling as though I am cloaking myself in
    modesty once again, resettling into the restrictive patterns of
    village life. With Ami and Hapsa, now properly attired in layers
    of fabric that reduce their bodies' beautiful curves to the
    efforts of my imagination, I clamber up the scrub-covered bank to
    the dirt track at the edge of the fields. The other kids begin to
    wander off in little segregated groups in the direction of the
    village, all carrying their bundles of dirty clothes and chatting
    happily with each other.</p>

    <p>With a sigh, my friends and I set off on the long, blistering
    hot walk back to Dioullom in the afternoon sun. When we arrive, I
    know we will once again sit at a distance from our male friends
    and carefully keep our legs well covered as we eat lunch in
    gender-segregation before drinking our afternoon tea. The
    delightful sensuality of our jubilant foray into the fields and
    river will be a secret memory each of us will keep silently until
    we return.</p>

    <p class="quote">He sought her in the stars, each night wishing to
    pull her down to his heart, in brilliant radiant caress, and fall
    asleep with love's oblivion. But each morning he awoke with the
    stronger knowing that all he will ever wish, and once had, will
    forever pass with night's sad dream. Longing, he realizes, is
    life's only lasting sweetness, made sweeter by its power to elude
    eternity. And all that he will ever strive to hold, he knows, will
    be forgotten in memory of his desire to let go. The expansive soul
    loves, with each moment, the intolerable illusion of infinite
    things, undaunted by the sorrow that temporal loss brings. Thus
    knowing, he sought her in the stars. <span
