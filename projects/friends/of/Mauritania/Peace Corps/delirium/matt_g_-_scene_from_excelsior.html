      <p class="text"><em>(reading)</em> "I dreamt last night of
      the little girl. Now she wasn't walking in the land of the dead;
      She was dead in the Land of the living. And she was covered with
      a cloth, and laying next to her mother. But her mother wasn't
      crying at all. And I came into the room to pay my respects, and
      all I kept wanting to do was to take the cover off the girl and
      see her face. But before I could, they wrapped her in a goat
      skin and the men carried her off to be buried. And I just felt
      awful for not having seen her face. I sat there and no one was
      crying and no one was speaking and she was gone forever. And
      then I woke up and I was thinking about Pater Clare. When I saw
      him last week, he said we did not choose to cut our own throats.
      And now I keep thinking that we are cutting deeper and deeper
      and can't even see the misery that we are inflicting on
      ourselves. It isn't just them. It's us too. " That's it?</p>

      <p class="actor">Elijah</p>
      <p class="text">No, I just thought you had more sense than to
      turn into a dove lover.</p>

    <div class="line">
      <p class="actor">Maya</p>
      <p class="text">I'm not a dove lover. I don't like murder.
      And I think that we have to see our role in our pain.</p>

    <div class="line">
      <p class="actor">Elijah</p>
