        <span class="poem line1">I wake up sometimes standing</span>
        <span class="poem line1">in front of the open fridge</span>
        <span class="poem line1">with a dream</span>
        <span class="poem line1">my moth to the fire</span>
        <span class="poem line1">that turns on just for me</span>
        <span class="poem line1">when I open the door</span>
        <span class="poem line1">I'm not full,</span>
        <span class="poem line1">not hungry</span>
        <span class="poem line1">just a belt notch tighter</span>
        <span class="poem line1">and hammered into the linoleum</span>
        <span class="poem line1">by my toe</span>
        <span class="poem line1">nails.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">I want to run from the light</span>
        <span class="poem line1">cutting through the window</span>
        <span class="poem line1">from long dead stars</span>
        <span class="poem line1">and the slowly blinking night</span>
        <span class="poem line1">eye</span>
        <span class="poem line1">that stares,</span>
        <span class="poem line1">stares down at me like God</span>
        <span class="poem line1">asking questions</span>
        <span class="poem line1">I cannot answer</span>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">Sometimes I rock to sleep</span>
        <span class="poem line1">in the cradle of murmur</span>
        <span class="poem line1">and motion</span>
        <span class="poem line1">from the Japanese brain bomb</span>
        <span class="poem line1">(civilization plays with fire)</span>
        <span class="poem line1">but I wake with a</span>
        <span class="poem line1">start</span>
        <span class="poem line1">to a meaning-</span>
        <span class="poem line1">less quiet</span>
        <span class="poem line1">outside</span>

        <span class="poem line1">dreamsleeping, walksleeping,</span>
        <span class="poem line1">sleepwalking,</span>
        <span class="poem line1">riding and biting the bullet</span>
        <span class="poem line1">with my name on it</span>
        <span class="poem line1">speeding past the dream</span>
        <span class="poem line1">before the mosquito net ripping</span>
        <span class="poem line1">shockwave behind</span>
        <span class="poem line1">catches, breaks and blooms,</span>
        <span class="poem line1">impact before arrival</span>

      <p class="poem">
        <span class="poem line1">Every night I stagger alone</span>
        <span class="poem line1">through crowded dreams</span>
        <span class="poem line1">drunk on the promise</span>
        <span class="poem line1">of a hangover</span>
        <span class="poem line1">(deep, dark sleep)</span>
        <span class="poem line1">and by day my sleepy hand</span>
        <span class="poem line1">picks life and love</span>
        <span class="poem line1">like lint</span>
        <span class="poem line1">from a pocket corner.</span>
