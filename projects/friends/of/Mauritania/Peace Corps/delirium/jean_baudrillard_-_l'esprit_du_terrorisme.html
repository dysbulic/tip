    <h1>L'Esprit du Terrorisme</h1>
    <h3>Jean Baudrillard</h3>
    <hr />
    <p><em>From an essay by Jean Baudrillard that appeared in the November
    2 issue of Le Monde. Baudrillard's most recent book is Impossible
    Exchange. Translated from the French by Donovan Hohn.</em></p>
    
    <p>We have had plenty of global events in recent years, from the
    death of Diana to the World Cup, as well as plenty of violent and
    real events, from wars to genocides. But a symbolic event global
    in reach--an event that is not only broadcast worldwide but that
    threatens globalization itself--had not yet occurred. For the
    length of the stagnant nineties, in the words of Argentine writer
    Macedonio Fernandez, "events were on strike." Well, the strike is
    over. Events are back at work. With the attack on the Word Trade
    Center, we have now witnessed the ultimate event, the mother of
    all events, an event so pure it contains within it all the events
    that never took place.</p>

    <p>The speeches and commentaries made since September 11 betray a
    gigantic post-traumatic abreaction both to the event itself and to
    the fascination that it exerts. The moral condemnation and the
    sacred union against terrorism are directly proportional to the
    prodigious jubilation felt at having seen this global superpower
    destroyed, because it was this insufferable superpower that gave
    rise both to the violence now spreading throughout the world and
    to the terrorist imagination that (without our knowing it) dwells
    within us all.</p>

    <p>That the entire world without exception had dreamed of this
    event, that nobody could help but dream the destruction of so
    powerful a hegemon--this fact is unacceptable to the moral
    conscience of the West, and yet it is a fact nonetheless, a fact
    that resists the emotional violence of all the rhetoric conspiring
    to erase it.</p>

    <p>In the end, it was they who did it but we who wished it. If we
    do not take this fact into account, the event loses all symbolic
    dimension; it becomes a purely arbitrary act, the murderous
    phantasmagoria of a few fanatics that we need only repress. But we
    know well that such is not the case. Without our profound
    complicity the event would not have reverberated so forcefully,
    and in their strategic symbolism the terrorists knew they could
    count on this unconfessable complicity.</p>

    <p>It goes well beyond the hatred that the desolate and the
    exploited--those who ended up on the wrong side of the new world
    order--feel toward the dominant global power. This malicious
    desire resides in the hearts of even those who have shared in the
    spoils. The allergy to absolute order, to absolute power, is
    universal, and the two towers of the World Trade Center were,
    precisely because of their identicality, the perfect incarnation
    of this absolute order.</p>

    <p>Countless disaster films have borne witness to these fantasies,
    and the universal appeal of the images shows just how close the
    fantasies always are to being acted out: the closer the entire
    system gets to perfection or to omnipotence, the stronger the urge
    to destroy it grows.</p>

    <p>When the world has been so thoroughly monopolized, when power
    has been so formidably consolidated by the technocratic machine
    and the dogma of globalization, what means of turning the tables
    remains besides terrorism? In dealing all the cards to itself, the
    system forced the other to change the rules of the game. And the
    new rules are ferocious, because the game is ferocious. Terrorism
    is the act that restores an irreducible singularity to the heart
    of a generalized system of exchange. All those singularities
    (species, individuals, cultures) that have been sacrificed to the
    interests of a global system of commerce avenge themselves by
    turning the tables with terrorism. </p>

    <p>Terror against terror &mdash; this is no longer an ideological
    notion. We have gone well beyond ideology and politics. The energy
    that nourishes terror, no ideology, no cause, not even an Islamic
    one, can explain. The terrorists are not aiming simply to
    transform the world. Like the heretics of previous times, they aim
    to radicalize the world through sacrifice, whereas the system aims
    to convert it into money through force.</p>

    <p>Terrorists, like viruses, are everywhere. There is no longer a
    boundary that can hem terrorism in; it is at the heart of the very
    culture it's fighting with, and the visible fracture (and the
    hatred) that pits the exploited and underdeveloped nations of the
    world against the West masks the dominant system's internal
    fractures. It is as if every means of domination secreted its own
    antidote. Against this almost automatic form of resistance to its
    power, the system can do nothing. Terrorism is the shock wave of
    this silent resistance.</p>

    <p>It is a mistake, then, to characterize this as a clash of
    civilizations or of religions. It goes well beyond Islam and
    America, on which one might be tempted to concentrate in order to
    create the illusion of a confrontation resolvable by force. There
    is a fundamental antagonism at work, but it transcends the phantom
    of America (which is perhaps the epicenter, though not the
    incarnation of globalization) as well as the phantom of Islam
    (which likewise is not the incarnation of terrorism). This is the
    clash of triumphant globalization at war with itself.</p>

    <p>In this sense, it is accurate to speak of this as a world
    war--not the third but the fourth--and the only one that is truly
    global, since what's at stake is globalization itself. The first
    put an end to European supremacy and to the era of colonialism;
    the second put an end to Nazism; and the third to Communism. Each
    one brought us progressively closer to the single world order of
    today, which is now nearing its end, everywhere opposed,
    everywhere grappling with hostile forces. This is a war of fractal
    complexity, waged worldwide against rebellious singularities that,
    in the manner of antibodies, mount a resistance in every cell.
    These confrontations are so imperceptible that it is occasionally
    necessary to resuscitate the idea of war by staging spectacular
    scenes such as those in the Persian Gulf and now in Afghanistan.
    But World War IV happens elsewhere too. It haunts all expressions
    of world order, all forms of hegemonic domination--if Islam were
    dominating the world, terrorism would rise up against Islam. The
    globe itself is resistant to globalization.</p>

    <p>Terrorism is immoral. The occurrence at the World Trade Center,
    this symbolic act of defiance, is immoral, but it was in response
    to globalization, which is itself immoral. We are therefore
    immoral ourselves, so if we hope to understand anything we will
    need to get beyond Good and Evil. The crucial point lies in
    precisely the opposite direction from the Enlightenment philosophy
    of Good and Evil. We naively believe in the progress of Good, that
    its ascendance in all domains (science, technology, democracy,
    human rights) corresponds to the defeat of Evil. No one seems to
    have understood that Good and Evil increase in power at the same
    time and in the same way. The triumph of one does not result in
    the obliteration of the other; to the contrary. We tend to regard
    Evil, metaphysically, as an accidental smudge, but this axiom is
    illusory. Good does not reduce Evil, or vice versa; they are at
    once irreducible, the one and the other, and inextricably linked.
    In the end, Good cannot vanquish Evil except by declining to be
    Good, since, in monopolizing global power, it entails a backfire
    of proportional violence.</p>

    <p>In the traditional universe, there remained a balance of Good
    and Evil, a dialectical relationship that guaranteed, for better
    or worse, the tension and equilibrium of the moral universe. This
    balance was lost as soon as there was a total extrapolation of
    Good--the hegemony of the positive over every form of negativity.
    From that moment, the equilibrium was broken, and Evil returned to
    an invisible autonomy, increasing exponentially.</p>

    <p>Relatively speaking, this is a bit like what happened to the
    political order after Communism disappeared and neoliberal forces
    triumphed worldwide. It was then that a phantom enemy arose,
    percolating throughout the planet, rising up through all the
    cracks in power: Islam. But Islam is merely the crystallized form
    of this antagonism. The antagonism is everywhere, and it is in
    each of us. Hence, terror against terror. But it is asymmetrical
    terror, and it is this asymmetry that leaves the absolute global
    power disarmed. It can do nothing but strike at its own rationale
    for the balance of power, without being able to compete on the
    playing field of symbolic defiance and of death, having deleted
    that playing field from its own culture.</p>

    <p>Until now, this integrating power had succeeded in absorbing
    and reabsorbing every attack, every negativity, and in doing so
    created a thoroughly hopeless situation (not only for the wretched
    of the earth but also for the privileged and well-to-do in their
    radical comfort). But the terrorists have started using their own
    deaths offensively and effectively, based on a strategic
    intuition, a sense of their adversary's immense fragility, of the
    system's quasi-perfection, of the explosion that would erupt at
    the slightest spark. They succeeded in turning their deaths into
    the ultimate weapon against a system devoted to the ideal of zero
    losses. Any system of zero losses is a zero-sum game. And all
    methods of deterrence and destruction can do nothing against an
    enemy who has already turned his death into a counteroffensive
    weapon. Thus the imbalance of more than 3,000 deaths inflicted in
    one fell swoop against a system of zero losses. Here, everything
    depends upon death, not only upon the brutal irruption of death,
    live and in real time, but upon the irruption of a death much more
    than real: a symbolic and sacrificial death--which is to say, the
    absolute, ultimate, unappealable event.</p>
    
    <p>Such is the mind of terrorism.</p>

    <p>Never attack the system in terms of the balance of power. The
    balance of power is an imaginary (revolutionary) construct imposed
    by the system itself, a construct that exists in order to force
    those who attack it to fight on the battlefield of reality, the
    system's own terrain. Instead, move the struggle into the symbolic
    sphere, where defiance, reversion, and one-upmanship are the
    rule--so that the only way to respond to death is with an
    equivalent or even greater death. Defy the system with a gift to
    which it cannot reply except with its own death and its own
    downfall.</p>

    <p>The tactic of the model terrorist is to provoke an excess of
    reality and to make the system collapse under its own weight; the
    terrorist hypothesis is that the system itself will commit suicide
    in response to multiple fatal suicide attacks, because neither the
    system nor power is free from symbolic obligations. In this
    vertiginous cycle of exchanging death, the death of a terrorist is
    an infinitesimal point, but one that provokes an enormous
    aspiration, a gaping void, a gigantic convection. All around this
    minute point, the entire system, the system of reality and power,
    fortifies itself, vaccinates itself, gathers itself together, and
    crumbles into ruin out of its own overefficiency.</p>

    <p>It is, however, a mistake to see the terrorists' actions as
    merely destructive; this is hardly an impersonal elimination of
    the Other. This is about having a personal relationship, the
    relationship of duelists, with the enemy power. It was the enemy
    power that humiliated you, so it's the enemy power that must be
    humiliated. And not simply exterminated. You have to make the
    enemy lose face. And you'll never achieve that through brute
    force, by merely eliminating the Other. The Other must be targeted
    and murdered under extremely dangerous circumstances. Accusations
    to the contrary notwithstanding, the terrorists' act is,
    therefore, the exact opposite of an act of cowardice, as well as
    the exact opposite of what the Americans did in the Gulf War (and
    of what they are doing all over again in Afghanistan): invisible
    target, operational liquidation.</p>
    
    <p>Everything changes as soon as the terrorists begin to combine
    every modern means available with the highly symbolic weapon of
    their own deaths. This combination infinitely multiplies their
    destructive capability, and it is this multiplication of factors
    (which seem to us so irreconcilable) that gives the terrorists
    such superiority. The strategy of zero losses, on the other hand,
    of the clean, high-tech war, entirely misses this transfiguration
    of real power by symbolic power.</p>

    <p>We no longer have a clue what a symbolic calculation is, the
    sort of calculation common in poker or potlatch: minimum stakes,
    maximum results. This is exactly what the terrorists achieved in
    the attack on Manhattan, which provides a good illustration of
    chaos theory: an initial shock provoking unforeseeable
    consequences. Gigantic deployments of Americans, on the other
    hand, achieve nothing but derisory effects--a hurricane, as it
    were, resulting in the flapping of a butterfly's wings.</p>

    <p>Cause, proof, truth, compensation, ends and means--ultimately,
    this all amounts to a typically Western way of thinking. We even
    evaluate death in terms of interest rates, in terms of
    price-quality ratios--a poor man's calculation. We no longer even
    have the courage to pay a good price.</p>

    <p>Among the system's own weapons that they succeeded in turning
    against it, the terrorists exploited the real time of images,
    their instantaneous worldwide distribution. The role of the image
    is highly ambiguous. Even as the image exalts the event, it takes
    it hostage. It multiplies the event into infinity, and at the same
    time it diverts our attention from the event and neutralizes it.
    This is what is always forgotten when we speak of the "danger" of
    the media. The image consumes the event by absorbing it and
    offering it up to the consumer. To be sure, it lends the event an
    unedited impact to a point, but it remains an image-event
    nonetheless.</p>

    <p>What is left, then, of the real event if the imaginary, the
    fictional, the virtual, intrudes everywhere into reality? The
    collapse of the World Trade Center towers is unimaginable, but
    this in and of itself does not make an event real. An increase in
    violence is not enough to open up reality. Because reality is a
    starting point, a first principle, and it's this principle that
    has been lost. Reality and fiction are inextricable, and
    fascination with the attack is above all fascination with the
    image.</p>

    <p>In this case, therefore, reality gives the image an element of
    terror, an extra thrill. Not only is it terrifying, it is also
    real. Or, rather, it is not the violence of reality that comes
    first, giving the image an extra frisson; the image comes first
    and adds a frisson to reality. A kind of fiction-plus, fiction
    that goes beyond fiction. Something like what Ballard (after
    Borges) had in mind when he spoke of reinventing reality as the
    ultimate and most formidable fiction.</p>

    <p>This terrorist violence is thus not a rekindling of the fire of
    reality, or of history. This terrorist violence is not "real" at
    all. It's worse, in a sense: it's symbolic. Violence in and of
    itself can be perfectly banal and inoffensive. Only symbolic
    violence generates singularity. And this singular event, this
    Manhattan disaster film, consummately combines the two elements of
    mass fascination in the twentieth century: the white magic of
    cinema and the black magic of terrorism.</p>

    <p>In the aftermath of the attack we seek to give it whatever
    meaning we can, to make whatever interpretation. But there is no
    meaning, and the radical nature of the spectacle, its brutality,
    is the only thing about it that is original and irreducible. The
    spectacle of terrorism forces upon us the terrorism of the
    spectacle. And against this immoral fascination (even if it
    elicits universal moral condemnation) the political order can do
    nothing. It is our very own theater of cruelty, the only one we
    have left--extraordinary because it represents both the high point
    of the spectacular and the high point of defiance.</p>

    <p>Any killing can be forgiven, so long as it has a meaning, so
    long as it can be interpreted as historical violence--such is the
    moral axiom of good violence. Any violence can be forgiven, as
    long as it is not transmitted by the media. ("Terrorism would be
    nothing without the media") But this is all just an illusion.
    There is no such thing as a good use of the media. The media are
    part of the event, they're part of the terror; in one way or
    another they play along.</p>

    <p>The act or repression follows the same unpredictable spiral as
    the act of terrorism: no one knows where it will end or what
    repercussions will ensue. At the level of images and information,
    it is impossible to distinguish between the spectacular and the
    symbolic, impossible to distinguish between crime and repression.
    And it is this uncontrollable outburst of reversibility that is
    the veritable victory of terrorism, a victory that can be seen in
    the ramifications and subterranean aftershocks of the event--not
    only in the recession (economic, political, psychological) of the
    entire value system, the entire ideology of liberty, the freedom
    of movement, etc., that had been the pride of the West and its
    justification for exerting control over the rest of the world.</p>

    <p>We have reached the point that the idea of liberty, an idea
    relatively recent and new, is already in the process of fading
    from our consciences and our standards of morality, the point that
    neoliberal globalization is in the process of assuming the form of
    its opposite: that of a global police state, of a terror of
    security. Deregulation has ended in maximum security, in a level
    of restriction and constraint equivalent to that found in
    fundamentalist societies.</p>

    <p>A downturn in production, consumption, speculation, growth--all
    indications suggest that the global system is making a strategic
    retreat, a wrenching revision of its values. This retreat is
    apparently in reaction to the impact of terrorism, but in truth it
    is for secrete reasons of its own--regulation born of absolute
    disorder but which it imposes upon itself, internalizing in a
    certain sense its own defeat.</p>

    <p>There is no solution to this extreme situation--certainly not
    war, which offers nothing but déjà vu, the same deluge of military
    force, the same absence of reliable information, the same
    pointless bludgeoning, the same stirring but deceitful speeches,
    the same poisoning. In short, it is the Gulf War all over again, a
    non-event, an event that does not truly take place.</p>

    <p>It is not intended to take place. It has an altogether
    different purpose: to replace a truly formidable event, unique and
    unforeseen, with a pseudo-event that is as repetitive as it is
    familiar. In the terrorist attack the event eclipsed all of our
    interpretive models, whereas in this mindlessly military and
    technological war we see the opposite: the interpretive model
    eclipsing of the event. Witness, thus, the artificial stakes, the
    non-place. War as a continuation of the absence of politics by
    other means.</p>
