    <h1>Sustainable Development:</h1>
    <h2>From Dream to Reality</h2>
    <h2>From the Journal of Environmental Studies</h2>
    <h3>Dr. Emil Salim</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>Since the United Nations Conference on Human Environment in
    Stockholm, Sweden in 1972 until today, the achievements in
    environmental protection have been significant. Many nations have
    integrated environmental values into their development policies.
    Environmental institutions have been created at the national,
    sub-regional, regional, and international levels. Awareness of the
    environment among the general public has risen sharply, and
    knowledge of the environment has grown rapidly. Market-based
    environmental instruments have been made operational, and
    national, sub-regional, regional, as well as international
    conventions, have been instituted. The environment has become a
    household word and a popular topic of numerous conferences. And
    yet, In spite of all this, these achievements have not been able
    to stop the deterioration process that is taking place all over
    the world.</p>

    <p>When in June 1997 the Special Session of the United nations
    General Assembly assessed five years of implementation at the
    World Conference on Environment and Development or Rio+5, the
    harsh conclusion was that the prevailing development pattern was
    still on the "business as usual" track and environmentally
    unsustainable.</p>

    <p>Material consumption and production have followed a similar
    pattern throughout the economy of the world with the accompanying
    negative impacts on social and environmental development.</p>

    <p>In the last fifty years of development, up to 1998, before the
    impact of the economic crisis started to be felt in Asia, the
    world economy has grown more than five-fold, pushed by world trade
    that has grown even faster. While the world economy grew at an
    average of 1.7 percent per annum, the Asia and Pacific region grew
    almost double that Â– an average of over 3 percent.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, in the social sector, total world population
    has increased from 1.6 billion (1950) to 6 billion (1998), of
    which 3.5 billion persons live in the Asia and Pacific region.
    Urban population has doubled in twenty years (1990-2000) to 3.7
    billion persons. By 2015, this may reach 4.4 billion persons,
    which represents 50 percent of the total population in Asia and
    the Pacific. And life expectancy has increased from an average of
    58 years (1975) to 67 years (200) in this region.</p>

    <p>However, most of the people in the region have low incomes and
    low productivity. Unemployment, under-employment, and disguised
    unem-ployment are high. Many of them suffer under-nourishment and
    low calorie intakes, high infant and maternal mortality rates, and
    low education levels. The list can go on, revealing the serious
    degree of poverty, especially in the developing countries of Asia
    and the Pacific.</p>

    <p>Fifty percent of the total Asia and Pacific population, equal
    to 900 million people, lives on one dollar a day. This has been
    successfully reduced to 25 percent in 2000. When the poverty line
    is raised to the level of two dollars a day, however, this number
    will increase to two billion people.</p>

    <p>In this process of development, income inequality has grown
    between the top 20 percent and the bottom 20 percent of the
    population.</p>

    <p>But worst is the impact of economic development on the
    degradation of the environment. Land degradation, freshwater
    scarcity, de-forestation, bio-diversity loss, and air, water, and
    marine environmental pollution are examples of the negative
    impacts of economic development. And by eroding nature's life
    support system, development becomes unsustainable and may well
    come to an abrupt halt.</p>

    <p>What went wrong with this approach and pattern of development,
    and what needs to be improved?</p>

    <p>It is important that at the World Summit on Sustainable
    Development in Johannesburg, South Africa in September 2002,
    serious efforts must be made to review the development process and
    to elaborate further the concept of sustainable development to
    make it more effective and operational.</p>

    <p>Economic development must take into account the environmental
    and social dimensions. Development im-pacts on the environment and
    social aspects must be specifically taken into account through the
    effective im-plementation of environmental and social impact
    analysis, which is further monitored and pursued through
    environmental auditing.</p>

    <p>Social development needs to take into account economic and
    environ-mental dimensions that are then translated into economic
    costs and benefits, and then seriously consider the impacts on the
    environment.</p>

    <p>Environmental development has to take into account its economic
    costs and benefits. Depletion of non-renewable resources must be
    depreciated, as is the case in the depreciation of human-made
    capital. Pollution is considered an externality but must be
    internalized in the cost structure of companies. For example, the
    loss of social value for indigenous populations as a result of
    environmental degradation is not considered by extractive
    industries operating in the jungle.</p>

    <p>If we draw columns depicting economy, society, and environment
    in a box with horizontal lines divided into economic, social and
    environmental development, it is then possible to project the
    impacts of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>economy on social development</li>
      <li>economy on environmental development</li>
      <li>society on economic development</li>
      <li>society on environmental development</li>
      <li>environment on economic development</li>
      <li>environment on social development</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In brief, the interactions between the economy, society, and
    the en-vironment on economic, social, and environmental
    development and vice-versa are traced and properly treated in
    sustainable development.</p>

    <p>From this viewpoint, the need emerges to improve the process of
    sustainable development along the following lines:</p>

    <p>First, to cluster economic, social and environmental aspects of
    develop-ment into one bundle of activities that makes an
    inter-sectoral process of development possible. For example,
    agricultural projects are not treated in isolation from their
    impacts on the social and environmental aspects of development.
    Pollution related to pesticides or fertilizer is not considered
    independent from its social and economic costs. Clustering these
    activities together makes possible the prevention of sector
    dominance of one over the other. But more importantly it enables
    development to take a holistic approach, embracing the ecosystem,
    and social and economic systems in their totality as a coherent
    entity.</p>

    <p>Second, sustainable development takes place at multiple levels,
    such as the national, sub-regional, regional, and international
    levels. Each level has its own unique set of issues that require
    different solutions. There are, however, inter-linkages between
    the various levels that require coordinated and synchro-nized
    approaches. Recognizing these facts, the first Preparatory
    Committee of the World Summit on Sustainable Development Meeting
    in April 2001 decided to start the preparatory process at the
    national level, to move gradually to the sub-regional and regional
    levels, and then to identify major concepts and draw conclusions
    at the international level.</p>

    <p>Third, sustainable development is supported by the economic,
    social, and environmental pillars, which have their respective
    stakeholders. Hence, it is important that sustainable development
    caters to the needs and reveals the interests of the various
    stakeholders. This is the reason why Agenda 21 specifically
    elaborated the various stake holders, consisting of women,
    children and youth, indigenous people, non-governmental
    organizations, local authorities, trade unions, farmers,
    businesspeople, and scientists. Consultations and deliberations in
    the venue of the "multi-stakeholder dialogue" are therefore of
    primary importance.</p>

    <p>Fourth, to make sustainable development operational, it
    requires a concerted effort of economic, social, and environmental
    development that is simultaneously conducted within a
    geographically determined space. In the spatial area, sustainable
    development can take specifically into account the various unique
    characteristics of the economyth, society, and ecosystems that
    exist there. This spatial approach can be applied at the national,
    sub-regional, regional, as wells as international level, making
    sustainable development more workable.</p>

    <p>Fifth, sustainable development requires a "bottom-up approach,"
    based on the principles of (1) inclusiveness-getting all
    stakeholders included in development; (2) partnership among actors
    of development in the private and public sector, as well as civil
    society; (3) transparency-getting the process open for all; (4)
    subsidiarity -- bringing the development decision-making process
    to the level closest to the beneficiaries; and (5) accountability
    by development leaders to the people in the field.</p>

    <p>To make this process of sustainable development feasible and
    operational, it is important to establish a common focus that can
    integrate the outlook and efforts of the participants of
    development.</p>

    <p>An example of employing these integrated factors is focussing
    sustainable development on the plights of the poor, the most
    vulnerable group in society. The poor are not only poor in terms
    of income, but also in terms of nutrition intake, low levels of
    education, low health, high food insecurity, high vulnerability to
    the impacts of disaster, and high unemployment rates.</p>

    <p>They are poor because they lack access to financing due to a
    lack of collateral; lack access to natural resources because they
    have no purchasing power; lack access to education because they
    cannot pay for it; and lack access to political power and
    decision-making processes because they don't have the capacity and
    funds for political campaigning and organizing. In brief, the poor
    are caught in a vicious circle-they remain poor because they
    started off poor.</p>

    <p>The goals of pulling the poor out of the poverty trap,
    eliminating barriers to accessibility that limit progress for the
    poor, and eradicating poverty at its roots can become powerful
    integrating factors for all stakeholders in launching sustainable
    development.</p>

    <p>Market failure is another problem that hampers the proper
    functioning of the economy to absorb and internalize social and
    environmental considerations. The value of forest habitat for
    indigenous populations has a unique social value that has no
    calculable direct-use monetary value. Clean, fresh air provided by
    nature is taken for granted and has no direct-use value. By
    introducing environmental taxes and surcharges, market corrections
    may be introduced.</p>

    <p>However, while these efforts are necessary, they are not
    sufficient. Institutional arrangements are required to cope with
    these market failures; examples include environmental certificates
    or eco-labeling on products that are produced in an eco-friendly
    manner. Financial incentives may not be enough to influence
    consumers toward environmentally sound consumption patterns that
    would stimulate sound production systems. Public pressure may also
    be required to influence either consumer or producer behavior, or
    both.</p>

    <p>A dispute settlement mechanism was established in the World
    Trade Organization to handle cases in which trade disputes cannot
    be resolved by the market or parties involved. Disputes may also
    arise involving the environment in which the market or parties
    concerned fail to resolve problems. Thus, similar treatment
    dispute settlement mechanisms may be needed, involving not only
    trade but investment and production as well.</p>

    <p>It is though such mechanisms that market failures can be dealt
    with. In addition, complementary institutions and arrangements
    need to be established to allow the market to function more
    properly and make sustainable development more sound. The goal of
    overcoming market failures can become useful, integrating the
    efforts of all stakeholders in implementing sustainable
    development.</p>

    <p>Sustainable development must support economic, social, and
    environmental sustainability over the long term. It basically
    means:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>raising productive output while reducing the inputs of
      natural resources and energy, reducing use of land-space, and
      reducing the output of waste and pollution;</li>
      <li>increasing value added by employing human creativity,
      brainpower, and technology using the natural resources
      available;</li>
      <li>continuing the use of renewable resources by staying within
      the limits of their renewal;</li>
      <li>substituting depleted non-renewable resources with renewable
      resources, including human creativity to allow continual growth;
      and</li>
      <li>developing closed loops, in which the waste from one entity
      of production becomes the input for another entity of
      production, in order to eliminate or reduce the amount of waste
      released into nature.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In essence, the integrating factor that unites stakeholders Is
    the desire to implement sustainable development, comprised of
    sustainable production and consumption, which takes into account
    nature's caring capacity.</p>

    <p>Within this framework of sustainable development there emerges
    the need to develop relevant technologies, such as biotechnology,
    material technology, and information-communication technology.
    These technologies are needed to raise the added values of natural
    resources, reduce the amount of material use, and reform methods
    and means of communication, transportation and information
    transfer with increased efficiency, less pollution, and more
    energy savings. In this context, it is crucial that developed and
    developing countries work together to overcome the technology gap
    and the "digital divide among the nations of the globe" ****</p>

    <p>Development is carried out mainly by business, regulated by the
    government, and conducted within a network of civil society. It is
    important to consider development as the combined efforts
    involving the three pillars of government, business, and civil
    society. Each pillar has its role and common but differentiated
    re-sponsiblities, and each pillar has its own interests. Separate
    and differentiated interests can therefore drive development and
    give rise to the need for establishing consultation and dialogue
    between the government, business, and civil society.</p>

    <p>Hence, sustainable development requires a form of governance
    that makes possible the emergence of checks and balances between
    the three major actors of development within a democratic
    environment and within the rule of law. As such, sustainable
    development cannot be conducted from "the top" down, looking only
    from the government's perspective. It requires an approach from
    "below," reflecting the interests and aspirations of civil
    society.</p>

    <p>Sustainable development cannot be conducted along a singular
    line of the economy only while completely disregarding other
    dimensions. Sustainable development embraces the dimensions of
    economy, society, and the environment. It has to manage their
    relevant modes of capital -- man-made economic capital, human and
    social capital, an natural as well as ecological capital. It
    requires, therefore, an out look of living on the "interest"
    gained from these forms of capital, while continuously investing
    and enhancing their quantity and quality.</p>

    <p>It is with this paradigm that through global action we can make
    positive changes to bring sustainable development from a dream to
    reality, in order to build the wold anew in this millennium.</p>
