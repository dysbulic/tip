    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">Tides of apricot sand</span>
      <span class="poem line1">push and clench the dunes</span>
      <span class="poem line1">wandering like their beetles</span>
      <span class="poem line1">for a manifest destiny</span>
      <span class="poem line1">perpetually future anterior.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">Far below the breaking sand</span>
      <span class="poem line1">you can hear - listen! &mdash;</span>
      <span class="poem line1">the rust.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">Motes of crude ore</span>
      <span class="poem line1">weeding and bleeding up through the grit</span>
      <span class="poem line1">each smithied by a camel-headed minotaur</span>
      <span class="poem line1">on a flint hammered forge near Zou√©rate.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">Only the rebar grows at night,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">piercing the sky,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">begging for rain,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">to further oxidize that taste of blood</span>
      <span class="poem line1">and flake away in the wind</span>
      <span class="poem line1">no longer held captive by the barnacles</span>
      <span class="poem line1">in the concrete</span>
      <span class="poem line1">still looking for an iron hull.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      <span class="poem line1">You hate it,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">"It's crude and ugly,"</span>
      <span class="poem line1">you say</span>
      <span class="poem line1">as you summon Prometheus to your lamp</span>
      <span class="poem line1">and file off the gleaming flechettes from your feet;</span>
      <span class="poem line1">because you have already begun</span>
      <span class="poem line1">down low near the dessicating sand</span>
      <span class="poem line1">to leather and harden,</span>
      <span class="poem line1">darken in your mold.</span>
