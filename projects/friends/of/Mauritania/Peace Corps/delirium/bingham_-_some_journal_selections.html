    <h4>December 2000</h4>

    <p>I sit here with a smile on my face, my skirt around my waist
    and the wind on my hairy legs. No one in the world knows what I'm
    doing right now; no one, but me and the ants, goats and cows know
    I'm showing my knees to the world!!!</p>

    <h4>January 2001</h4>

    <p>I woke up sad this morning, like being here hasn't quite been
    what I expected it to be. Heather announced yesterday that she
    thinks she is going to be completely ineffective and have NO
    impact here. Then she clarified that to include me and Kerry, too.
    I was pissed, but more shocked that she really did believe that we
    weren't going to do anything. Granted its not what I thought it
    was going to be&hellip;</p>

    <p>Be patient. Flexibility is not so much apathy or easygoingness.
    It's the combination of motivation, determination, openmindedness
    and optimism that can make a volunteer effective in situations
    that at first glance seem the opposite of what we "trained"
    for.</p>

    <h4>October 2001</h4>

    <p>Back in the village again. This time with an attitude
    change&hellip;its always easier to make a change when I know in
    two weeks I'll be back in PC rides in NKTT: people, CASA, dancing,
    drinks, beach.</p>

    <h4>Late October 2001</h4>

    <p>I need an attitude change &mdash; I have these seeds I need to
    sell and knowledge to disseminate, but I can't be bothered. I
    don't want to deal with the annoying people and don't want to do
    half-assed job of teaching what I can. I don't really see the
    point anymore &mdash; okay, that's not true. I see a huge need,
    but from someone more motivated than me and someone they'll listen
    to. I'll be really sad if I don't find even one RIMer who has that
    potential.</p>

    <h4>December 2001</h4>

    <p>One year done! Toothpaste has a smell here. The quiet is
    tangible and I love my host brother more than ever: he can whistle
    now after months of trying. The baby's beautiful. The kids like
    me; I can see how the culture, traditions, attitudes and quirks
    are passed down &hellip;I feel truly like I'm giving up here by
    doing Stage. This is the hardest part, and I'm leaving 7 months
    early to train others to do what I haven't been able to do. How
    can I justify that?</p>

    <h4>January 2002</h4>
    
    <p>It's a warm night, after a cold day. The world is awake again
    &mdash; talking, making tea, visiting. Sidi and Baba found the
    cows today. So they're leaving tomorrow, and came just now to say
    goodbye and I was tongue tied with the concentration of one trying
    not to forget what the
    words-are-to-say-what-I-wanted-to-remember-to-talk-to-Sidi about.
    Tongue tied enough to let the conversation drop and he left with
    me saying: "Thank you, thank you, Sidi!" and feeling the "oh no,
    I'm all alone again" feeling. I want to scream in English who I
    am! What I want! Why I'm here! No one knows me. I hate it, but if
    I don't know myself well enough to predict my own behavior, my own
    reactions and my own decisions, how can I expect someone else
    to?</p>

    <h4>October 2002</h4>

    <p>Heather just left in the taxi with Kareem and Sidi. It was sad
    for a second, but it's so right. It's the end, and we're fine with
    it. It'll be sad to say "the big goodbye" as Heather said, but
    we've let it go &mdash; the guilt and the "I should be doings" so
    that there's no angst. It's all okay now- in the moment at least.
    There will always be the uncomfortable looking back and "If
    I'd&hellip;" or "I wish I'd&hellip;" but for the moment its okay.
    I'm ready to leave Vounthilly. There was a full moon, a Truman
    Show moon, last night and we thought of doing a skit of Sidna and
    the trainers controlling Stage from behind the scenes. We slept
    well, and it seemed long to me. I dreamt about a party, boys and
    big houses, then woke up lonely.</p>

    <h4>November 2002</h4>

    <p>Last goodbye's: Julie's sobbing and I can't feel my heart even
    beating a little faster&hellip;</p>

    <p>Emails from stateside friends: going home to see people I
    haven't thought about who still put me in a box I can't remember.
    The anxiety is finally there, and I'm so fucking excited.</p>

    <h4>January 2003 (RIM)</h4>

    <p>I am glowing to be back here &mdash; my senses are alive, but
    emotions slow to take over as if I'm still afraid of the initial
    frustration + elation cycles that crushed me in the beginning.</p>

    <h4>Late January 2003</h4>

    <p>I'm stressed and I need to chill &mdash; haven't really got
    this NKTT life anywhere near down pat. Things that should be
    stress relievers aren't: email should make me feel better. It
    doesn't. Movie nights &mdash; nope. Reading a good book? Nope.
    This is going to be more of a learning process than I figured
    on&hellip;Caroline said: Altruism is really not something good,
    but something selfish people act out to seem non-selfish. ???</p>

    <h4>October 2003</h4>

    <p>Not much to say. Confusion and clairity about the end. Confused
    direction daily: what's most important right now?
    Responsibilities? Time with friends? Time with RIMers? Nothing
    time? Down time? I don't know and so am drifting moment to moment.
    Clarity: it's time to move on. I need out of this circle, no
    matter how much it's impacted me.</p>

    <h4>December 2003 (home)</h4>

    <p>The emptiness is starting, the hole right under my rib cage
    where all the memories are. I feel it widening like a lung letting
    more people's presence slip out&hellip;I'm not doing so well. I
    don't think I ever realized how really happy I was. Questions
    about my "plans" intimidating, but good: I do need to make some
    $$. I shouldn't romanticize this experience, but I feel sick to my
    stomach at the finality of it. Or maybe its fear &mdash; fear that
    it never gets this amazing again. Fear that I'll never be me
    again. Someday I'll read this and not feel the same, and that
    scares me. What are true sentiments if you know they'll
    change?</p>

    <p>(Church service) I found it bizarre that everything went
    perfectly &mdash; I understood everything &mdash; everyone stood
    at the right time and knew where the songs were in the books
    because the preacher told them the page #. So simple.</p>

    <h4>January 2004</h4>

    <p>I'm feeling sad at the distance growing (healthily) between me
    and RIM. The emotional connection was still there, but its
    breaking now, and I'm definitely moving on. It's depressing.</p>

    <h4>Late January 2004</h4>

    <p>Great laughing conversation with Sherif today. He pushes me in
    a good direction&hellip;remember that I need to think through my
    actions. Take the time to step back, make small goals, little
    plans that help me move forward emotionally, not just
    functionally.</p>
