          <li>Sidi Baba
          <ol>
            <li>Stated he did not have enough money after expenses for himself.</li>
            <li>It is the opinion of the members that he knew before hand how much money he would be making and we should not give him more money. The money spent was sufficient to cover all food costs plus his salary.</li>

        <ol>
          <li>Carla Hunt is creating a database of RPCV contacts and has asked several of us if we would like to be a part of the resource. This brought up the issue of whether we hand-out people's contact information. We decided we would hand it out to members if the person requested had specified that we may hand-out their information. As Carla is not a member of FORIM, we will not offer her the option of tapping into our database.</li>
          <li>These requests require some labor. As, the officers are busy and time is precious, it seems that the effort should be spent on members rather than non-members.</li>
