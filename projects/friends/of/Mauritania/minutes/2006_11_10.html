      </li>
      <li>Recap of current status
      <ol>
        <li>Membership &mdash; approximately 60 members currently, many who have joined since Shelagh sent out the mailing.</li>
        <li>Calendar Sale &mdash; 25 calendars have been sold for a net profit of $80.  Shelagh will be sending these out to people soon.</li>
        <li>Bank of America Account &mdash; Shelagh has been managing this account. Tracy has activated her card, and Racey will soon get her online banking access straightened out.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Future planning
      <ol>
        <li>Website Resurrection &mdash; the website is currently offline, and needs to be fixed, so that we can be ready to manage membership and activity increases once FORIM is affiliated with NPCA again.</li>
        <li>New La Perle Edition
        <ol>
          <li>The Board decided to contact Will Holcomb (wholcomb@gmail.com) in order to get more technical help for both the website and the newsletter.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>NPCA affiliation &mdash; what is necessary to reaffiliate given the new membership rules for 2007. Racey emailed NPCA to ask about affiliation. Given the previous rules, FORIM has the necessary things including:
        <ol>
          <li>an active board,</li>
          <li>a newsletter,</li>
          <li>more than ten members,</li>
          <li>financial summary.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Future of the Presidency &mdash; Tracy is willing to stay on as President, but would prefer to give up her position if someone else is interested.</li>
        <li>Secretary and Treasurer Duties &mdash; Shelagh is doing both secretary and treasurer work at the moment because she is handling incoming membership checks. There was some discussion of Racey taking on more secretarial tasks to share the burden. Being in Boston makes it difficult for her to take first hand control of the checks and accounting.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
