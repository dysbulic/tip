      <li><p><b>7:00-9:00:</b> Meeting</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Board Introductions:</b> All members present introduced themselves and the current board was identified</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>FORIM History and Current Activities:</b> Tracy began by explaining the history of FORIM thus far. It’s beginning in 1996, subsequent demise a few years later, attempted revival by Tracy’s cohort, and current revival by Tracy, Racey and Shelagh. The need now is to get more people interested in organizing and participating.</p>
        <p>The following projects have been undertaken in the last year (roughly):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><b>$200 Amenons Nos Filles A l’Ecole:</b> FORIM has sponsored one girl for this school year (2007-2008).</p>
            <p>Next Steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Decide whether to continue sponsoring girls in the future.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>$300 for an Essay Contest:</b> In March 2007, FORIM donated $300 to Peace Corps Mauritania’s new GEE (Gender Equity and Empowerment) Sector to facilitate an English Essay Contest across Peace Corps’ Girls’ Mentoring Centers. There was, however, miscommunication over how the funds should be used, and they are currently sitting in the Peace Corps safe waiting for FORIM to tell PC Mauritania what we are willing to have the funds used for.</p>
            <p>Next Steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A FORIM representative (board member or member) needs to take this project on and communicate with the GEE APCD, the PCRIM Country Director and any Third Year PCVs who are in charge of GEE to determine how the funds can be most useful. FORIM’s board should also be included in this conversation as they will have the final say on how funds are used.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Sinthiane Diarra Water Pump:</b> FORIM is acting as the host for RPCV Sarah Shannabruch (2004-2005) to solicit funds for a Water Pump project in her former village. People can donate online and receive a tax deductible donation for doing so. Only 1 person has donated by check ($10?).</p>
            <p>Next Steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Find out from Sarah if she is still soliciting funds. Decide whether we want to act as a conduit for funds like this in the future.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Calendars:</b> FORIM offers new members the option of buying an RPCV calendar when they sign up for membership. Six (6) people have ordered calendars online; 5 paid online, 1 sent a check.</p>
            <p>Next Steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Organize calendar purchase, sale and shipping through RPCV’s Wisconsin in November. Possibly do a larger calendar drive: we can buy calendars in bulk for $8 and sell them for $10.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Re ANFE project:</b> Amacire expressed concern that FORIM should be doing projects that have a larger impact on more people such as wells, not essay contests. This led to a discussion of the history of the project and the strategic goals of FORIM.</p>
            <p><i>History/Rational for this project (Tracy and Kyung):</i> When this project was taken on there was a demand from TEFL PCVs to get support from FORIM for English learning. There were also PCVs in Nouakchott who could facilitate the contest. If there is no more demand for this type of project than FORIM should re-evaluate this initiative.</p>
            <p><i>Strategic Goals:</i> Tracy presented two options, either we act as a conduit for PCVs, RPCV and possibly Mauritanians trying to raise money, or we do more to raise money that we can then use for our own development projects. She is more interested in putting emphasis on getting good at facilitating fundraising and then possibly moving into fundraising for our own projects.</p>
            <p>Shelagh, however, was concerned that paying members would wonder what was being done with their membership dues. Kyung expressed the opinion that most people probably want three things out of FORIM: updates on people’s where abouts, tid bits of information about Mauritania, and a feeling of connection to RIM. Tracy concurred.</p>
            <p>It was mentioned that we have been waiting for more than four dedicated people to go through the exercise of strategic goals in order. It is difficult to imagine deciding on strategic goals for the organization with some few people participating. However, Robyn brought up the point that we need to start somewhere.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Re Sinthiane Diarra Project:</b> Tracy encouraged the group to think about being a conduit for funds such as this (and Peace Corps Partnership Projects). She can put Sarah Shannabruch in touch with some people from her group, including the volunteer who got the first pump, who may be in a position to donate money. Racey will follow up with Sarah.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Membership:</b> As of February 2007 we have 70 paying members. Only a few have joined since then.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Treasurer’s Report:</b> The Bank of America Account has $2241.52 in it. It may be wise to move some of this money to a CD at some point so that it can grow.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Website Update:</b> (from Will) So far as updates, I've mostly just done little things in the last couple months, making requested changes and whatnot. The google payments stuff seems to be working as is the online registration.</p>
        <p>So far as changes, I haven't had time to work out the logistics with Dreamhost, but FORIM will be moving to their own account very soon. That won't really change anything other than making transition to a different developer easier.</p>
        <p>What really needs to be done is to migrate the site into some sort of CMS that allows novice people to work on the site. I'm wrapping up a project with that now and that took almost five months (and cost $4500). The site was more complex than FORIM's, but the workload wasn't all that different.</p>
        <p>I do plan to do the CMS work at some point, but I'm in my first month of grad school right now and currently swamped.</p>
        <p>I have been trying to come up with a way for Rhonda and I to work together productively, but it is a bit of a challenge because we use entirely different toolsets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Future Goals:</b> Not specifically discussed, although development of strategic goals, regular newsletters, and a party/meeting/elections in January were all mentioned at different times.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Elections for Vice President, Treasurer, and Co-Newsletter Editor:</b> Vice President will remain Amacire for now since Mohammed is no longer interested in the position. Treasurer will switch to Robyn temporarily until January elections. Racey explained the minimal responsibilities of the job which include depositing checks, keeping the books (separating out membership dues from donations, calendars, etc). Shelagh has been doing all these jobs, and now Robyn and Shelagh will determine how they split the tasks given that they are both in DC.</p>
        <p>Co-newsletter editors will remain Racey and Rhonda. RPCV Kevin Spicer has some interest in being involved, but Rhonda has yet to be consulted, so she will remain co-newsletter editor for the moment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Other Issues/Members’ Forum:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Next get together will be Tuesday October 2, 2007 at the Big Hunt. This will be a goodbye party for Racey/Hello Robyn the new treasurer and a membership drive. There will be free drinks ($15 max) for all FORIM members. People can sign up to be members at the Big Hunt. This will be underwritten by our fearless leader, Tracy Hart.</li>
          <li>FORIM unanimously decided to sign on to a NPCA Group Leaders letter protesting the elimination of international surface mail because of its impact on overseas book projects. Wording of the Petition is as follows:</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p>To: U.S. Congress</p>
          <p>On May 14, 2007 the USPS eliminated International Surface Mail which was used by many organizations and individuals to support meaningful, humanitarian projects around the world. I ask for your assistance to rectify this situation.</p>
          <p>Many non-profit organizations, faith communities, schools and individuals used this method to ship books, professional journals and other educational materials to nations in need, expanding educational opportunities for thousands of students around the world. Now, the only postal option in reaching these communities is by airmail, which in most casts has tripled and even quadrupled the cost of shipping these vital materials.</p>
          <p>These classroom, book and library projects have an important role in uplifting communities and supporting the education and advancement of young people. At a time when we should be taking advantage of every opportunity to connect with other nations in friendship, goodwill and positive collaboration, I am concerned these recent changes in overseas shipping rates will have damaging &mdash; if not devastating &mdash; impacts on many global service initiatives.</p>
          <p>A “one size fits all” approach for overseas shipping is shortsighted and misguided. It is my hope that you can take action to reverse this recent change so the many good works of many American volunteer organizations can continue.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>Newsletter progress:</b> Racey has software to produce a nice looking newsletter. The newsletter can be distributed through our new google group.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Next Meeting:</b> Tuesday, October 2 FORIM Happy Hour at the Big Hunt.</p></li>
