    <ol>
      <li>Old Business

        </ol>
        </li>

        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>FORIM Calendar
        <ol>
          <li>Status: Muhammed researched cost of quality calendars to be $8 (approx.1,600um). FORIM would have to sell approx. 400 calendars to recover the cost. Currently, FORIM has 180 paid members.</li>
          <li>Member Input:  Too expensive and impractical.</li>
          <li>Action:
          <ol>
            <li>Kyung will continue the cost benefit research.</li>
            <li>Josh will look into bulk sale of calendars by NGOs.</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Suggestion: For the first year, FORIM will produce and sell mid-cost calendars to get a sense for what the demand is for this item.  FORIM will strive to produce a better quality calendar in the following year, according to calendar sales and member comments on this year's sales.</li>
