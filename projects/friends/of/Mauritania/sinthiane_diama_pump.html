    <h1>A New 2-Cylinder Motor Pump to Irrigate the Women's Cooperative Garden in the Village of Sinthiane Diama, Brakna</h1>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>Sinthiane Diama is a small village of approximately 700 people located 90 kilometers outside Boghe, the nearest "city" in the Brakna region. The village is somewhat of a rarity, in that it has only one women's cooperative that is unified, decisive, and very active. It is in the women's co-op garden that all the vegetables consumed by the village and sold at market in Boghe are grown. Needless to say, that makes this roughly 8 hectare (&#305; 20 acres) garden particularly important to the people of Sinthiane Diama; for it not only supplies them with the vegetables that are so important to their health and diet, but it is also a rather large source of income for the village.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, in July of 2005, the motor pump that provides much needed irrigation to the women's garden finally broke down. The previous Peace Corps Volunteer in Sinthiane purchased this motor pump in 1986!  The village did an astounding job of keeping it running for nearly 20 years. This is truly a testament to their resourcefulness and mechanical repair ability. However, like all things mechanical, especially in harsh environments, the motor pump could not continue on indefinitely. So, for the last two years, the women have had to water the 8 hectares by hand!  This is no easy task, as there are no working wells near their garden and it is a long, difficult walk from the river to the garden. I am concerned that they may not have been able to grow enough vegetables to maintain an adequate diet. In Mauritania, malnutrition is something nearly every person has in common. Even a slight increase in the amount of vegetables a person consumes can have a huge impact on their health, and that can make all the difference between life and death when disease strikes, like malaria, tuberculosis and cholera, which are all too prevalent here.</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>

    <p>I would like to raise enough funds to purchase a new 2-cylinder motor pump for the women's cooperative garden of Sinthiane Diama. The village's contribution will be to negotiate the purchase of the motor pump, transport the motor pump from Nouakchott to the village, and then to install the new motor pump on the bank of the river.  I have spoken with my former APCD, or supervisor, Daouda Diallo, who informed me that the cost of a new 2-cyclinder motor pump would be around 1,500,000 ouguiyas. According to the latest currency conversion rates, that would cost roughly $6,000 U.S. dollars; any leftover money would go toward fencing for the women's garden. The fencing currently in place is falling apart and is easily penetrated by sheep and goats, who then feast on what is planted within the garden. New fencing will ensure that the food grown within the garden is for human consumption only.</p>

    <p>I would like to extend my appreciation to everyone for their support of this project. It will make a big difference in the lives of the people of Sinthiane Diama. Further, I would like to thank Friends of RIM, for providing me with a forum to tell people about the needs of Sinthiane Diama, and for giving me a means to do something about meeting some of those needs.</p>

    <p>Gratefully,</p>
