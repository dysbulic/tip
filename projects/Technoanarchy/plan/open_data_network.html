  </blockquote><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Step two is the combination of several different emerging echnologies into a new type of network called Mímis. In computer scientist speak, Mímis is a server-to-server <acronym xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" title="publish/subscribe">pub/sub</acronym> network for the persistent distribution of cryptographically-signed <acronym xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> documents. It's a mouthful, but relatively easy to understand:</p><ol xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">
    <li>Server-To-Server Network — The computers in a peer-to-peer networks organize themselves so that data can be efficiently transfered. Traditional networks like Kazaa or BitTorrent connect home users who tend to come and go fairly frequently. A server-to-server network, however, has less churn because the computers are constantly connected to the internet.</li>
    <li><acronym xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" title="publish/subscribe">Pub/Sub</acronym> Network — The web is a client/server network — people put documents on the network and later people find and read them. In a publish/subscribe network, when someone connects they broadcast the information that interests them and as new information enters the network, it is automatically routed to the subscriber.</li>
    <li>Persistent Distribution — Most <acronym xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" title="publish/subscribe">pub/sub</acronym> research is focused on immediate distribution of data like stock quotes. Persistent distribution means data doesn't go away — data sets aggregate over time.</li>
    <li>Cryptographic Signatures — Signatures let you get a document and know who created it in a way that is resistant to forgery.</li>
    <li><acronym xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> — <acronym xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> is a metalanguage for describing information. It lets me say that a particular electronic document represents a book or a news story or an opinion. Since eventually the network will have a whole lot of information in it, it lets servers succinctly describe their information of interest.</li>
  </ol><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">The point of Mímis makes sure that anyone who wants it can have all of the data. Imagine that a system like this was used for voting. Everyone agrees ahead of time what algorithms is going to be used for computing the results. The Democrats and the Republicans both create open source projects to compute the results separately. Each side can run both programs, which have different people in control. A sneaky geek now needs to infiltrate both organizations. If that seems possible, there could be 15 or 50 organizations all checking each other. Anyone who wants to double check can connect to Mímis, broadcast their iterest and get a copy of all the data.</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Mímis allows the creation of social service markets. For example, <a href="job_markets.html">step five</a> involves using computer systems to optimize the job markets. This system is clearly open to corruption at the level of computer programs. How do you keep a sneaky geek from rigging the results?</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">The system centers on the principle that it is impossible to guarantee against cheating, so the goal is to make it as inconvenient as possible to cheat by hacking. The team of <em xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">übermenschen</em> it would take to infiltrate and hack fifteen different vote computing projects so subtly that no one notices could almost certainly find an easier way to do whatever they are trying to accomplish with the hack.</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><em xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">(I'm still working on this step.
