  </a><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Perhaps you're über-industrious and go to 50 interviews, what percentage of all the jobs you could do did you examine? You could potentially be anything from a beet farmer in Peru to a river rafting guide in the Grand Canyon.</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Stage five's technology is a combination expert/recommender system for jobs. Employers list their needs in a database of available employment opportunities, and anyone can get a list of jobs they'll probably like from all over the planet. Employers get the best candidates in the world and employees get choice. Think of Amazon's suggestions, but for how you make your money. Job search could look like:</p><a href="job_search_2.0_paths.svgz">

  </a><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">The system has two major audiences. One is people hunting for jobs. As people do their jobs, they report on how much they like it and employers report on how satisfied they are. Computer programs search through the resultant mass of data for patterns in why people like their jobs. Job satisfaction becomes a scientific problem quantifiable in terms of self-reported metrics.</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">I can get a list of jobs I will probably like from anywhere in the world. If I don't like the recommendations I get, I can tell the computer why I don't like my options and it can try again. Addressing my frustrations with the recommendations is potentially a valid avenue of research in computer science.</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Unlike Communism where they gave science control of how people would be productive, this is giving science control of providing the options for how to be productive. That's why this step five can be described as total self-employment. If finding work is easy, people don't have to do work they don't enjoy. (Step five relies on <a href="pool_capital.html">step four</a> for plentiful venture capital so creating new businesses is easy.)</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">The other audience is people who want to do something new. Lets say I would like to be an Amazon tour guide for a season. What do I need to know in order to do that? The computer system can tell me why I am not matching. If I need skills, I can develop them. If it is experience, I can acquire it. I can plan for my dream job and, because there is likely a high correlation between dediacted pursuit of a profession and satisfaction with that profession, the actual act of working should increase my chances.</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">This also allows a revision of the academic system. Jobs are described in terms of specific skill requirements. Universities can provide skills piecemeal or the attentations don't have to come from Universities at all. Experts could provide assessments of people who learn a subject on their own. The quality of an assessment will hold, or not, after the fact when the employer reviews the person's skills. Realistic reviewers will build a name for themselves and ineffective ones will fade away.</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Economically, increasing choice will hopefully place a downward pressure on salaries for interesting jobs and an upward pressure on unpleasant ones. How much will it pay to lead tours in the Amazon? Probably not very much, there are lots of people who can do it comparably well and would like the opportunity. How much does it pay to have your toilets cleaned in a world where no one is afraid of starving?</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Later parts of the revolution will focus on making most people very happy making $25k a year. The goal is to create a system where people all make about the same amount, but people who do less pleasant jobs work less. Total self-employment is, in large part, about changing how valuable people consider their time by making choice plentiful.</p><p xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">First, however, we need to <a href="pool_excess_capital.html">take all the money back</a>.</p></div><div id="footer"><ol><li xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="pool_excess_capital" class="previous"><a href="pool_excess_capital.html"><span>Step #4: Pool Excess Capital</span></a></li><li xmlns:lxslt="http://xml.apache.org/xslt" xmlns:doc="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" id="universal_net_access" class="next"><a href="universal_net_access.html"><span>Step #6: Universal Net Access</span></a></li></ol></div></body></html>
