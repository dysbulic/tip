    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">"Political power means capacity to regulate national life through national representatives. If national life becomes so perfect as to become self-regulated, representation becomes unnecessary. There is then a state of enlightened anarchy. In such a state everyone is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbor. In the ideal state, therefore, there is no political power because there is no state. But the ideal is never fully realized in life. Hence the classical statement of Thoreau that 'the government is best which governs least.'"</p>

  <p>In Buddhist and Hindu cultures, a traditional greeting in a little bow while saying "namaste." Namaste reougly translates as, "the light in me recognizes and respects the light in you." </p>

  <p>Technoanarchy's goal is to decentralize authority using technology. </p>

  <p>The first order of business is the economic realm. The Technoanarchist Plan To End Poverty is a series of technological advances aimed at retooling resource distribution to maintain the liberty and efficiency of a market system while addressing some of the systemic issues that make poverty such a persistent problem.</p>

  <p>Poverty is cast as a noble humanitarian issue. It isn't. Fixing the problem of poverty is the <em xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">only</em> way to end terrorism. Attempting to fix the problem militarily is just lopping off the hydra's heads. In <cite xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">The Black Swan</cite>, Nassim Taleb covers the issue quite well. Currently we are attempting to figure out all the ways that someone can do something nasty and keep them from doing it.</p>

  <p>So, how many ways are there to kill 10,000 Americans? 10? 50? 5,000? For however many of our liberties we sacrifice to protect against all the ones that we devise, those who wish do harm to America just have to come up with one. Every son, father or sister that we kill in the Middle East increases the potential that some time in the future someone with the will to do us harm will figure out how.</p>

  <p>Responsibility falls to those of us who understand the pointlessness of attempting to argue the avalanche into stopping to find solutions. Humanity is it's own most serious threat to continued survival. The question is whether or not we will manage peace and self-limitation before an unexpected development sets our progress back 500 years.</p>

  <p>The framework of our economy was laid out almost 250 years ago. It has been modified through the course of history, but the core has seen very little change. The invention of the Internet, however, opens possibilities for interactions that Adam Smith could never have dreamed of. Updating the infrastructure of our society means fewer people have to do things they don't enjoy. We have the technology, all that we really need is a group of people dedicated to making the change. This is Technoanarchy.</p>

  <p>The irony of most anarchist revolutions is they involve smashing things and pointing guns at people. True anarchies are focused on maximizing the individual's ability to control their own life. Chaos and disruption are completely antithetical to anarchy. All that frustrated and angry revolutionaries manage to do is create power vacuums to be filled by those willing to do violence to impose order.</p>
  
  <p>The Technoanarchist Revolution is completely voluntary. Capitalism and democracy already have ways to take power. When people can vote for a Technoanarchist politician who gives them a direct vote on every issue that affects them, or support a profit-donation business that lets them control the reinvestments of their money, they will. Smashing systems requires coming up with a force to stand in opposition. We're going to convince the dragon to eat itself.</p>
