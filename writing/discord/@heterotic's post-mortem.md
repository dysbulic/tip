I'm pretty sure MetaGame has had it's first ragequit. The user @heterotic is no longer on the server and the XP from emojis dropped precipitously.

@heterotic was the only user who emojied in the way I think would be most affective. Emojis were applied liberally (literally ~15% of the total) and represented having seen something as much as wanting to reward it.

The crux of the issue has been how MetaGame handles unsavory content. The general impetus is to simply ignore it and assume it will go away. This would be even more evident under a liberal emojiing. As it is a when something is pointedly ignored it just looks like all the other benign content with no emojis.

What set this all off was a post by @NeoPreacher featuring a SquidBilly and an tentacle tattooed butt. It sparked a conflagration of controversy about misogyny and censorship. In the course of the censorship argument, I posted an argument that driving child pornography underground by making it illegal may exacerbate the problem of locating child predators, and that all censorship is a willful disconnect from reality.

Mine was not a balanced presentation of the argument. It was combined with irritated grumbling over how virtue signalling was decimating PornHub's selection.

Fast-forward a week and during the community call there is a kerfuffle concerning the images and what is safe for work (or public places). So, two new NSFW channels, #taboo & #sex, are created. I move the censorship argument to #taboo.

Things are quiet for two weeks. On the community call, the NSFW channels come up. First, @metaverde tears into the community as a whole because there's sexually explicit material in #sex. They are upset that children can bypass Discord's protections. #sex gets removed.

Next, @heterotic goes and skims #taboo. The last post was about how the word "pedophile" engenders a knee-jerk reaction in most people, and those internalizing their locus of control can't be appealed to rationally. She returns and says she wants the channel removed. It is.

I make some unhappy noises at this and @metaverda chimes in to tell me to suck it up and if I really cared about my writing I'd have backed it up.

@heterotic starts talking about removing people from the community. Everything is so oblique though that someone tries to contribute thinking @NeoPreacher is the one on trial.

I never spoke on the call. I dislike not being able to edit. I have a deep seated belief that if I don't carefully manage other's perceptions of me, things can go horribly awry very quickly. Getting fired for posting a Confederate Flag to Slack, getting booted from the Futurist Party Slack for talking about learning yoga from dogs, and getting doxxed by @heterotic all stand as points in reality I believe reinforce my belief.

The call ends and there is some back and forth in the chat with @heterotic repeatedly telling me (& my emojis) to "fuck off". Things quiet down and seem resolved. A few hours later, I posted a piece by DeMello on the futility of telling someone to wake up. @heterotic responded calling for me to be banned. Then she starts digging through my social media and posting it.

She makes it through a bunch of Reddit posts, then found a picture of my house, then into Swarm. I post a piece by Rumi, _Moses and the Shepherd_ about radical expression and judging other's processes. She calls me an asshole. After about five hours of doxx, @METADREAMER comes in to say that @heterotic has been muted for being abusive, and deletes the bulk of what transpired from the server.
