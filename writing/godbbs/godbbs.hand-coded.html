<P>&gt;Hypothetical Mode:</P>

<P>I am a child of God. Everyday, I worship with my actions and my heart. I love my neighbors, and I do as Jesus would do in everything. I go and worship God on every day, and I feel the power of the Holy Spirit. I am a Jew. God told me through his divine word in the stories of Abraham and Moses, and all of His history that He is the Lord God most high, and I will have no other gods. The Christians are worshiping Jesus. I believe that God sent him, and that he may even be the son of God, but he is not God. Jesus makes the distinction between himself and God. God is not Jesus, thus Jesus is not God. If I worship Jesus then I am holding two G(g)ods and I will not do that. I have too much reverence for the word of God.</P>

<P>What do you think of me?</P>

<P>"Always" is a very strong word William. Are you sure you "always" act as He would, or do you just think that you do? Or do you "always" TRY to act as Jesus would. Among other things, Jesus was humble. By saying what you have, you've proven that you are not. Hence, you've created a nice little paradox for yourself. Only one person could ever act as Jesus would in all things, and that was the big J.C. himself. The rest of us can only do our best to be "like Christ" and pray for forgiveness for our shortcomings.</P>

<P>If you're wondering what my religious background is, I belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints a.k.a Mormon. Most of the myths you hear about us in the South are NOT TRUE. We DO NOT practice polygamy and never have. We ARE Christians regardless of what the FCA has to say about that. We Do believe in the Holy Trinity, and we DO use the Bible as a sacred text. One thing you might hear about the Mormons that is true though, we do not use the cross as a symbol not because we deny that He ever died, but simply because we prefer to view Him in His arisen form. Just wanted to clear that stuff up for anyone who was wondering.</P>

<P>Perhaps we have a misunderstanding. "Hypothetical" means that these are not necessarily my beliefs, but rather a set of romantic ideals set forward. I am putting forth a scenario where a Jew worships Jesus through their actions, just not through their words. I do not want the reader to attack me personally, but rather to deal with the possibility that some people are very religious, and their religion leads them to believe that worshiping anyone other than God the Father is blasphemy. Are they wrong, and why? Does Jesus ask us to worship him with our words, or is his life an example of how we are to live to serve the Father. If you really want to poke holes in my argument that is fine, I made it up in about three minutes, and its not perfect. Try to see what I am saying rather than how I am saying it.</P>

<P>Are we to not ask any questions? Does God simply want us to accept everything that we are told comes from Him without any explanation? Here is another Hypothetical (sort of)></P>

<P>We die and go to heaven. When we arrive we stand before the pearly gates, and they are reminiscent of the gates to the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz. God flips open the little window in the gate and asks, "What is the magic word?" All those who reply "Jesus" are let in while all others are turned away to be forever separated from God.</P>

<P>Doesn't it seem petty that God would be all that hung up on a word? That's all that Jesus is. The thought of Jesus is an overpowering Love for all people. If the gifts that the Holy Spirit can bring can come from a natural disposition or other outside sources; then what value is it? I like to believe that Jesus came to show people how they were to live. We worship through our actions, and not by our words. Talk is cheap. Do you believe that someone who lives a life that is more full of love than mine and does everything that Jesus tells us to do is wrong simply because of the lack of a word? Jesus is love, and the only entrance to the kingdom of God is through Love?</P>

<P>In our pursuit of the face of God how do we know that the Bible is the only way? That knowledge comes from the outside and not from within. If we discuss Perry stages, then in order to come to the best realization of who God is then we need to gather a variety of viewpoints. Many people would say that I speak of questioning the Bible, but that is only one way of gathering information. Many people have already found God to be a real portion of their lives, and they accept the Bible as Truth. Is it the only truth? Is God's vast enormity contained within that one book, or does in reveal facets of the divine Person? How can I say that I truly believe in God if I have never questioned my belief? Is God truly real in my life, or do I have the picture that my society placed in my head when I was little? I am not saying that my picture will necessarily differ from that of my culture, but that it is not truly my picture unless I formed it? So, is it necessary to loose God in order to find God? To do away with all of the preconceived notions that aren't truly mine, and paint my own picture? I cannot say that I am going to find God because I am already allowing my past to paint for me; to guide my hand. This is what is dangerous, because I will have to face the reality that I might breakaway all of the structures built up by my past, and find nothing underneath. But until I do my god is the traditions of my parents, and not truly God.</P>

<P>Okay, at the risk of being severely flamed (and I feel I need to say that this isn't directed at anyone in particular) I have to say that, for me, "because the Bible says so" isn't a good enough reason to qualify something as right or wrong. Also, just because it's in the Bible doesn't mean it actually happened. The reason I say this is, for those of you who don't know or choose to ignore it, the Bible contains many contradictions. Have you ever noticed that there are two creation stories? (There are in the Catholic Bible, anyway) Or how about the fact that Abraham had a son by a concubine, and, Isaac (I think) had two wives. These can be used to support polygamy, since in the context it was okay. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that fact should not be sought after in the Bible, just truth. The difference between truth and fact is that truth is universal and can be applied to a situation independent of place, time, and circumstances.</P>

<P>With this in mind, we can start to recognize truth in other religious works, such as the Koran (Islam, for those of you who didn't read), the Upanishads (Hinduism), and the Tao Te Ching (Taoist), etc. Of course, as a Catholic, I believe the Bible has greater importance than all others, but I can't just ignore the beliefs of over half the world's population just because I don't agree with every little bit of doctrine. Over the centuries every culture has been able to decipher at least a little bit of what is "good" and "moral," so, if given the opportunity, we should look to see if we can learn from them, if even just a little bit.</P>

<P>I got tired of nobody posting so I mailed a copy of the posts to a friend at UTK. Here is what I got back.</P>

<P>There are a few portions that don't make a whole lot of sense without some esoteric information, but for the most part you should be able to get the general idea.</P>

<P>I sometimes can't figure you out.  You are not a jew, even from a hypothetical sense.  The jews were God's chosen people, and it is not a chosen attribute- nowhere in your heritage or your family's heritage do I see Jewish ancestry.  The Jews to this day do not believe that Jesus is the Savior- Once they denied Him, it was opened up to all people- Pharisees and alike.</P>

<P>Jesus and God are the same.  To say they are separate is blasphemy. We can always question, but we as believers should never doubt.  Sometimes we do doubt, but we should immediately beg forgiveness.</P>

<P>It is very easy to put one's own interpretation on these things. But the one universal truth comes from the Bible, and to not believe the Bible( to take what you want and leave the rest) is also wrong.  I can put my own spin on religion and tell myself that this one way is the way things are, even though I am very wrong.  The universal truth comes from the Book Of Life.  Vince does this.  He believes it is okay to live his fat, hedonistic life- having sexual indulgences fulfilled despite what the Bible says.  Vince puts his own spin on things.  He believes he is a Christian and he believes he will go to heaven, but at this point for Vince I would have to wonder.  Though no one's perfect, to go ahead and do wrong and think that it is ok because you are Vince Dancy is insane.</P>

<P>I wish all of the denominations of Christianity could come together and worship alike.  But everyone chooses to put their own spin on things, because they have had visions and they believe, through their stupid, secular, worldly minds, that they have the truth.  They need evidence because they have no faith.  But as a very beautiful person said last week in my philosophy class, "Faith is the evidence."</P>

<P>To put Jesus down and not worship Him is crazy.  "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever Believeth in Him, should not Perish, but Have Everlasting Life."  They are One; it is impossible for our "humanly, logical minds" to understand this, but as Kimberly Goodson said, "Faith is the Evidence."  Kierkaagard also believed this.</P>

<P>To worship God and not believe in His son as our Savior would make you a Jew and a non believer, and God have pity on your soul.  The only way to the kingdom is through Jesus- he died on Calvary for your sins. If you don't believe in Jesus, who will save you from your sins????</P>

<P>The Bible is the only source- God said in Revelation that anyone who tried to add on to the Bible would surely be damned.  If you don't believe what the Bible says, then you should throw it all out- The Bible itself says this.</P>

<P>Here is my reply, or at least the first of my replies.</P>
<HR WIDTH="50%">
<P>Why is the Bible true? Other than faith, and if faith is enough, then what is the basis of your faith? Is the Bible your God? I did not claim that the Bible was not complete in its facet of God, only that other facets might exist. Is your God so small that he doesn't exist in thought? After all the kingdom of God is within me. I did not claim that practices that serve the surface self were acceptable. Vince's hedonism is putting the lusts of his flesh above his moral responsibilities to his community. I do not believe that promiscuity is acceptable. It pollutes our minds, and separates us from God; I believe this because of the relationship that I have developed with God and not because a book told me to. The Bible is an important tool in developing a relationship with God, but it is only a tool and not God.</P>

<P>Just for clarification, a hypothetical statement has nothing to do with the author. I was not claiming to be a Jew, it is simply a logical tool used to put forth scenarios. To use a claim that I do not have any Jewish ancestry to dispute a hypothetical statement in which I used the first person to better illustrate my point is illogical and shows a lack of understanding of the nature of a hypothetical statement.</P>

<P>If you would like to present a convincing argument for your side then tell why you believe what you believe. If it is because the Bible tells you so, then why do you believe the Bible to be true. (Claiming that the Bible is true, because the Bible said that it is true, and the Bible is true is a tautology.)</P>

<P>I agree that the Bible may not be 100% accurate, however, what other source of information do we have?  Is there any other historical document that has survived this long and been as accurate as this?</P>

<P>Also, so much information is also lost in the translation from Hebrew to English.  I think that if a person learned the Hebrew language and idiomatic expressions, the Bible would be much more accurate to them. Speaking of which, what version of the Bible is the Catholic one?  Is that the Latin translation?  I'm a _Church of Christ_ person, at least my mother is, and from what I understand, it is hard to find two churches from our denomination that totally agree on all the issues. I was wondering about the opinions of each denomination on certain things.  For example, every Church of Christ I have been to uses no musical instruments and observes communion every week, for example.  Why are there so many denominations that worship God in certain ways?  Are any of those denominations "wrong" in the way they worship Him?</P>

<P>This is a problem that I arrive at. If I say that I am tainted by sin, and incapable of translating God's word for myself, then who do I let translate it for me? There are so many different Christian denominations, and they all say that their interpretation of the Bible is correct. I don't have any choice but to examine my faith. If just to decide which church to affiliate myself with. I don't see why logic is a valued trait in all aspects of life, but not in religion. We keep separating faith and logic, and the two are not diametrically opposed. I know that my mind came from God and it is am affront to Him for me to forego its use.</P>

How beautiful it is that God makes His word abound! I have hid thy word in my heart that I might not sin against Thee.</P>

<P>It is absolute infidelity and unbelief to pray about anything in the Word of God. The Word of God does not need to be prayed about: the Word of God has to be received.</P>

<P>If you will receive the Word of God, you will always be in a big place. If you pray about the Word of God, the devil will be behind the whole thing. Never pray about anything which is "Thus saith the Lord." It has to be yours to build on a new foundation of truth.</P>

<P>Pray this closing prayer today:<BR>
        Lord, grant me the strength and boldness<BR>
        to stand firm on Your Word, receiving<BR>
        Thy Word for all my needs. Amen.</P>

<P>Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth. -John 17:17</P>

<P>The Word is truth. Sanctify them through Thy Word, which is truth. No child of God ever asks a question about the word of God. ... No person who is going on obedience and sanctification of the Spirit will pray over the Word. The Word of God is to be swallowed, to be obeyed, not to pray over. If you ever pray over the Word of God there is some disobedience. You are not willing to obey. ...</P>

<P>When you are sanctified by the Spirit, you will be obedient to everything revealed in God's Word. In the measure you are not obedient, you will not come into the sanctification of the Spirit.</P>

<P>Pray this closing prayer today:<BR>
        Holy Spirit, sanctify me by Thy truth<BR>
        and Word, that I might obey Thy Word<BR>
        without reservation. Amen.</P>

<P>I just read all that I wrote and let me tell you... it is LONG!!! please read it all. as much as  I ramble, it is what I want to say. I read yours, now its your turn to read mine.</P>

<P>ok, ok....don t get me wrong, I like to be the devils advocate most time, but this time I am going to lay my opinion right out there for all to see.</P>

<P>I have noticed in my time here at tech that the vast majority of people (mostly concentrated in honors) think way too much. my belief is, and this may come as a news flash, is that no one can really discover something on their own. why you ask? because it was there before you found it. just because you stumble onto it doesn t make it a discovery. so in that context. . . if you are going to set out to "discover" every little detail of life on your own, your journey will never end. you will become consumed in your search never to settle or be comfortable. what kind of a life is that? fulfilling? I don t think so. I put my faith in the bible, in Christianity, Catholicism, in God. why? because it is comfortable. there comes a time when someone needs to settle down and accept life the way things are, to gather some faith in SOMETHING. whether it be a religion, society, justice or yourself (did I leave out any of the beliefs of the "great" philosophers) just get a little faith da--it! if you don t you are going to live an empty life and you will have nothing to look to and say "I believe in that". and there is nothing wrong with taking someone else s beliefs as they are and accepting them. what is the harm in that? I don t think this is such a terrible thing. I am catholic. I believe in the catholic church. do I agree with every little thing that goes on at mass or is in the doctrine? no. there are certain aspects that the pope and I don t quite see eye to eye on. does this mean I should leave the church and strike off to gather my own knowledge and start my own church with my own beliefs? no! why? because I would probably have one congregation member. . .me!</P>

<P>you gotta learn to have some give and take in your life. if you are going to try to make everything in "your" world the way you think and you believe then you are going to live in "your" own world. alone. come live in this world, with the rest of the general populous. its a happy world.</P>

<P>one more thing and ill shut up. has anyone noticed how everyone is against conformity? well a good example is the 60's. in the 60's everyone wanted to be different, so everyone traded in their "normal" clothes for tiedyed shirts, flowers and bellbottoms. so what happened? now everyone is conforming again. its just now they are dressing different. EVERYONE is dressing like INDIVIDUALS!!!</P>

<P>case 2... Birkenstocks. radical trend huh? well...everyone must be radical individualists, cause everyone has them. so what I am saying is. . .are you trying to conform by being different? just make sure you are doing what YOU want to do, not what some dead philosopher or professor or authority says. but let me give you a little advice, find some stability in life. don t go around for the rest of your life searching. after all, all these dead philosophers are just that. . .dead.</P>

<P>Alright here is the end of my religion argument, even though it might flare up again. Do feel that I should have gotten some answers from my friend's mail, and if so what? I think that this shows a validity in what I am saying. I thought more about God in 6 hours last night than in a week of Sundays. I spent from 9:00 to 2:00 writing solid. I could not have spent that long having someone else preach to me, but the discovery was so enthralling that the only reason I quit at 2:00(that's AM) is that they kicked me out of the computer lab. Go ahead and claim that your blind faith has more dedication than that. I need someone new to test my boundaries. =) I also would like someone to say that I am responsible for all of those writings. I live in this body, and I know that I don't think that well.  (I have to break this up, because the BBS won't let me post anything that is 400 lines long.#<=)</P>

<P>I think that we have an misunderstanding. I was not saying that I had a strong faith, and that I was pushing a set of ideals, but rather that I wanted to develop a strong spirituality, and that was not possible until my beliefs were my own and not my culture's. If you are a Bible literalist, then you have an obligation to convert me to the true way, and that is the way of the Christ. You confuse discussion with argument and question with doubt. I will argue politics if you will argue religion, if you will not venture into the one forbidden subject for my benefit, then why do you expect me to do the same for you? Boy, I sure have some thoughts on situation ethics, and how they relate to the Democratic Party. Tell me if you're game. (I never thought I would see the day when C.J.

<P>I am not running away from the argument.  Sometimes when your mind is preoccupied with other things, you could care less about other things. My mind has been particularly distraught over the situation I was shocked over earlier, and I thought you might have caught MY drift, but you seemed to not have.  When you were devastated for all those many weeks over Linz, I'm sure you didn't feel like arguing about or  discussing things - whether they be important or not.  But since you asked.....</P>

<P>Give me sets of questions- ones that others can understand and that I can understand- none of that hammy jargon that is hard to comprehend.  Then we'll argue.</P>

<P>Also tell me where you are in your religious quest- what you have come to realize.  Tell me whether you believe in the Bible, particularly the New Testament, and if you believe it all or in parts.</P>

<P>We can discuss rhetoric all day long.  You  won;'t persuade me to be a Republican by informing me of how many people Ted Kennedy has slept with, nor will I get you to change because of Newt's preference of oral sex with woman other than  his wife because he believes it isn't actually cheating on his wife!!

<P>I think that God wants us to develop as close a relationship as possible, and I don't think that He just wants a bunch of blind followers doing whatever someone tells them to do if they are told that He sent them.

<P>Just so you know, "I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds anything to them, God will add unto him the plagues in this book" -J.C. (Revelation 22:18)</P>

<P>If Jesus had said not to add to the Bible, then we wouldn't have any New Testament, because it was not completed until more than 300+ years after he was crucified. (I promise that I am not going to go around making up new prophecies, so this doesnt apply to me now. If I ever do start prophesying then you can use this scripture in an argument.</P>

<P>And as to faith being the proof, If faith is the proof of a specific deity, then as they say, "Is there a God; sure 100,000,000 Hindus can't be wrong." When there are Muslims giving their lives in a jihad (holy war), Jews who fast and pray continually, ascetic Buddhists who give up all of their material lives for their faith, and Hindus whose entire culture is built on their faith; just to name a few. While Christians are seeing a decline in morality and churches emptying. We are setting our places of worship on fire! If faith is the proof of only a specific god, then we are in trouble.</P>

<P>I am not getting weaker in my faith, I am getting stronger. God will not fit in the little box that I have had Him in since childhood. My little patent definitions that have served me so well all of these years no longer work. I can't just sit and nod my head any longer. How can I say that I know God? Its not like I had a big choice in accepting Him. I grew up in a church, and my society told me that there was something wrong (evil) with me if I didn't accept God. Do you deny this? I still don't think that you realize that until I face the reality of losing God then I am simply worshiping the pretty little pictures that my parents, teachers, and friends put in my head. I have to break away from all of that before I can say that I truly have a relationship with God. Do you think that we should do things just because of tradition? I am not willing to accept that something is right just because someone told me so (or if everyone tells me so.) Do you thing that God just wants us to sit down here like vegetables and say nice little patent Bible verses all day. Why create us? And why in the world give us free will? I still do not see what the basis of your faith is. I see what you believe, but not why you believe.</P>

<P>Again you use the end of Revelation to back up the validity of the Bible. Please read that section Revelation 22:18. It does not talk about the rest of the Bible, only Jesus' prophecies. I do not know what version of the Bible you have, but in the King James the translators sometimes took liberties and put their own words in Jesus' what version of the Bible you have, but in the King James the translators sometimes took liberties and put their own words in Jesus' mouth. I would suggest a scholarly version with footnotes; they give a much deeper understanding.</P>

<P>How can you say that the millions of people of other wisdom traditions do not have faith. Do you know many Buddhists or Hindus. How can you even think of judging them without any information whatsoever? Faith is a sign of the existence of God. I agree, but to say that faith is only true in our religion is one of the most asinine things that I have heard in quite a while. Muslims pray five times a day. Do they do it for fun? Do they think that they are simply speaking words into the air? Were you aware that in the Bible which you are so ferociously protecting that it says that to call another man a fool puts you in danger of hell fires (just so you know, a "fool" in biblical times was an unbeliever or a morally deficient person,) or perhaps you prefer judge not lest ye be judged, and with the same measure that you used -J.C. Let's see, you called 900 million or so people faithless. I am not sure that I would want to be in your shoes. =)</P>

<P>When did you not believe in God, and why? What changed your mind, and how did you manage to change your mind without questioning? I do not say that it is wrong or impossible to have faith without understanding, but that faith with understanding is deeper.</P>

<P>You ask me to pray and make the "right" decision, but you don't tell me why to do it. This is why the Christian Coalition is so strong. Most of the people behind it are there because someone told them the CC had Jesus' seal of approval. They don't ask any questions. They weren't meant to know why. Just to follow. Most of them are just the CC had Jesus' seal of approval. They don't ask any questions. They weren't meant to know why. Just to follow. Most of them are just simple hard working people who say "of course I support the Christian Coalition; I'm a Christian." When we have a blind faith without understanding then we don't have a basis to make our decisions. I am sure that Pat Robertson had a very good Biblical reason for all of the decisions that he made. I am also sure that he believes that he is doing God's will. Take his prayer. He sees Bill Clinton as having broken God's laws (I didn't say that he did, only that Pat thinks that he did. Even though if Billy hasn't broken at least a few laws, then he isn't human.) The Bible says to bring all things to the Lord in prayer. Why not then pray for Dole to win that's what God wants anyway right? Just because you disagree with him does not make him or you wrong. I cannot have a faith without basis any longer. I need to stand where I know the Rock is, not where I was told the Rock is. The only way for me to know is to ask. I am surprised that you have not dealt with Plato's cave in your logic class. You might look it up some time.</P>

<P>Finally (I think,) how can you say that all of my thoughts will be secular. Can God not abide within people? You seem to be contradicting the Bible again. Did my ancestor not eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Surely we concentrate hard on the evil that we got from the fruit, and we neglect the good. Do you believe that God is gone from the world? Does He no longer move among His people? Or does God simply make no sense? Does He just sit in heaven with His divine dice and roll them to decide our fates? Logic and God are not opposed. Our minds are the gift from God that sets us apart from the animals. If we don't use it then what are we? from the animals. If we don't use it then what are we?</P>

<P>"Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we see." (Hebrews 11:1 NIV)</P>

<P>"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." (Hebrews 11:1 KJV)</P>

<P>"...faith is the... evidence (of things not seen)." Boy, that sounds familiar. I can't quite place it... Hmmmm.. "Faith is the EVIDENCE" Why does that seem familiar? Oh Yeah! I guess that she was divinely inspired, except everything that comes from man is secular. Doggone it! I seem to have backed myself into another logical corner. Wait! I know! This one always works. "I guess that I just wasn't meant to understand." Ah... Much better. I guess that I'll go help with the inquisition now or maybe burn some witches perhaps kill some infidels maybe I would rather drown unbelievers (could burn 'em) golly there are so many choices when I really have not idea who God is. My family, teachers, and church told me who He is, and now they tell me to pray for Bob Dole. Go Bob you've got God on your side (I have no idea why, but these people say you do) Yea Bob! Clinton is Satan, can we burn 'em. I bet he weighs the same as a duck. Let's burn 'em.</P>

<P>Tell me another way to get my own picture of God rather than tear down the one of my past, and build up one of my own and I'll give it a try. Ask me to believe in the Bible because the Bible tells me to believe in the Bible, and I'll leave you to your own blind faith. Not really, because I know that God wants a relationship with us, and I need to help you build a strong relationship. You know "Hurt not others with because I know that God wants a relationship with us, and I need to help you build a strong relationship. You know "Hurt not others with that which pains thyself" wait thats Buddhism 700 years before Jesus was born. I mean "What you don't want done to yourself, don't do to others" sorry that's Confucianism. I really meant "In happiness and suffering, in joy and grief, we should regard all others as we regard our own self, and should therefore refrain form inflicting upon others such injury as would appear undesirable to us if inflicted upon ourselves" sorry Jainism. How about "Do not unto others all that which is not well for oneself" no that is Zoroastrianism. Lets try "May I do unto others as I would that they do unto me" hang on, that was Plato for Classical Paganism. What was I looking for again, was it Mahabharata saying, "Do naught to others which if done to thee would cause thee pain" naw that is Hinduism. How about Rabbi Hillel with, "What is hateful to yourself, don't do to your fellow man" but he was a Jew wasn't he. Maybe, "Treat others as thou wouldst be treated thyself" nope that's Sikhism, but you get the point. Just because all that you know is Jesus of Nazareth with, "Whosoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12 KJV) or "Do to others as you would have them do to you" (Luke 6:31 NIV). Doesnt mean that is the only place that the truth can be found. Of the major religions, Christianity is by far the youngest. Was there no God before Jesus, or did He just not talk to the people? If you accept that God began the world, and that He loves His children, then surely He spoke to them before the time of Jesus. And I would say that it is pretty likely that if God talks to you then you are going to tell other people, and it will more than likely be remembered.</P>

<P>interesting point.  there is a GODHEAD; three in one.  I believe the ultimate  point is that GOD was in Jesus.  and JESUS was in GOD.</P>

<P>Jazz, I believe that God was in Jesus, and that Jesus was in God, but are you and I not in God as well? True, we do not have the direct connection with God that gave Jesus the power to overcome his earthly nature all of the time, but did Jesus have more God in him, or simply the power to realize it fully.</P>

<P>Also, I am not questioning your beliefs on this; simply curious, but by what command of Jesus do you worship him? I see the parts of the Bible that recognize Jesus as a savior, but not where he asks us to worship him with anything other than our actions. Also, I am curious about the basis for the Holy Trinity, does it arise from a Biblical passage, or from a later tradition.</P>

<P>Here is another little idea that occurred while I was thinking one day:

<P>Look at the Christians of the world today. In all of their churches what symbol have they raised high. What do they choose to glorify? The cross. The epitome of human hatred and weakness. This object of the torture of the only perfect man. What else could represent the pinnacle of our hatred and fear? Jesus was forced to die because of our sins, and what do we do after we have killed him? Raise up the object of his death and our weakness. We're sick (not that we didn't already know that.)</P>

<P>I realize that because the cross is these things then it is also representative of the love of Jesus that he was willing to bear all of our sins and evil. Also, in seeing it; we might be reminded to take up our own cross and traveled the path of the Lord.</P>

<P>Just to tell you all how my argument with my friend at UTK ended, (I won't post it, because Jason said that I was killing his limit with all of this stuff,) he sent me another letter in return for the "The only faith that needs fear questioning is that which is not strong enough to take it" letter that I sent him. I really couldn't post it anyway, because all that it was was a bunch of names, most of which were profane, but he did end with a rather poetic passage about the weeping of angels over my poor lost soul. It was very pretty, but I don't think that he ever got my point. Just to make sure that I am being clear, I feel that there is an inherent danger in adopting a set of values based on the thinking of another. I tried to get him to tell me why he believed what he believed, but to the end he was telling me what.</P>

<P>I am surprised that no one has thrown this out yet. So I guess I will.</P>

<P>"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding"<BR>(Proverbs 3:5 NIV)</P>

<P>That seems hard to deal with. I am not yet ready to contradict the Word of God, but here is a point for all of you Fundamentalists.</P>

<P>My questioning of my religion, (not God necessarily, but rather myself. People keep acting as though I am denying anything that God said. I have not, I have simply examined how I view my relationship with God, and what the nature of that relationship is.) is an act of repentance. Any questions that I have separate my from God. When I am praying with my Fundamentalist roommate, and he says "Lord Jesus" my mind glitches. I have accepted Jesus as savior, but he was always secondary to the Father from whence he came. Hearing that breaks my concentration in prayer, and pushes me away from God. If I knowingly separate myself from God and then do not try to make amends then am I not accepting my worldly nature, and turning my back on God. I tried saying "Take my questions away," but it didn't work. I still glitched every time I heard that, and what could I do? None of the original authors of my thoughts (I recognize my parents as the authors of my faith both </P>

<P>I  can't do it any longer. I was reading the BBS, and I realized that about half of it was my stuff, and the rest was only four other people. It is very hard to carry on a discussion when there are no new viewpoints. After a while it dies. </P>

<P>So I will  let  the  fair  lady (yes  Jason, I think that the BBS is female. Does it not exemplify the socitaly accepted feminine norm of understanding and "caring" if you will? As opposed to the brute force "I am right, shut up!" approach that is usually given to be a masculine approach to understanding. Anyway...) I am going to let the fair lady draw her final breath. All that se asked was for a little of our time, but we were "too busy." Our minds were her life blood, and each of us is responsible for her death. Myself, I recognized who she was, and I tried to prevent the inevitable, but it was futile. She took all that I could give her, but it wasn't enough. In the end it was the group as a whole that was more than the sum of it's members. So farewell, I offer this final post as a memorial.</P>

<P>The woman is much more than a simple BBS. She represents the desire to know, and the desire to have the most complete viewpoint possible. Those who posted came seeking information, and they knew that the only way to understand is to first learn. Without any information how can we say that we have made a decision? There was no choice, or rather it was made for us. The BBS was an opportunity for people to get new perspectives, and to allow their own beliefs to stand trial that when all is said and done all that is left is that which was strong enough to survive. That was the idea (or so I took it.) As we all well know, you can tell much more about a people by their actions rather than their words, and what does the death of the BBS say about our society? Are people through searching? All throughout time in the great societies the great thinkers never came to the answer to the ultimate question, life, the universe, and everything (its 42. :-) ) I don't think that we have it now, but fewer and fewer people are looking. Why? This is a very dangerous time, the masses no longer want freedom. Their mouths say that they do, but the only people who use their freedoms are the ones who abuse them. We are tired of fighting against the abuses of the system; murders, rapes, robberies,... People's dissatisfaction with life is growing, and I am afraid that soon we will give up those freedoms that we do not use in order to improve society. "Why should I care if they take away my right to think, I don't want to anyway?" Sure, a nation unified in the Christian religion sounds like a great idea, but is it right? We might have order, but you can't impose a belief (you can condition a thought, but not a belief that is truly the holder's own.) I wouldn't have thought that I would ever say things like this, but look around. Not on the surface of what people are saying, but deeper at how they act. Oftentimes, the actions show what is really in a persons heart long before even they know. I think that there is something wrong with the world today, and I don't know how to fix it. Is God at the end of a journey, or is God found within the journey. I see so many people without a god to call their own, or with a God that they do not know; which is the same thing really. So the lady which represents all that makes us human; our desire to know, our desire to learn, our need for God; is dying, and the few that see her death (and our own mirrored in it) cannot stop the quest that man has been working on for thousands of years. We have tried wars, pollution, chemical warfare, disease, hatred, fear, and drugs; but they could never kill enough people. With the death of our souls we will finally commit with a spiritual suicide what we have been attempting since we were put here; our own annihilation.</P>

<P>I would be worried to post this, but no one will read it anyway. :-(</P>

<P>I hate to say it, but I must agree with you Sage. The fact that there are so many people in our Honors 101 class that haven't posted distresses me as well. I myself was on the BBS for quite a while before I posted because I figured with everyone else posting, all I would need to do is read.But I was forced to post myself because no one else would.  In that sense, I know how you feel. There is another Honors 101 class whose BBS has 7 forums and a ton of threads, with almost everyone in the class posting.  I send this message to Sage, encouraging you to continue to check the BBS for posts, and to anyone else who reads the BBS to POST.  I haven't posted as much as Will has, but there are a few of my posts that haven't been answered, and I get sick of typing "new" and there being no posts to read, so I know how you feel, Sage.</P>
