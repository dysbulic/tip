On the general subject of gifts; everyone might hold off and when this 
laptop, to which I am much endeared, heads off to the great computer lab 
in the sky I'd really like to have a replacement.

For me to write a nice journal and send it off would take probably two 
hours at least in the cyber cafe here. That's not counting any replies or 
trying to read anything incoming, so not having this would really cut down 
on the volume of my communication since I'd likely only be able to get 
access once a week...

Just a though. I really like this little laptop and it will have a nice 
long life inshallah. =) Many many props to Uncle Ted for letting me have 
it.

Something that has been invaluable is a big ziplock bag that Matt gave me 
from a company called spacebag (http://spacebag.com) Literally the thing 
is either in my lap or in that bag. Even when it is charging it is in that 
bag.

The keys are sticking a little, but I think thanks to the bag is it 
nothing interminable.

Something I've not talked about yet that most of the volunteers discuss is
mystery dinners. Last night was the first time that I've gotten one, and I
got it in spades. =) The last meal is usually eaten around 10:00 at night 
and it is already dark. Since there aren't many artificial lights you 
can't actually see what's in the bowl in front of you. I'm not sure, but I 
am pretty sure that last night's meal was tripe (stomach and intestines.) 
Yum. I sort of pushed my bits out of the way and just ate some slimy 
couscous.

Sort of reminded me of fear factor, but in French.

I've not got anything against them eating it, but I've not quite gotten 
over the thought yet. =)

An interesting story one volunteer told was of her being honored in a 
village by being served the head of the goat. She said she wasn't up to 
trying any though she did manage to sit through everyone else having some.

I have discovered something very nice. Among the things that will grow 
in this region is mangoes. When I went to the cyber cafe this morning to 
send off my mail I stopped by the market on my way back and picked up 
three mangoes. They were 200um per kilo ($1 ~= 285um / 1lb ~= 2.2kg) so 
pretty cheap. I gave them to my family and we ate them with lunch.

Today was a big spending day in general. I had two hours at the cyber
(400um), 2kg of mangoes (400um), and two sodas (200um) for a total of
1000um or about a third of my per diem (3500um.) I've not purchased 
anything else really to date though, so it's not a big deal.

Omar is my little brother here and he is about 5 I'd say. I really like 
him since he is a really helpful kid and smiles alot. He is shy, but he 
has come just now to visit me as I type. He keeps pointing to the screen 
and saying what sounds like "trois herure mani" it could well be Hassinya 
since that is what he primarily speaks.

Actually I don't enjoy his presence as much as I usually do since he seems 
to be developing a cold that I decidedly do not want to catch. He was 
sitting in the chair next to me this afternoon and regularly coughing and 
spitting onto the floor next to him.

Anyhow, I think I'll piddle for just a bit and see if I can make a picture 
page so that people can browse the pictures I've been taking more easily.

Love,
Will
