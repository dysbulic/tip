I had a bit of sadness last night as I sat contemplating my French. It is
frustrating to me because Matt is around with me every so often and he has
French extended family and his French is pretty good. It usually not a
problem and it is cool to have someone who can speak, but he came over to
visit with my host family and really hit it off with my host brother in a
way that I haven't because I can't talk to him the way Matt does.

I like Gille because he has been really friendly to me even though I can't 
really talk with him and it is hard to sit by and watch Matt and him chat 
when I can hardly follow the conversation let alone think about trying to 
contribute.

He offered Matt the opportunity to live here once he moves to Nouakchott 
and Matt isn't planning on it. I'd really like it if he would offer the 
same to me because I may take him up on it.

He has been talking about traveling and having been to Senegal and Mali
and different places. I'd really love to travel around while I am here,
but unlike the rest of the IT guys I pretty much only have the money that
I get from the PC. They are all talking about flying to Paris and it only
being $500 some times of the year, but that is still alot of money to me.

If I lived here I'd have a room which is comfortable. I could even splurge 
and buy a little table so I don't have to work sitting one the floor. Also 
importantly I'd have a regular source of food since cooking is done here 
essentially on a camp stove at best and often on charcoal. I'd not have to 
try and cook for myself which would be good since without refrigeration 
I'd need to eat all I cooked.

According to Robert's GPS we are about 3km from the university. We will
supposedly be able to get PC bikes and 2mi is not much at all on a bike. 
There is also the taxi brusse (bush taxi) which is a van that runs back 
and forth and costs 25um. (On the black market the dollar hit 300um, so 
25um ~= $.08.)

It would let me save alot which would be really nice. Nouakchott is an
expensive city especially the quarter tverack zeina which is where the
bureau is now and were many volunteers live. The current stipend is
80,000um and the proposed one for next year is 100,000um. So I'd be
getting between $250 and $300 a month which is not much back home, but
maybe enough here that I could save to travel.

Something I have been wondering about for the end is why everyone flies to 
Paris. It seems like being in Nouadhibou in the north gets you to Morocco 
and then you can get into Spain from Morocco, so why don't people go that 
way. Maybe it is just a time thing since there is currently no road from 
Nouadhibou to Nouakchott and the trip is to drive a bus along the ocean 
and under bad circumstances it can take a week apparently. The Moroccans 
are building a road though and it will supposedly be done by the time I am 
done, so maybe things will be different. I'll be visiting Nouadhibou 
either way. =)

I'm really enjoying alot being here and seeing these things that are so
unlike what I've seen before. I really like the idea of traveling for a
little at the end in Europe. Making it to see the savannas would be
awesome. I wonder how far south you have to go... It is just so
breathtaking to stand someplace and see things that you've only seen on TV
before.

Love,
Will
