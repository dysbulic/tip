I've been thinking alot about language (being surrounded by languages I
don't understand all the time and all.)

I had a very cool experience two nights ago. I was sitting around with my 
family and there were alot of people around. Generally when there are alot 
of people around everyone speaks Hassinya because that is the first (and 
strongest) language of most people in this area. After a while the 
conversation switched to French and I was happy because I could now follow 
what was going on. The reaction was instantaneous and the recognition that 
I was happy to hear French (which was unintelligible a month ago) came 
after and was very heartening.

Last night I went to a birthday party for another stagier, Catherine, and 
I spent about 15 minutes chatting with her host brother about his 
experiences and interests and what not. Nothing remarkable in the 
conversation, but to be able to have it in French with the music making it 
difficult to hear was cool.

I went to a more advanced class for some discussion this morning. One of
the interesting words I learned is concubinage which is what the French
use for cohabitation. The verb cohabiter exists, but it means to room with
as in roommates. The class was cool in general because I was having to 
work to keep up and I like that. We talked about issues beyond what we did 
yesterday and what we like eating. =)

A linguistic study I would be interested in seeing is how the genderedness
of a language correlates to the rigidity of gender roles in a society. For
example I learned that Arabic has eleven personal pronouns (I, you, he,
etc.) because there is one for each gender for each case except the first 
person singular (I).

Nouns are also gendered in Arabic like in French. This is something I am
glad English doesn't have. If I ever have access to a time machine one of
the things on my list to do is go back and find the guy who first decided
that we're going to make a wall masculine, a rock feminine, a tree
masculine, etc... I'm going to find him and shake him real hard until he
sees that is an absolutely stupid idea and changes it.

(Hassinya, if I haven't mentioned, is an Arabic dialect.)

Love,
Will
