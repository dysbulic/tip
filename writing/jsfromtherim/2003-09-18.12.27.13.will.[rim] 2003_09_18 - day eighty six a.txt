Jay, another volunteer has been having an interesting time getting his
water turned on for his apartment. I'll not go into the details since
they will soon be in his blog at http://jaydavidson.com. The long and
the short of it is that today he went and paid an additional 12,000um.

"We don't have any water meters, so you'll have to wait until someone
moves out of their house and we'll take their meter. If you give us
7,000um though we may be able to find one. And of course there's the
5,000um charge for the installation. If you pay up though we are very
prompt and it will be in by noon."

I was talking to a volunteer though and he said that it really is
possible that they don't have any meters. It's also possible that the
people at the electric company haven't been paid for a while. The
thing is that there is an election coming up. Lots of community
development projects that have been waiting for years for funding are
all of a sudden taking off. Teachers and civil servants though are all
of a sudden discovering that there's no money to pay their salaries.
Supposedly some teachers have been two and a half months without pay.

I'm really uncertain about how I feel about it. I see how the system
is failing and how the under the table dealings help people survive.
At the same time I see how the stuff at the fringes is unmoderated and
can easily be abused. It also helps a broken system to continue and I
think as much as anything I dislike it for that reason.

I'm really reluctant though to tell some Mauritanian fellow to go
hungry to support my moral principles.

Food for thought I guess...

Love,
Will
