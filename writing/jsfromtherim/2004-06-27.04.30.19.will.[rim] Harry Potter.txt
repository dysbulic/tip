I laid around the house yesterday reading Harry Potter. Some 270 pages
in about five hours. I consider this an accomplishment. Why? Because
Harry and his friends were all speaking French. =)

Steph sent two books over that she had purchased long ago and had no
use for. I was really glad that she did it since I'd been waiting a
year to read _Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street_. (Which I
finished before I even left Paris.)

I figured Harry Potter would be tougher, being in French and all. What
I think really helped was that the version of the book I had followed
the movie really closely, so I had to understand even less than normal
to follow along. Amazingly though, every so often I'd realize that I'd
just been reading and not thinking at all about it being in French.

I bought a couple comics in France and I know that my reading level is
still definitely pretty low, but it was encouraging nonetheless.

There were a couple of extenuating circumstances that helped. One, my
knee is in bad enough shape I can hardly walk. Two, the only thing
readily edible in my house was instant coffee and I drank about half a
liter of it. So, the usual soporific effects of French were offset a
bit. =)

Love,
Will
