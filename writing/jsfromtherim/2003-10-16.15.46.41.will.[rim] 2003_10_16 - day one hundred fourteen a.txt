When I was a kid we had a little game called Frogger. The goal was to
aid a little frog in crossing the road. As you'd progress farther
there would be new obstacles like bigger cars and having to cross a
creek with alligators.

I've decided to make a new videogame based on my life. It is going to
be called, "Here's Your Bike, Try Not To Die."

Level 1: You start off as a school kid toddling around a peaceable
          suburban town. You enjoy the fresh air and exercise. Your
          goal is to get to school on time.
Level 2: You are mountain biking in Moab, Utah. You enjoy majestic
          vistas while attempting to avoid patches of sand. Biking in
          loose sand liberating you both of nearly all control and
          momentum.
Level 3: You're a bike messenger in New York, you dodge traffic while
          attempting to dispatch your charges to their intended
          recipients.
Level 4: You are a PCV in Mauritania. You attempt to maneuver through
          a city with no discernible traffic laws and wretchedly
          maintained streets. For added excitement most of the streets
          are made of sand and those which aren't are often partially
          covered with sand. Drivers' licenses in your town are
          awarded solely based on the ability to pay a fee and have
          nothing to do with having proven one can safely operate a
          vehicle. This being the most advanced level, there are the
          additional challenges of the temperature generally being in
          excess of 100 degrees and in the likely event that you are
          struck by a car, there are no good medical facilities for a
          few thousand miles. The upshot though is that you are in
          Africa and the time limits established in the previous
          levels are completely removed.

The bike is really cool though. I can make it to my house from the
bureau in 20 minutes and it takes an hour by foot. I also just like
getting my heart rate up a little. Walking is fine enough, but I've
not been getting enough exercise and I know it. I'm going to try
biking some in the mornings and see if I can find some routes that are
off the paved roads, but which have solidly packed sand.

I've definitely been playing it safe. If I get to an intersection that
is too crowded I just get off and walk. I've not broken any bones thus
far in my life and I'm not wanting to start. =)

Love,
Will
