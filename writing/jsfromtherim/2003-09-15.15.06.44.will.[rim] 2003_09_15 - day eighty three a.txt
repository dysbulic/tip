Alot happened over the last few days as we closed up and headed off to
become volunteers. I'll be playing catchup for a bit. This is one of
those.

Out language exams are interview based. I go in and sit down and
someone asks me questions while recording everything on a tape
recorder. My first one I walked in an he asked me "comment
allez-vous?" ("How are you?") I wasn't accustomed to hearing the
plural of the second person (we usually use "ça va?" for the starting
of greeting or if it is this form it would be the singular "comment
vas-tu?") What it sounded like to me was "comment vous appellez-vous?"
("What is your name?") So I answered his question of how I was doing
by telling him my name. =)

This time though I was ready for it. The questions would start out
simple and progressively get more complex. So we started out with
personal info, but at the end I had some interesting ones like
"America is a rich country, why do you still have so many poor
people?" and "what do you think about polygamy?"

The questions of the why of poverty are big for me right now. Being
here and seeing how geography plays into it has shown me alot. At the
same time I don't quite think that geography is destiny here. The
cultural attitudes are important as well. I was arguing with another
stagier who is reading "Guns, Germs and Steel" that the cultural
heterogeneity of Africa was as decisive a factor in its lack of
development as the inhospitable climate and lack of significant
waterways inland.

It's all speculation for me, but I think the Romans overrunning most
of Europe was good for it in some senses. Homogeneity has its
advantages as well as its disadvantages.

I don't remember if I wrote about this or not, but one of the songs
that I explained to my host father was called "Ghetto Life isn't
Easy." It was interesting to be sitting on the ground listening to
this song on a radio that I'm pretty sure was the most valuable item
in the house by several orders of magnitude. It's 100 degrees and I'm
explaining why this fellow is saying his life is so hard.

Really though things are rougher in the inner cities than here. Drugs
and crime other than theft are not something that there is much of in
Kaédi. It is just sort of depressing to look at the problems here and
to look at the problems back home and see how much of it exists solely
through the decisions of people to be destructive. Honestly I don't
think that the world really needs everyone to be actively productive.
It would be enough if the majority could just manage to not be
destructive.

Anyhow, on that depressing note...

Love,
Will
