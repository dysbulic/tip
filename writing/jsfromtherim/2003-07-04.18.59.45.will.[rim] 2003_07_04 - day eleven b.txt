Ok, I have done dinner and tea and everything. I decided to try and be 
sociable, so after a little nap I woke up drenched in sweat and took my 
French dictionary outside to continue looking up useful vocabulary.

They tried talking to me a bit and they know about as much English as I do 
French. Not enough to really discuss anything usefully, but enough to 
interject the occasional translated word. It is handy in speaking.

While I was sitting out there I would make the occasional note about 
things to write about and so I'll run down those...

When I first got out there one of the sons was mixing a powder in water 
and it looked like detergent to me. Then he took a sip of it which I 
thought was particularly odd. I noticed a little while later though a 
chunk of ice floating in it from their fridge. I guess it was lemonade 
or something. I didn't try it since I'm still weak in the water 
consumption department.

On the subject, it turns out that you have a set of flora (bacteria) in 
your intestines that come from the food you eat and the water you drink. 
When you go to a new place you get new flora and that battle will loosen 
your stool perhaps dramatically. Yesterday they gave us a chart with the 
various types of diheria that we might have and told us only to call them 
for blood or mucus.

So, currently we all filter our water and also chlorinate it. Two drops of 
bleach per liter. Just like a swimming pool; yum. =) Current volunteers 
claimed to cut out the bleaching fairly quickly and to be able to take 
non-filtered occasionally without too many adverse effects.

On mores, nudity is cool with kids (as is pooping in the street) and 
breast feeding in the family area is alright too.

On customs, people sort of click, something like calling a horse, to do
the "yeah, uh huh" sort of thing to signify attention while someone else
is speaking.

I got to experience the receiving end of someone speaking louder so that I 
would learn their language. Amazingly it doesn't work like it does with 
English. Instead of the fellow all of a sudden making sense because he was 
shouting he only got louder.

Three glasses of caffenated tea for supper should making sleeping fun.
It was cool to watch it being made though. One of the sons boiled some 
water then made a pot and poured it back and forth between a glass and the 
pot for a few minutes to cool it off.

There is all sorts of music on the radio. N'Sync and Michelle Branch 
played during supper. Last night we had fried chicken for July 4th and we 
were sitting around complaining how hard it was to know how much to get 
when you have to decide at the beginning instead of just being able to 
push your stuff off into other people's part of the bowl when you're done.

Anyhow, no more battery. Going to go sit outside some more. Too damn hot 
in here...

Love,
Will
