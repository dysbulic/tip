I've been thinking for the last few days about silence. I've largely
given up on trying to come up with general conceptualizations of
spiritual maturity. For me though the extent to which I feel like I am
in touch with an inner sense of silence correlates to how well I think
I am faring spiritually.

I'm not quite sure how to put it other than a sense of a part of
myself that is beyond the daily things that happens. If I am stressed
or angry or happy or whatever there is the emotion, but it is not all
of who I am.

It is different from just being analytical and detached though. That
is how I was for a long time (and still am to an extent). That is more
so a act of repressing things as opposed to silence which is more
letting go.

It's hard to put into words...

Back at school we would do workshops on various and sundry things. One
of the most interesting is a three day workshop on a poem called "The
Four Quartets" by T.S. Eliot.

I was walking over to the bureau today and had a chunk of that poem
come into my head...

"At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;
 Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,
 But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,
 Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,
 Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,
 There would be no dance, and there is only the dance."
                       -T.S. Eliot, "The Four Quartets", Burnt Norton II

The bit made mild sense to me the first time I read it. I think though
that it sort of hung around in my brain for a bit and my ideas sort of
used it to grow on. It now seems a very clean and beautiful expression
of the concept, but I wonder how much of that is just its familiarity
to me.

Regardless, the idea has been coming up for me alot. I feel
disconnected from other people at times; as though their perception of
reality doesn't quite line up with my own. I suppose that is true of
most anyone, but I've been thinking on it nonetheless. The recognition
of and need for awareness of the still point is something I am looking
for in others right now. A sense of recognition of both the frailty
and brevity of life.

For myself I need to start meditating again. It is just always so easy
to put it off when I get busy. I'm hoping to get a calendar for
Christmas. It sounds silly, but it makes a big difference when
skipping a day means a day not crossed off on the wall.

Anyhow, it is late and I have class in the morning.

Love,
Will
