So, my experience that changed my perception some of my
surroundings...

During our party, the girl whose TV I broke came with Matt Mills. (She
gets around apparently.) =) She came up to me and told me that the TV
guy wanted two milles (une mille = one thousand) to fix the TV. I had
talked with Habib and he told me that the most that he thought it
could cost would be one mille. He wanted me to call him if she asked
for anything more than that. He actually thought it was pretty
shameful for me to pay anything, but I did feel responsible.

Honestly, I was pretty sad about it. I knew that I hadn't done
anything physical to the TV and so there shouldn't be any equipment
costs to push the price up like that. As I've talked about whenever I
go to the market people are always jacking the prices and the kids
holler "toubab" and "ça va" all the time. I'm just very aware of not
being a real part of the community and I felt like with this girl that
I was making an actual friend and because of who I am rather than
where I'm from.

When she came up and told me 2k, I told her to come by and find me at
my house later and I'd give it to her. I was almost certain that she
was skimming, but the amount was right on the border of being enough
to argue about.

After the party I went home and sat around for a bit feeling kinda
mopey. Mohma asked me why Wahba was looking for me and I told her. She
also seemed to think it was not right of me to give her money and she
told me, "she is looking for money and she doesn't know you are a long
way away from your family and don't have much money. You should give
her rien (nothing)."

I had left my bag over at the lycée and I went off to get it. Honestly
I was hoping that Wahba would show up in my absence and Mohma would
tell her off for me. (It was that whole avoiding my problems thing I
was saying I don't like.)

On my way out of the lycée I ran into Carl who was headed to a little
party Cat was hosting at Habib's house. I decided to go and as we
walked I got to talk some to Carl about how I was feeling and wanting
to make friends and everything. It really helped to get to talk it all
out.

We hung out at Habib's for a while after that and Carl told the story
of his being propositioned by a Mauritanian. He said he met a guy
while walking by the river. They chatted for a bit and eventually the
guy asked him to come over tea. They had the tea and exchanged
numbers. Later on the guy called and they did tea again. During the
tea this time he somehow managed to work "je suis bisexuel" into the
conversation.

Carl told him that he wasn't, but that he had a friend who might be
interested in talking with him. He talked to him a bit about what it
was like being gay in Mauritania. He said that normally he lives in
Nouakchott and there it's not a big problem. In Kaédi he said he
wouldn't go out with blacks because it was too suspicious, but that he
had plenty of white moor boyfriends.

He tried to work the conversation back toward "you know, I was with a
guy before who'd never done it before" and "I have a video that I
watch late at night." Carl started to feel a bit uncomfortable and
left.

So, anyway, I headed home and on the way ran into Wahba. I'd been
thinking both about how I was feeling and how I was dealing with the
confrontation and so I told her "I talked with my professor and he
told me 2k was too much. What is wrong with the TV that it is going to
cost 2k?" I was more forceful that I wanted to be in large part
because I know that my French isn't good enough to argue with someone
(and I honestly don't like arguing with people).

She seemed a little surprised, but she told me that that he needed to
replace the antenna wire. She said that if I didn't want to pay 2000
we could split it. All of this was really good for me. A broken
antenna wire would come close to explaining the problems I was seeing.
And one mille is what I was wanting to pay.

I didn't do anything that should have damaged the wire, but it really
wasn't about the money, it was about being used. I gave her the mille
and we parted ways. She gave me her phone number to call her if I
wanted to go to a wedding that was going on today. I was still not
really feeling good about the whole situation though and I didn't
write it down. I have an email address for her and if I come to a
point where I feel like it I can always drop her a line.

One of the things that this really did for me though was to give me a
new appreciation of both Habib and Mohma because they were willing to
be honest with me and not treat me like a toubab. I really hope that I
can make some friends in Nouakchott.

Love,
Will
