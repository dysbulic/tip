One last intrapersonal bit before I head to bed...

Steph got on AIM with a PCV in Samoa who runs the website:
   http://americanidle.org

He was pessimistic about the future of our relationship and said to
her the general idea that I have had expressed to me here: "two years
is a long time and relationships don't last." I've heard it a few
times expressed with a certainly bordering dogma.

I filed it away as an interesting trend, but didn't pay too much
attention to it. I figured I'll find out about how my relationship
goes as the next two years unfold. It may be true that in general
people have a hard time with it, but I've got enough unusual things in
my life not to expect it to follow form.

True to the general difference in our characters, Steph did not take
the idea with the same nonchalance. =)

Really thought I do think that we have a few things going for us. An
important one is communication. I like to talk, alot, and about most
anything that I think is important. Steph is able to do the same
though she worries more about upsetting me when doing it. =)

Another is simply opportunity, I didn't know anyone I would rather date
while back in the States and I haven't met anyone since I've left. I
honestly run the odds of her breaking up with me higher than she does.
I don't think that I was doing that spectacular of a job and she is
going to have opportunity to meet alot of guys in the next two years.

The stuff that we did with mentor at Tech matters too. Much like PC
(there are lots of PC marriages) it both forms a common set of unique
experiences as well as strengthening certain character traits that
aren't necessarily developed in the average person. (I'd say
independence and initiative for PC and introspection, openness and
autonomy for mentor.)

I've got enough good sense not to say "I'm different from everyone
else, things will be different for me." At the same time I do think
that at the least I am headed into this with my eyes open.

Really the only major problem I see is that elusive 10% I was writing
about missing. I feel the lack of it in my relationship with Steph and
it stands between me and certainty about the long term.

Love,
Will

P.S. I didn't know it, but two stagieres had their rooms broken into
now. All that was taken in both cases is money, but for me the thought
of someone running off with my laptop is really disturbing.

We have trunks that we bought and I have a combination lock, but it is
in my stuff in Nouakchott. I think that once I am there I need to work
to make sure things are secure. Honestly they could have most anything
I have and I wouldn't care other than this laptop. Journaling is
something I am really enjoying as well as being able to work on stuff
from home.

Inshallah it won't be a problem I'll have to deal with.
