When Brett was little, around twelve I think, I charged him with the task
of creating a form of instantaneous transportation. I said that if he 
would do that they I would either to world peace or cheap, clean and 
plentiful power.

I've been reconsidering his assignment and think now that it might be 
better for him to do a better way for people to wipe their asses. I've now 
got pretty extensive experience with the two most common forms and I am 
certain there is room for improvement.

Build a better mousetrap? Fuck that. =)

Love,
Will
