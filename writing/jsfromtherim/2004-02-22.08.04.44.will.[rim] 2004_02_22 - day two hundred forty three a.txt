I am home again from a very enjoyable vacation. I went thinking that I
would watch a couple of games and mostly have fun hanging out with
everyone and seeing Dakar. Unexpectedly one of the most entertaining
aspects was the softball.

I had never thrown a softball in my life save at an ill-fated party to
watch the Tri-Cities Great Rubber Duck Race. Matt and I (mostly I)
were responsible for placing a pop-fly squarely in the center of an
elderly woman's head. She was knocked to the ground and nearly
unconscious. Since then I have an association between softball and
sitting in the car for long periods of time waiting for rubber ducks
to float by. Since I don't particularly enjoy sitting in the car I've
not been quick to play.

So, I answered the question of "do you want to pitch?" facetiously
with: "Sure, I'm great, or at least I assume so never having pitched
before to learn otherwise." My subtlety was lost on the coach however
and I found myself on the mound.

In pitching (or "hurling" as it is called) in slow pitch softball all
you have to do is lob a twelve inch round ball a minimum of six feet
in the air and fifty feet forward into a box marked on the ground
which is probably 2'x4'. Most frequently softball has a strike zone
just like in baseball (between the batter's armpits and knees when it
crosses the plate), but the umpires in WAIST are the players from
other teams, so they do the box to make it simple. Really all the
pitcher is doing is putting the ball out there for the batter to hit
since there is a pretty limited range of ways you can lob a ball.

It is surprisingly hard to get that ball in the box. I ended up
pitching two games and I got pretty good at it. I was up to pitch the
first game of the second day, but I made an unfortunate discovery of
just how bad of shape I was in when I awoke and couldn't bend over. It
was sort of entertaining for a bit because my catcher had a habit of
rolling the ball back out to me. I'd put one hand of my knee and
slowly work my way down to pick it up. After about ten minutes of that
I was thankfully sent out to left field where the balls generally
arrived in the air.

I had a whole lot of fun. We lost five games in a row to be the first
team eliminated, but I still had alot of fun. We took two teams of 25
though (you can only field 10 people at a time) and our other team
took second place in the social league despite an interesting
composition. We had three fans ejected from the championship game and
one runner who managed to get on base despite having to crawl there
since she was no longer sober enough to walk.

The weekend was billed as much drinking and debauchery with a bit of
softball on the side. Though I got into the later much more than the
former it did not fail to please. During stage we would play ultimate
frisbee during our slack times; we were discussing putting the new
recruits on softball and scouting out talent for next year. (Hopefully
we are invited back. The RIM Pirates were literally as rowdy as all
the rest of the teams combined. With fifty members and usually another
dozen or so honorary ones at full strength we were as much a mob as a
softball team.)

Go pirates. Arrg. =)

Love,
Will
