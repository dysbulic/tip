So after much much discussion we decided that instead of cramming six
months into ten days and end on the 30th we would cram three into four
days and put the second semester off until later.

It is cool in that it leaves me free for Christmas and New Years.

So I've been sitting here going over networking 101 (not hard) in
French (giving me a headache). The test though for the beginning is
very theoretical. We are covering alot of conceptual models that I
don't know especially well because they aren't actually used, they are
the basis for things that are actually used.

It mostly just leaves me wanting to take a nap.

Love,
Will
