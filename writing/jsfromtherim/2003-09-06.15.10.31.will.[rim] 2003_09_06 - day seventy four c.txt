On the subject of price gouging. I'm sort of torn on it. On the one
hand it is really irritating that each and every time I go into a
store that I have not been into several times before I will be quoted
a price that is at least 50% above normal.

One time I went to buy some bread (20um anywhere) and the guy actually
said "20, oh wait, I mean 40." I've honestly not been buying much
because my French isn't good enough to argue with people and I don't
like doing it anyway. Other volunteers have reported transactions
where the seller actually involuntarily smiled when quoting a
particularly unreasonable price.

I look forward to being in Nouakchott and making a relationship with
some boutique owner to where I can buy things and not have to
constantly worry that I'm being overcharged. There is at least one
store in Nouakchott where the prices of the items are actually marked
on the item. *gasp*

As tiring as it is I have a hard time holding onto what I know is many
times the disposable income of the average Mauritanian and feeling
justified at being irritated at them trying to get some of it. I guess
that's a big part of why I'm here in the first place, it doesn't feel
fair for me to have when others don't.

I do sort of feel like a tourist. It goes back to what I was talking
about yesterday with the separation. I know that I'm just visiting. I
don't look at the poverty here as my poverty. These are the problems
of Mauritanians, not my problems. I mean, I feel a responsibility to
try and do something about it, but I certainly don't look at the
poverty here like I would if I went back and found Cookeville or
Bristol decimated by a hurricane. These are not my streets, this is
not my home.

I've read the writings of great humanitarians like MLK and Gandhi and
I think that it is well possible that wouldn't have been true for
them. My sense of "my people" and "my home" and "my community" act to
make me an observer here rather than a participant. I wonder what it
is about some people that allows that to change. I wonder if that is
something that will change with time.

Living in Huntsville it began to become a home as various places were
infused with bits of memories. That was for a year and I really had a
hard time integrating into the community. (Mostly because it took me a
while to start finding communities when it proved difficult to find
people with similar interests at work.)

Currently I expect things to go better here. Most of my job here is
cultural exchange and skills transfer, so if I'm not integrating into
my community I should be. =)

The idea of walking around Nouakchott and it feeling like my home is
just odd right now. I really like my picture of what a well integrated
Will would be like. Speaking French, more outgoing, able to hang out
in a big city and not get completely lost. =) Hopefully reality turns
out to be somewhere in the neighborhood of that.

Love,
Will
