Well, my project is all done. =) It feels good to have it finished
with. It was an interesting experience because I could either remember
the French or I could remember the presentation. I struggled through
the first part and then gave up and just started speaking bad French
and only slowing down when they seemed not to understand.

I had a good class though. Lots of PC staff who had descent (decent?)
educations even if this was the first time any of them saw the inside
of a computer before. I did my class in about an hour and we had an
hour left so I explained why RAM is faster than a hard drive.

A hard drive has physical moving parts which are considerably slower
than the electrical impulses used by RAM which move at near the speed
of light.

From that we branched off into all the data being 1's and 0's and I
explained the idea of a "character encoding" where each character has
a unique code of 1's and 0's associated with it. Then we wandered back
to the hard drive and I told them it was just a metal disc like a CD
that had bunches of little sectors that were either magnetized or not
(easier to explain that alternating field directions) =) and that
correlated to 1's and 0's.

From there we went to CD's and that they aren't magnetized, they have
bunches of little spots that reflect a laser or not, but that the end
result was the same.

From there we nearly headed off into the wave particle theory of light
because someone asked why DVD's wouldn't work in a CD player and I
started to tell him that it was because the wavelength on the laser is
too big. I decided against it though and just left it at "the marks
are smaller and the CD laser isn't good enough to read them."

All in all though I was really pleased. We managed to cover some
reasonably complex material and I think that my mnemonics helped them
remember well. I really enjoyed teaching and I really hope that I get
to do some more scientific sorts of stuff in Nouakchott.

I am finding though that all my teaching is very intuitive. I really
like to give my students models that relate back to information that
they already know. It is how I access information and it seems to help
my students.

My host father got a little lesson on "in French we use the sound of
the article that comes in front of the noun to tell if it is singular
or plural (luh/lah vs leh). In English we use the sound that comes at
the end of the word to tell ("s"). Knowing the "why" of "I need to
start pronouncing my singular and plural words differently" has
seemed to help him remember it.

And to end the evening on a good note my mother gave me a fried egg
sandwich for supper. I woke up and violently shat it out at 3:00am,
but it was tasty. =)

I'm in a good enough mood that even a bout of diarrhea can't break my
stride. Well, literally it can, but you get the pictures. =)

Love,
Will
