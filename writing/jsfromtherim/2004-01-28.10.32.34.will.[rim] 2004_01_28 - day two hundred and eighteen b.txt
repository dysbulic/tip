We have been doing the second semester of the Cisco teacher training
this week. By "we" I mean Matt, myself and one other guy. We haven't
actually had any instructors or other students show up yet. It makes
it a little tougher going through the curriculum by ourselves, but for
me the teaching was in French and nigh incomprehensible anyhow.

This weekend is Tabaski. It commemorates when Abraham was supposed to
sacrifice one of his sons and sacrificed a ram instead. There is a
discrepancy between the Jewish and Muslim accounts as to who was up
for sacrifice (Jews saw Isaac and Muslims Ishmael). The basic idea is
the same though.

Tabaski is celebrated with the killing and consumption of lots and
lots of sheep. Also the obligatory visiting different people's houses
and drinking tea and sitting around.

Apparently it also requires sufficient prep time that no one could
come to class this week.

So, we have been hanging out and reading through the course and taking
the exams. We have a couple routers to plug up and play with. Nothing
too complicated, but I think I am learning it well enough to teach it
in a bit.

Still struggling with the purpose of my life and all that jazz. Coming
out of mine and Steph's relationship cut at alot of really fundamental
stuff for me and I am still piecing together the aftermath...

Love,
Will

P.S. Went and picked up some French books yesterday finally. Trying to
get back on the wagon of studying frequently. I've decided that for
Lent I should give up speaking English with those who speak French
better than I do. That should be an interesting experience.

P.P.S. Mark Hitchcock has been in town and I've been hanging out with
him. He is just a nice guy. I'm thinking about trying to visit Morocco
briefly with him before going to France in June. According to most
reports it is wise to get any traveling in before the hot season hits
and makes it interminable.
