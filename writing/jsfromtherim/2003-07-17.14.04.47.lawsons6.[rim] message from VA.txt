Will,
    I just read your latest message and want to apologize for not sending a
letter or package before now. I have been confused as to the nuances of
your situation. I am not sure how the mail service works or if it works.
If you are living with a family, should we send them something...maybe for
the kids. They appear to be making an effort to help you feel welcome and
part of the family. I want to reinforce that since your American family is
sooooo far away. You might make some suggestions in your messages. I
e-mailed Stephanie this morn to get her input but she must be out. I don't
know about the others but I am somewhat in the dark about what is
appropriate to send. I have some funny e-mails but have not sent them
because they are not flattering and may be offensive to some of your hosts.
Maybe Sonja has a list of things that are considered inappropriate. I
thought about card games like Skiop-Bo and Uno.
    I went to the health food store today to get something to help rebuild
your digestive system. I want you to take this and if it works I will keep
you stocked. If it doesn't , I will try to find something that does. Maybe
a holistic approach in addition to the antibiotic will be better than
letting this thing run its course.
    Take care and remember you have a whole bunch of hillbillies here
missing you.
Love,
Auntie Sharon
