On a more personal note. I've been thinking about shame in the last few 
days. As a fairly confident/arrogant person I'm not often ashamed. I 
figure everyone has their problems and all in all I'm doing what I can 
to work one mine so people should accept me. If they can't then, as I am 
apt to say, "fuck 'em."

The kairos foundation people have a set of terms to describe events in a 
persons development work and one of them is "lifeshock." The idea is 
simply (IMHO) an event which doesn't mesh with your conceptual map of 
reality. It causes you to have an unexpected emotional reaction. Paying 
attention to when these happen and trying to figure out what they 
reflect about your understand of reality is a cornerstone in many 
developmental paths.

I've had three in the last few days and I want to recount them in brief...

The first was sitting with Matt in a restaurant eating lunch. He has 
been following both mine and Stephanie's online journals in the last few 
weeks. He told me about an entry that I hadn't read yet which was "I'm 
always intrigued when people sign things 'love,' when you know full well 
they know not a fuck what that word means."

I've had mixed reactions to Steph's blog entries regarding us. Some of 
it I thought was really succinct and poignant. Some of it was based in 
hypothesis about my activities that weren't quite accurate. 
Unfortunately the most interesting ones went away...

This one though, especially hearing it from Matt, got to me though. The 
difference in our emotional lives was a very important theme in our 
relationship to me. The experience is natural and easy for her. It is 
something that I have to work at. It is much easier for me to step back 
from my experiences and analyze them rather than experiencing them. It 
is one of the things that I would like to change the most about myself. 
It is also one of the things that I have found it the hardest to change.

I do think that she is right that I don't know what it means to love 
like she does. I don't think that I have opened myself to the experience 
and I think that I should have the strength of character to do so. (I'm 
just not working hard enough.) I'm getting better at accepting that this 
is how I am. As the blush on my cheeks and averting of my eyes when Matt 
told me what he read revealed, the process is still ongoing.

At the same time I think there are aspects of the unconditionality of 
love that I understand because of my distance from the experience. It is 
very much like marriage. It is a commitment of will as much as it is a 
feeling. When I get married it will be for richer or poorer. I expect to 
have warm happy feelings toward this other person. At the same time I 
expect to have days and maybe weeks or months where things are not easy. 
Just because I don't feel especially warm toward my mate will not make 
us stop being married, nor will it make me not love her. Love is about 
commitments to myself and this other person, not just about how I feel.

I think I get that part of it even if the emotional bit is still in 
process. It does have meaning though when I sign off though.

Love,
Will
