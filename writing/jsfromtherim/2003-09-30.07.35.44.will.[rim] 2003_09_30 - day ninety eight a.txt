I'm sitting the the Cisco Academy Office and the mouse pad in front of 
me is an ad for the academy. It says "Geniuses Click Here." I thought it 
was cute. It reminds me of the score that Marc Valentin got on his 
French test (his father is French). He was certified as being 
"superior." Other people might think privately that they are better than 
other folks, but Marc has a piece of paper verifying it. =)

I have a mixed memento for yesterday evening. I found a little bakery 
while walking from the bureau. It has just opened and it sold little 
piece of cake and eclair-esque sorts of things. (They looked more like a 
thin cookie wrapped halfway around some whipped cream.) I got a little 
piece of cake, a muffin (which turned out to be coconut) and three 
cookies. I took them back to my place and bought a little box of 
camel/cow milk and had a pleasant treat.

En route I saw a store I had seen before and I wandered in. They had 
Pepsi of all things. I'm not a huge fan of Coke or Pepsi, but another 
little piece of home was cool to see. There is supposedly a black 
currant Fanta somewhere in this town that tastes like Dr. Pepper. Maybe 
I'll happen across it today.

There is a social stigma against eating while walking here. Last night I 
discovered at least a pragmatic reason for it as I was sneaking bites of 
my cookies walking home. It really kills the taste of your cookie when 
you walk by a bunch of people in wheelchairs who don't have anything to eat.

On the food subject I had another piece of the cheese I got a little 
while ago for breakfast. I did it with bread and orange marmalade this 
time and it was quite tasty.

Love,
Will
