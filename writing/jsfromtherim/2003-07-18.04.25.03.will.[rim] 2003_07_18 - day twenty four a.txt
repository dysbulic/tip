I am back home from our center days. The training is broken into "phases" 
and at the end of each we gather back at the school for some more 
trainings.

One of our more interesting sessions was an intro and some q&a on Islam. I 
took some notes while in that and this entry is for that stuff... Also I 
have been reading Huston Smith's "The World's Religions" and there is some 
filler from that as well.

We started out with the 5 pillars, which sort of like the "Roman's Road" 
in Christianity defines what is necessary to be a Muslim.

1. The profession of faith: "there is no God, but the God and Muhammad is 
his prophet." Interestingly Islam means literally, "peace through 
submission to God." It was formed against the backdrop of what Smith calls 
"animistic pantheism" with lots of superstition centering around djinn and 
desert spirits. The PC also emphasizes heavy prevalence of tribal warfare 
and the heavy stratification of society, both of which Islam helps 
alleviate.

2. Prayer: Muslims have a much tougher regiment that anyone I know outside 
of a cloistered order. Dawn (6am), mid-day (2:30pm), evening (5pm), dusk 
(7:30pm), night (9pm) every day. Smith has an interesting story where 
Muhammad went up through the seven heavens one night during Ramadan. He 
asked how much people should pray and God told him fifty times a day. He 
was on his way out and ran into Moses; Moses told him people wouldn't do 
it and he went back and got it lowered to 40. This was repeated 5 times 
until it was down to 5 times and at this point he refused to go back and 
at 5 it stays.

The Koran opens with that general "there is no God but God..." That is 
said before each prayer and then followed with some other Koranic verses. 
The length depends on a person's piety.

There are loudspeakers on some of the Mosques and they play prayer calls 
at the appropriate times. People don't have to pray just then if they are 
busy, but they need to try and get them in at some point. Daouda, one of 
the coordinators, said some days he is busy to the point that he doesn't 
get to pray until the night and he does all 5 then.

3. Fasting: during Ramadan, the 9th month of the Arabic calendar (which I 
am pretty sure is lunar), nothing other than words passes the lips between 
sunrise and sunset. This is quite an accomplishment when Ramadan falls in 
June or July. This year it will start sometime in October.

Pregnant women or people traveling far away from home are exempt from 
fasting, but may have to make other compensation.

I think that the practice is a really neat one. A big part of it is to 
remember those who have less and as a sort of atonement for sins. Just 
that these people who have so little are so giving and so aware of those 
with less impresses me.

4. Charity: much like Christianity, Islam has a 10% "zakat" tax on 
earnings. Additionally though there is a 2.5% tax on all holdings. That 
means that everyone who has something gives a fortieth away each year 
regardless of their earnings. 

Slavery exists in Mauritanian, though I haven't heard a whole lot on it 
yet. One of the groups that has priority in receiving the alms are slaves 
buying their freedom; also debtors and travelers.

5: Hajj: if financially possible every Muslim will travel at some point to 
Mecca during Ramadan. (I can't even imagine how busy that city gets.) 
Something I did not know is that people get longer names when they make 
the trip: El Hadji for men and Aja-ratou for women.

Ablution, washing of the hands, feet and face is required before
performing a variety of actions, notably praying, sex and to touch the
Koran. I'd say in general I wash my hands 5 times a day here. Before all
my meals and very thoroughly after I go to the potty. =) Meals are eaten
with the right hand, or at least it is the only hand stuck in the bowl.
Something I noticed is that people will often not even wash their left
hand though they are going to be holding their bread with it. It makes me
think that the washing is ritualistic as much as practical.

Islam is interesting in Africa because Islam as a religion is fairly
uniform, but in Africa it mixed in with lots of local religions that
flavored many practices. For instance, there are people called Marabouts
("Mariboo"), who have a "special relationship with God" even though Islam
is very egalitarian in general. The grigri that I mentioned a while ago
has a Koranic verse written on it by a Marabout. It provides protection
against spirits.

Marabouts can also tell people how to get certain things that they desire, 
like fame or love or whatever. Fortunetelling is also against Islamic law, 
but it happens anyway. I don't remember if I mentioned it yet, but one 
day as we were lying around a woman took out some halves on cowrie shells 
and some coins and was tossing them out, looking at them and tossing them 
again. I am thinking she was gleaning meaningful information from it, 
though I am not sure how. =)

The Koran is an interesting book because, as Smith says, "it is not about
the truth, it is the truth" meaning God speaks in the first person and 
historical information is included incidentally as opposed to the Bible 
which is largely a historical document about the life of Jesus with the 
teachings woven into the story. It is interesting because most non-Muslims 
find reading the Koran to be difficult and boring because it is all 
straight opinion whereas most Muslims find the indirectness of other holy 
books to be troubling.

The ordering of the book speaks to its nature. It starts out with a first
"La ilaha illa 'illah" but after that the 114 surahs (chapters) are
ordered by length from 286 to 6 verses. There is no real concern for 
chronology or theme.

*-*

All in all, Smith paints a picture of Islam as a tolerant religion which, 
much like Christianity has sometimes has proponents who did things in its 
name which weren't really in line with its teachings.

I've got a little more to say about Sufism, but I'll wait on that. I've 
been writing for an hour now.

Love,
Will
