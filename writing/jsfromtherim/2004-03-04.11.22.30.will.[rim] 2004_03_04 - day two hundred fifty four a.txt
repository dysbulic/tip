I learned an English lesson today. I mispronounce the word tantamount.
(I drop the "t" and say "tan-a-mount" rather than tan-ta-mount.") I
also mispronounce the French word tellement. (I say "tell-eh-mehn"
rather than "tell-mehn".) I recognized I do it because at some point I
learned to mispronounce tantamount and after I somehow mapped the
pronunciation of tellement to it.

Ironically I think I mapped it in part because of what I thought the
meaning of both words was. I was going off the phrase, "it is of
tantamount importance" where tantamount is synonymous with "utmost."
My understanding is that tellement was an emphatic with a similar
meaning.

I managed to be wrong on pretty much every salient detail. Every
dictionary that I have consulted lists a single meaning for
tantamount, as a synonym for "equivalent." I was aware of this
meaning, but thought there was another. Apparently this second meaning
is solely a product of me misreading things throughout my adult life.
Also tellement is an emphatic, but in reality less emphatic than I
thought. The translation I found listed is "ever so" as in "she is
ever so beautiful" which is more subdued than "she is of the utmost
beauty."

It is amazing that I managed to somehow formulate a set of thoughts
that contained not one shred of accuracy. =) Ah well, c'est la vie.

Love,
Will
