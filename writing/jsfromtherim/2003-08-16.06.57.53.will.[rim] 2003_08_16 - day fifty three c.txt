Ok, I have 10 minutes and I am pretty sure I never told about the 
housing...

In the end it came down to the fact that Med doesn't actually own the 
house and so can't sign a legal contract renting a room. They still had 
the other reservations, but I couldn't argue with that one.

I am homeless yet, but the PC has a place that was the house of a past
volunteer until a couple weeks ago and it is paid through September, so
I'll probably stay there and hunt some more. Still like the family idea.  
I'd like it a whole lot if said family had an actual shower and toilet
like most of the apartments we are looking at. Best of both worlds. =)

Love,
Will

P.S. Completely unrelated to Africa, but I saw this link today and thought 
it was really cool.

It is called a wooden mirror. It is a panel with thousands of little 
pieces of wood on them. Each one is connected to a little motor and the 
whole bit is connected to a computer. A camera senses what is in front of 
the "mirror" and rotates each piece so that the light and dark of the 
refections look the same as what is in front of the camera. It updates 15 
times a second, so you can really move around in front of it and have it 
mirror.
