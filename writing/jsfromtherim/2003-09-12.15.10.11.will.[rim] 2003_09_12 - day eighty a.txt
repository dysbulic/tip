Well, it is done. I swore to uphold the Constitution and hang out in
Mauritania for the next two years. Je suis une volontaire.

I wore my new PC boubou to the ceremony and I personally think I was
looking pretty sporty. =) It is a really pretty dark blue and it has
the PC logo batiked on it. I was sweating like a whore in church, but
such is the price we beautiful people must pay.

We went through a couple speeches in French and then the stagiers gave
little hello's in French, Hassaniya, Pulaar and Wolof. The ambassador
seemed pretty cool. He gave his speech in Arabic then he gave us a
cool little speech in English. He had read our aspiration statements
that we wrote coming over and he worked in little excerpts from those.
He also referenced a New Yorker article discussing that people are
rarely as pleased by their accomplishments or disappointed as their
failures as they expect to be. He sort of worked that back in with our
expectations and looking forward now at two years.

Afterward we had some tasty chocolate cookies and sodas. I was
satiated sufficiently to just go on off and nap at that point, but we
also did a dinner. I didn't get very much of it personally; being at
the end of the line, but it looked tasty. My stomach is still settling
down so it was probably for the best. =)

There was some music, but it is damnably hot this evening. The wind
has chosen for whatever reason not to blow and it is easily 95 even
though the sun has gone down. I snuck off to the computer room to let
my shirt dry and send a little email. I've just started hearing the
dance music going, so the ambassador must have departed.

One interesting note from his speech before I go off to shake my
booty. He said that roughly 33% of PC applicants actually make it to
stage, and I heard elsewhere that roughly 15% of stagiers don't make
it through. Just thought those were interesting statistics.

We swore 80% of our group. Dan is in Nouakchott and I heard he got in
a little trouble for skipping some sessions. He's also having some
health problems that he has to have checked out. He is expected by
most everybody to swear in the next day or two.

Robert is a little more questionable. He was having both a little
trouble with the language and with the ICT program. I think that
either one wouldn't have held him back, but putting them together was
too much.

I've talked to a couple of people about bending the rules some. I
started coming about fifteen minutes late to my language classes
because my family was habitually late with coffee in the morning. Jay
was talking about sometimes skipping out on a peer review session.
Stuff like that. Robert did the same, in particular with our project
to teach a class. He didn't get the French ready and he didn't do the
class that he had communicated to Adda that he was going to (basics
of multimedia). Unfortunately Adda went out and found a real audience
and really got his end ready, so Bob's lack of effort really caught up
to him.

I feel like he was playing the same game as the rest of us. He just
misjudged and now he has to deal with those consequences. (Which are
to take a week of language in Nouakchott before retesting.) It is
light enough that I am almost certain they will swear him if he'll do
it. The question is what he is going to do now that the ball is in his
court.

I understand that not getting to swear really upset him. It certainly
would have me. I think he is planning on talking with Obie and I guess
things will go wherever they need to from there. He's a good worker
when he has something he is interested in. (Not so great when he
doesn't.) =) I just hope he manages to do what he needs to be happy.

Well, gonna go dance. =) Maybe call my parents later and chastise them
for not trying to call their now volunteer son after not having talked
to him for eighty days. Steph gave me a ring last night, but is having
calling card problems.

Love,
Will
