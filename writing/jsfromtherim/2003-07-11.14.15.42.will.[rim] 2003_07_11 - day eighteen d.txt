Delirious fever dreams. Yay. =)

I have been in my room all day because I can close the screens and kill 
the flies and sleep in relative peace. The problem is that the room gets 
pretty hot during the day. For instance they gave us some disposable 
thermometers that work using those little color changing dots. Mine are 
worthless right now because they apparently got exposed to heat in excess 
of 104 degrees and so have all changed colors. I've never lived in a place 
before when I stuck the thermometer in my mouth to cool it off.

I am planning on writing about some of my dreams, but I wanted to preface 
things a little with some psychology so that I don't worry anyone.

In "The Road Less Traveled" Peck discusses the idea that from early 
childhood we are creating evolving pictures of the nature of the universe. 
Places where our conceptualizations don't line up with actuality we end up 
with various types of dysfunction and abrasion.

For a simple example take something that commonly happens to only 
children. They become accustomed to being the sole important body in their 
parents' world and as they grow older many have issues with their 
relationships because they are unaccustomed to the give and take that 
adult relationships require.

Carl Rogers has a psychological method based around the concept that the 
individual has the ability to recognize where their conceptualizations 
abrade with reality. All that the psychologist normally has to do is 
provide a nonjudgmental "sounding board" for the patient to use in 
exploring their "map of reality".

Since I came to college I have been a part of a group that does, among
other things, introspective work. It draws from several schools, but there
is often a cognitive/humanistic bent.

One of the practices that is encouraged is regular journaling and a 
subset of that is so called "dump" journals. To hearken back to Peck the 
point is to capture an aspect of your map of reality as clearly as 
possible so that you may later return and examine it rationally. During 
the process of dumping though you simply write as honestly as you are able 
whatever your beliefs are.

While I was lying in bed melting I had several things come up that I would
like to write about. I want to make it clear though that this is only an
aspect of my conceptualization. Though I may write as though it is all
that I think; I know rationally that it is not.

So, read the next one knowing that...

Love,
Will

P.S. It turns out that the Africa sized cockroaches live in the toilet. I 
went out with my light the first time last night and after that decided it 
was best not to see.
