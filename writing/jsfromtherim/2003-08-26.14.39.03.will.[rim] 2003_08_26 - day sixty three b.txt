Poop journal, be forewarned...

By far my worst experiences here have had to with a lack of toilets. I was 
stricken again yesterday, and to not go into it at length, one of the big 
advantages to a boubou is it hangs down to cover the seat of your pants. 
Granted I don't have a boubou, but that is why it would have been nice for 
the walk between Habib's house and my own. (Yeah, ick, I know.)

The problem is that there isn't a place for makaresh storage like you 
might think there would be. The same pot is used for butt washing as hand 
washing and ablutions before prayer, and so it gets carried all over and 
left various places. So, you must hunt down the pot, then find some water 
for it, and then make it out to the hole. Sometimes this is just too much 
time. =)

Did I tell the poop story from Nouakchott? I forget. Gile and I were lying 
on matellas talking one night and one of the kids walks up right in front 
of us and drops a surprisingly big load about a foot away from us. The 
child had to weight about 1/3 less after this endeavor because it wasn't a 
very big kid, but he certainly gave it his all. (So to speak.)

Love,
Will
