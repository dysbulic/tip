So, I've been here in Aioun for the last four days or so hanging out
trying to get this lab up and running properly so that they can
open. Theoretically they were to open about two months ago, so if it
opens within a couple weeks we'll be right on schedule.

I've been staying with Hector and Genevieve and really liking it. They
have a beautiful house and I've gotten to share a bit of their
domesticity while staying with them. To date I have eaten:

  * chicken curry
  * enchiladas
  * rice pudding
  * tacos
  * fruit salads
  * bean salads
  * tomato salads
  * tacos
  * refried beans
  * yogurt
  * flan
  * chips and salsa
  * breakfast burritos
  * chicken stir-fry

Among other things... It has been just amazing the things they manage
to do. When we had the chips and salsa Genevieve made the chips from
scratch. They were a little thicker than what you'd buy in a store,
but still quite crisp and tasty.

When I got thorough in Ka√©di I was sick of the heat and the poverty
and flies and everything. I wanted to go to the city and get away from
it. The volunteer who was supposed to go to Aioun left during Stage
and I was afraid I'd be sent there in his place.

Having been here for a bit I'm thinking I'd actually like it quite a
bit. My place in the city is small and I though I have a reasonable
amount of free time I've been getting busier and busier in the last
couple weeks. The idea of being here just feels more spacious. Space
is something I've really been craving in the last few weeks. Space to
figure something out I think. I've been having spells of melodrama and
that is a pretty sure sign things are brewing.

I was talking to Hector this morning. I was able to talk to Hector
this morning! Good God, English and the ability to express complexity
are wonderful gifts. Anyhow, he said I could ask to switch with the
incoming volunteer who will be assigned to Aioun (to take the place of
the one that left last year). I've been thinking about it alot.

I would really miss my job though. I'm still getting into the swing of
teaching, but I really like it. As things progress I hope to get more
involved with the university proper and maybe start doing some linux
or programming classes.

I've gone over to the students' lab a couple of times to help them
out. The last time was illuminating. They were doing some program to
calculate something about a family. The input though had to not only
take a man's name, but up to four women to account for all the
possible wives. Things I would not have considered...

Well, I suppose I ought to do some work.

Love,
Will
