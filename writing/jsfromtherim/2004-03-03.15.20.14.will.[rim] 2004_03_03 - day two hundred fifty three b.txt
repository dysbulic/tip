Finished another couple books and want to give them their props...

_In Search of Schrodinger's Cat : Quantum Physics And Reality_ by John
Gribbin was a really enjoyable read. I've got very little background
in quantum physics other than seeing the double slit experiments
performed and knowing a little of the math. This book was very
readable though. It was less technical, but more engaging than _A
Brief History of Time_. As a book for a layman I think it is an
excellent balance.

It is about 20 years old now though and I don't know how it has stood
the test of time. I see that _Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for
Reality_ exists as a sequel to address the problem. That one is on my
list now of books to hunt up.

I think it definitely gets a recommendation for anyone who likes
science.

My second book was Katherine Neville's _The Magic Circle_. I wasn't
too terribly impressed, but there were at least two extenuating
circumstances. One is that she was doing a myth weaving sort of book
where she takes a variety of different mythological structures and
tries to connect them and build a story from them. I generally like
that sort of story since it appeals to my enjoyment of complexity and
pattern. I had just finished with Eco though who is in the same vein
and her weave wasn't as tight as his. Also with Eco I was pretty sure
that most all of the facts I was reading were real facts. With Neville
I assumed in general that she was following at least the outline of
myth, but it felt contrived at times and that affected my reading.

The other thing that kept me from getting into the book was the focus
on determinism. It dealt with mythic objects of power and their
influence on history as well as the complex and intertwined history of
the heroine's family. Both emphasize that the actors are somehow
players in part of a greater drama, but that never plays out in the
lives of the individuals. If she had done something with this great
movement of history toward some change I think I would have been fine
with it. As it was, it was just sort of laid out over and over as an
overbearing backdrop.

Still probably worth a read. From what I have been told though your
time would be better spent with _The Eight_.

I did have a happy French moment while reading though. There is a
description of a banner hanging off the Eiffel Tower commemorating the
two hundredth anniversary of the French Revolution. In the book it
says "deux cent ans" ("two hundred years"). In French though when you
have multiples of things like hundreds and thousands they are plural
as well, so there should be an "s" on "cents." The fact that I just
noticed the misspelling as I was reading over made me happy.

Love,
Will
