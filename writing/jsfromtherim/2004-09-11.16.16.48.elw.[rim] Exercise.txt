i vaguely remember that i learned those three tenses twice, in two 
different orders, in two different levels of french courses.

learning the passe simple first made sense about a year after i'd done the 
work - i realized the reasoning behind it sort of made a demented kind of 
sense.

don't remember exactly why, now, though.
