Well, not dead, happily. I had the full intention of staying up most of
the night to work and collect hostel information and stuff before heading
to Casa, but then the power went out at the uni. So i went home and had
some oatmeal and figured I'd take a little nap before going over to the
bureau which has generators.

Well, apparently the operation of my telephone's alarm was too complex for
me because I didn't wake up until my normal alarm at 7:30. This is a bit
troubling since I was planning on being at the airport at 7:00.

I got a call yesterday telling me that my flight on Air Moroc was canceled
and I would be flying Air Mauritania. Turns out Air Moroc is on strike.
Well, he said the flight was now at 8 and I said fine, then at the end he
made it sound like check-in was at 8, but attempting to verify this in
French caused communication to break down.

So, as I am getting ready to go I am doing so knowing full well my plane
has about a 50/50 chance of being in the air before I get there. This
distresses me since I figure it'll be hard enough to make it to Paris in 5
days and there's no way I'll do it in 3.

As you may have guessed though everything worked out. I made it to
Casablanca where I was told I could go ahead and but my ticket all the way
to Tanger (Tangiers) for 150dh (15euro), so 8 hours later I was in Tanger
and I leave on a boat for S?te, France tomorrow night. (26 hours, 805dh)

So far it is really cool. My habit of talking to any random person who
comes up to me is costing me a bit. So far I've given 40dh to street
people and spent 20dh on food, but I'm getting guided around a lot of the
city.

The view out over the Atlantic is spectacular. Prices are high for what
I'm used to, but I'm living on bread and water mostly. I did buy a kilo of
strawberries for 6dh. (0.6 euro) That was a definite treat. I'm planning
on getting a couple bijous and eating nice tonight. I was hoping that I'd
run into someone here to hang out with, but this is not a very touristy
season. This would be more fun with some company.

Well, I've got a couple more messages to send. Hope all is well back home
and I'll see some of you in about three days in Paris, inshallah.

Love,
Will
