I've been doing alot of eating out in the last couple days. We are in
Nouakchott and several sites got a little layover. Since this was many
people's first time out of Kaédi there were alot of people wanting to
go out to eat.

I've been to most of the major restaurants in town over the last few
days and I'll just run them down...

Chang Hwong - There is a Chinese place within walking distance of the
bureau. It is run by a Chinese family and the food is pretty good. It
is definitely a step up from the stuff you get off of a buffet. The
one problem I have is they don't use the Chinese names, the menu is
translated into French. So for instance the other night I had
something like "soup with little raviolis," but it was really wonton
soup. Something that is very cool about this one is that they give
PCV's half off.

Il Capriccio - I went here both during site visit and again the other
night. I had a calzone and some sorbet the first time. The calzone was
thin crusted and tasty, but nothing to write home about. The sorbet
was a religious experience and on my return trip all I had was the
sorbet. =)

Pizza Lina - One of two pizza shops. During site visit, I had some
sort of spaghetti with cream sauce and ham. It was tasty. I went back
the other night and has an American Pizza. In America our pizzas have
ground beef, ham and green peppers. Not bad, though like the calzone
all crusts in Mauritania are thin.

Ma Pizza - Another pizza place with basically the same choices but a
deal for two pizzas at 1000um apiece. I'm not much of a connoisseur,
so this place works well for me too. =)

Chez Tiviski - This is the local extension of the Tiviski Dairy. I
mentioned before that you can go here and get passable ice cream. (I
think it melts between where it is produced and this freezer, so it is
refrozen ice cream if you've ever had that.) The other interesting
thing is the containers. It's all random tupperware and I went by last
night and saw that they had a container twice as big as the one we got
the other night. One of the things that they have that I'm gonna try
soon is camel milk.

Burger Hot - There are a chain of "Hot" restaurants. So far I have
seen Burger Hot, Pizza Hot and Chicken Hot. I had a burger from Burger
Hot and it was on par with what I'd get at a diner somewhere in the
States.

La Palmarie - Last but certainly not least is La Palmarie. It is a
French restaurant with a really nice looking terrace and a little café
area where you can have pastries and coffee. The food is pretty good.
When I went I didn't have enough money to get anything more than ice
cream.

And therein lies the problem. I need to spend about 1000um a day to
get my budget to work out. A meal at any of these places ranges
between 1000um - 2000um. I have started just having ice cream most of
the time and that is still usually around 800um. It is going to be
tempting to go out alot when everyone is coming into town and wanting
to go out. (Since this is about the only town with "expat" restaurants
like I listed.) I'll rapidly be begging for money if I do this though,
so I'm going to have to save these places for special treats.

Love,
Will
