Another Friday has rolled around. It is about 5:00 at night and I am just
getting out of bed because my water drinking finally caught up with me. I
woke up this morning with a very urgent call to the bathroom. After making
it successfully, mashallah, I didn't feel too bad and went back to bed.

I woke up about half an hour later though and wasn't happy at all. The 
room was spinning and it took quite a bit of concentration to get it to 
stop. My stomach was also churning and my head hurt. I just lay in bed for 
a while because as dizzy as I felt moving just made me feel nauseous. 
Alienating periods of dizziness, sleeping, and refusing offers of food, a 
bath or a change of scenery has been all of my day.

Carl just stopped by though on his way to the beach though and I talked to 
him for  bit and am currently feeling fine. My room is a little stuffy, 
but I can move without passing out, so I'm not complaining.

I really don't think I am done, but a brief reprieve is nice. Robert has 
been sick for the last two weeks. He went out last night though and he and 
Jay stopped by this afternoon planning on walking to the bureau. I guess 
he's a different type of sickness than me, but I'd rather lie around and 
be real sick for two days than be mildly sick for two weeks.

*-*

Every PCT has to do a final project apparently. Some piece of work to show 
your willingness to take initiative and capacity to produce something. For 
the ICT volunteers our projects were bumped up a couple weeks because we 
needed to be do them while here in Nouakchott (nobody actually told me 
why, maybe so that different people could be present.) So the last week 
has been mostly preparing the final project and that is why I haven't 
written at all.

I'm going to do a couple catchups now though.

Love,
Will
