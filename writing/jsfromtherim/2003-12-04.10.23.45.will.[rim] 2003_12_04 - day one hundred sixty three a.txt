Today we celebrated International Volunteer Day. The day is actually 
tomorrow, but Friday is Sunday in Mauritania, so we couldn't do it then. 
  I started the morning out bright and early at 7:15 so I could have 
plenty of time to make it to the UN by 8. Then I started it again rushed 
and unbathed when I woke up the second time at 7:50, but still managed 
to make it on time thanks to my trusty bike.

I arrived to discover Marc had already been taken off to parts unknown. 
Fortunately I ran into Megan who is a UN volunteer. She is ex-PC 
Mauritania from the mid-90's. She has been working with the World Food 
Program in the south and I met her in Kaédi. For the next half hour or 
so I followed her around since she knew people and could speak French.

Eventually Jay arrived and we were packaged up into a pickup and carted 
to the Sebkah high school. We arrived at a tent where we stood around 
for about two hours or so.

Jay was explaining to me from a book he is reading called Ebéne how 
meetings work here. In America we set the time and the place and that's 
when the meeting starts. In Africa they set the place and suggest a time 
and the meeting starts when everyone gets there.

Our meeting today had lots of important people, so we had quite a bit of 
waiting to do. We did have music to keep us occupied though and that 
helped a bit.

After some speeches we had some songs and some skits about both AIDS 
(since this is also world AIDS week) and a couple comedian sort of 
fellows. It was almost completely in Hassaniya and Pulaar so I didn't so 
much understand anything. We were outside the high school, so we had a 
good showing of students that wandered out to see what was going on. 
They seemed entertained.

 From there we went in search of either lunch or a way to be productive; 
whichever proved more readily available. We ended up watching some 
people collect trash for a bit, but since we were doing a "community 
involvement" theme we didn't do anything but watch.

Something that was really cool was some dancing broke out on the street 
while we were standing around. There were a group of women and children 
and they had a big metal bowl they were keeping a beat on. They formed a 
sort of circle and people would go in and out of the center dancing and 
jumping around. It was just really inspiring to see everyone having fun 
like that. I think America would be a better place if it had more 
spontaneous dance parties. I think it would also be a better place if we 
could have that much fun supplied with only ourselves and a metal bowl.

A truck came by after a bit and took the trash off. We left to again 
search work or food. This time we found some trees. We had a moringa and 
a neem. The neem is a usual tree here, but the moringa is a tree that 
several aid organizations are trying to introduce from India. It 
supposedly grows quickly and fares well in arid regions. It has lots of 
vitamins and can be used to make flour. There are several agfo 
volunteers working with it and it is sometimes called the miracle tree here.

Unfortunately Al-Jazeera (the Arabic news service) has reportedly had 
some programs saying things like moringa causes cancer and to avoid it. 
We took our moringa to someone's house and she liked it, but her 
daughter who was not there now is afraid it will bring bad luck and may 
try to kill it.

It will have a hard enough time as it is. I mentioned before that the 
name of the quartier was Sebkha. Sebkha in Arabic means salt. The 
quartier is out by the ocean and the soil is saturated with salt. There 
are regions that are white with it like the salt flats in Utah. One of 
the nasty things about the salt is that not only does it keep things 
from growing it also corrodes. I'm sure most of you are familiar with 
salt eating metal; well, it will also eat cheap concrete. Almost all of 
the building in that area are in various stages of decay beginning where 
the walls touch the ground. There were several walls that only had the 
mortar left at the bottom with whole blocks still remaining on top.

So, we watched some tree planting and then came back to the bureau to 
eat and piddle on the computer.

Tomorrow we have an invitation to visit someone from the embassy who has 
Terminator 3! I'm definitely excited about that.

Love,
Will

P.S. Called my tutor today; finally. Only took me three months.

P.P.S. This is day 163 of 815. That's 20% exactly. At this point time is 
moving faster than I would like.
