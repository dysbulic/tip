We went over to Obie's last night and watched the Super Bowl. I enjoyed 
it a surprising amount. Generally I've never watched football. Marc is 
from Alabama though while Matt and Carl are from Vermont and California, 
so we picked up sides based on geography and I pretty much always get a 
kick out of calling people yankees.

The one drawback to watching at Obie's is that his satellite is the 
Armed Forces Network. They cut out all the normal commercials and 
replace them with little PSAs on stuff like credit card debt, depression 
and sunscreen. Definitely not as entertaining as the original commercials.

I've been trying to watch some of them on adage.com today with limited 
success. Windows Media Player is decidedly not cooperating with me.

The other interesting part was that the game started at 11:45pm and 
continued 'til around 4am. It was really nice of Obie to host us so 
early into the morning.

I slept most of the day in preparation, but I am still pretty tired. I 
think I am going to head home and hit the hay soon.

Love,
Will
