We just did our session on "maintaining credibility as a volunteer."
The picture that they painted was a little bleak, but I think that
things will work out.

They started us our with a "imagine some foreigner comes into your
office back home. They don't really speak English well. They don't
understand how the office works. They aren't especially incompetent,
but they aren't especially competent either. How are you going to
treat this person?"

(I'm not supposed to use "they" for a gender neutral third person
singular pronoun, but I think that's crap. As I pay more attention to
the genderedness of language I think things need to be done. It is too
polar.) =)

I think that in many ways my situation will be different. It will be
harder in that in Nouakchott my novelty value is pretty low, so I'll
not have people really wanting to talk to me simply because of my
white skin. Also, making community contacts is just generally harder.
I am realizing more and more that my integration experience is likely
going to be inversely proportional to my comfort.

In some ways it will be easier because the information I know about
computers is pretty good and I can generally hold my own technically.
I am hoping that it won't be too difficult to establish my reputation
on that axis.

I am running into more though (or at least comprehending better) the
degree to which my limited grasp of the language is interpreted as a
lack of intelligence. It is frustrating to have an adult mind and the
tongue of an absent-minded child. =) I remember reading stories of
people who suffered brain damage which only affected their speech
centers in such a way that they could still think and still make
sounds, but they couldn't speak. That has got to be supremely
frustrating. It isn't something external like losing the voice
entirely; it is a matter of ability and that is something (especially
Westerners) conceptualize of as something that you should be able to
have an effect on.

Anyway, the gist of the session was "just hang out, start small, make
friends, pay attention." Nothing really dramatic. The interesting bits
were in the discussion that followed.

One interesting one was a volunteer describing a faux pas that she
committed. She walked into a room to tell a woman that her husband was
on the phone and did so in the presence of the woman's father. The
woman ran out of the room and was very ashamed. It turns out that the
father and son-in-law have almost no contact at all.

The volunteer said that one person explained it as "when the father
sees the husband and wife together he can't help but think about them
having sex." Another Mauritanian at the meeting said that wasn't it,
but that it was just a woman couldn't show respect to her husband and
her father at the same time.

Another interesting thing that they talked about it is there is an
actual term "toubab time" that people use. "Local time" means "this
meeting scheduled for 8 will happen whenever, God willing." "Toubab
time" means "this meeting scheduled for 8 will happen at 8." I didn't
know that difference in the conceptualization of time was so widely
understood. It also means though that Mauritanians expect us to be
prompt because they know that is part of our culture.

We're two days out. Hopefully I'll be able to send you all these
before I'm actually a volunteer. =)

Love,
Will
