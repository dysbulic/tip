The day after Thanksgiving was another of those lie around, read a
little French and then sleep some more days. Unfortunately I had the
bright idea of going to the bureau around 5p.m. and ended up killing
most of the night there. By the time I decided to go home it was too
late to so I just kept working.

One of the things I made was a cover for a CD label:

Then about 9a.m. I got a call from an ex-PCV from Morocco named Xerces.
He had spent the last couple weeks up in the Adrar and he was in town
looking to find some souvenirs before leaving town.

So, being nice and what	not I forwent sleep to take him around town.

We started with the African fellows, but that was all stuff Xerces had 
seen in Guinea where he was the last year. Next we went over to the 
March√© Capitol and wandered through the row of guys there selling stuff. 
We looked at pipes and teapots and some boxes. Then out to Cinquieme 
where we visited Carl's new house and had some tasty chub-e-jen. We 
wandered a bit with Carl, but didn't find anything particularly 
Mauritanian other than the fabrics and Xerces didn't want those.

 From there we went to Racey's to ask if she knew of any good places. On 
her recommendation we went over to some artsy sort of shops. We looked 
at alot of the same stuff from Capitol, but better made. We went back 
over to Capitol for one more check there and finally ended up in the 
artsy shops again.

Xerces bargained hard for about half an hour and eventually got a wooden 
chest about 3.5'x2'x2' for 9000um (starting price 18000um) and a little 
ebony box with silver work for 10000um (starting price 15000um). He 
worked hard for it and I was glad I went with him because I can have 
some idea of what to shoot for now.

 From there we had dinner, I went home and slept til 1:00 today. It is 
midnight again so I am going to go sleep.

Love,
Will
