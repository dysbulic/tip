My 6:30 car got bumped to 8 and it is 10 now. I figured I'd try to start 
doing something. If I can get sufficiently involved for it to be really 
inconvenient then I'm sure we'll leave. Supposedly right now we'll 
arrive at around 3 in the morning tomorrow. I'll get about a day there 
before beginning the 12+ hours back. Now the car isn't even coming all 
the way back in time so I have to catch a taxi in Aleg if I want to make 
it back here before class starts. I'm gonna be grumpy next week I bet. =)

I managed to get my clothes washed and mostly dried. Doing the wash left 
my hands bleeding. The desert has dried and cracked my feet til they 
look like clay. I haven't so much as lifted a finger in the last three 
months though. I've got city boy hands now. That's a sad state of 
affairs, how can I expect people to respect me if I use uncalloused 
hands to shake with them?

Back home I spent alot of time on the computer but living with Wayne and 
Brett I could at least count on the occasional digging of a hole of 
wielding of a hammer. Maybe I can get to work on a well somewhere. That 
looks like some real work.

Love,
Will
