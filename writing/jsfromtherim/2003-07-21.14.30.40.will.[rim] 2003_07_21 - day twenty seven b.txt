I saw myself in a mirror yesterday and I am looking pretty well 
considering it is the first time in about a week and a half that I have 
appeared in one. I am having a little trouble with my back in that the 
blisters that formed a little bit ago are sort of rubbing raw, but it is 
just irritating and not really a problem. What is more disturbing is how 
dry my skin is. It is almost like before a sunburn will start peeling 
though I haven't been exposed to the sun. Just very very dry to the point 
that it seems like it might crack.

I guess I need to drink more water. I have only been getting maybe two 
liters a day. At the beginning I was probably getting four and feeling 
much better.

I'm lying outside on a mattela and the scrawniest excuse for a cat I've 
ever seen just walked by. It is hard to imagine that thing is not the 
bottom of the food chain.

I recognized today that we spend money differently here in part because it
is so many bills. I have the connotation of meaningful expense when I whip
out some bills to pay for something. A canned soda for instance seems
expensive taking a 100um bill. At 285um to the dollar though that soda
only cost $.35.

The literacy rate in Mauritania is somewhere around 30% according to Jay. 
This surprised me in part because many Muslim countries have higher 
literacy rates because writing is learned as part of the process of 
memorizing the Koran.

We had class today adjacent to a slew (about 30) of youngsters learning
the Koran. There was lots and lots of recitation. Arabic has a pleasing
cantor for chanting and some of the beauty of the writing of the Koran is
in hearing it spoken. As soothing as it is though it is not especially
conducive to the learning of French having 30 kids speaking it in the next
room.

*-*

I showed Habib my picture of Steph that she sent me and he has been
working her into my lessons now. Today's was: "j'ai envoie de visiter avec
ma petite-amie, Stephanie." It is bittersweet saying such things because I 
really do miss her.

*-*

Other interesting French knowledge. You don't say, "I'm hot" in French. 
You say "I have hot." It turns out that saying "I'm hot" has different 
connotations and that I have been proclaiming my sexual availability for 
the last month.

Another interesting anecdote is from Robert. You aren't hungry, you have 
hunger and the word if "faim". Like most French though the final consonant 
is not pronounced, so when his family asked him why we was not eating more 
he claimed "je n'ai pas femme" ("I have no woman".) He said that quite 
entertained them.

Well, it is late and I have an early morning, so good night all.

Love,
Will
