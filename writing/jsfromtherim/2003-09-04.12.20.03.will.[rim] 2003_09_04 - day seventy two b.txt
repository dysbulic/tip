In a disturbing development my mail seems to be broken. I send
messages and the computer tells me "ok, I can't send that now, I'll
hold on to it for you (queued in computerspeak)." But then when I ask
it "what are you holding for me?" It says, "huh? you didn't give me
anything." Things aren't getting lost completely because I have a copy
of what I send, but I don't know what has actually made it out onto
the net and what wandered off into the ether somewhere.

I'll figure it out eventually. =)

*-*

Habib and I had a pretty enjoyable set of classes yesterday. Robert
has gone off to another teacher because he didn't feel like he was
getting what he needed, and so it is just Habib and I.

I explained the concepts of "a date" and "dating" and stuff like that
yesterday. The word that he knew in English for the romantic process
was courting and I explained that things tend to be more egalitarian
nowadays than just the man trying to win the woman's heart. There's
more a sense of both parties trying each other out.

I told him that there are different types of dating and with "casual
dating" it is permissible for someone to have dates with multiple
partners at different times. This seemed a little scandalous to him.
=) Usually though the terms "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" are reserved
for "exclusive dating."

I asked how people managed to find each other here and he said that
marriage is much more a family affair for Mauritanians. His family
knows her family and the two decide to join with a marriage. The girl
in particular doesn't get to choose her husband the first time out.
After she has been divorced she may do as she pleases, but before the
family must do what is necessary to protect the family honor.

Well, I need to go get clean. I have fallen into the rather odoriferous
habit of bathing every other day. =)

Love,
Will
