Having a boil cleared is a rather unpleasant process. It involves
quite a bit of squeezing and bleeding and pain. In my case it also
involves a quarter inch hole left in my knee.

As unpleasant as it is though the subsequent packing of the hole with
sterile gauze is less entertaining. The whole process was rather
twisted. First comes pushing and squeezing and pulling to get a big
chunk of pus out of my knee. Having done all this bloody and painful
work to make the hole she just filled it back up with gauze.

On the bright side though I'm on the road to recovery hopefully and
I'll be able to walk semi-normally in a week.

Love,
Will
