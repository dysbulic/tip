On the subject of eggs I searched the Internet on the self life of a
hard boiled egg and was entertained by the writings from:

  http://www.wranglernews.com/easteregg.htm

"My family was (and is) what I like to refer to as 'germ-conscious',
 what someone else might call borderline obsessive-compulsive.
"Eggs were thought of as small grenades of salmonella. To eat an egg
 that was raw or undercooked (in mousses, mayonnaise or Caesar
 salad--even, alas, in cookie dough) was to play fast and loose with
 life itself.
"To eat an egg that had been outside of refrigerated containment for
 more than an hour, nestled in grass that lodged microbes too numerous
 to conceive...well, that was anathema.
"Our ancestors, of course, shared neither these concerns nor the
 affluence that permits their indulgence. The Easter egg tradition 
 began in the 15th century, when the eggs that were forbidden to
 Christians during Lent were collected and saved for Easter.
"They were dipped in fat or wax to preserve them, colored and decorated
 to make them more appealing. Can you imagine? Not just an hour without
 temperature-controlled, artificial refrigeration, but 40 days. It
 rather puts things in perspective, but I don't think I'd like to eat
 those eggs, either."

*-*

On other food note: last night as I was sitting with my egg I learned
Mauritania has an ice cream truck. Well, an approximation, it has a
fellow with a cart who wanders around neighborhoods tootling his
bicycle horn.

Ramadan is starting at the end of this month. People will not be doing
so much as drinking water while the sun is up. Seems like this is
going to put a rather serious kink in the ice cream man's business
model. =)

Love,
Will
