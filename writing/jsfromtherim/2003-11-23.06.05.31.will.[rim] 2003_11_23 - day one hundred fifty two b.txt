I discovered some useful study tips yesterday. I had opened all of my 
packages and had them lying around my bed. When I woke up the only things 
within reach were the French books that Grandma sent me. Unfortunately the 
only food within reach were the jelly beans that Stephanie sent me. I 
ended the day with a better working knowledge of French, no jelly beans 
and a stomach ache.

Not getting out of bed until 4:00 in the afternoon was nice. I've been 
keeping pretty busy as of late and some downtime was definitely called 
for.

Love,
Will
