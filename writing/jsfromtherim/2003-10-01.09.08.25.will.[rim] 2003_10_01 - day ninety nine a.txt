We went and talked to the dean yesterday. There are two professors from 
the CS department here who have taken the semesters one and two training 
and that were going to go to Dakar as well. Cisco corporate wants the 
University to cover these expenses and the Dean says there isn't the 
money. He wants to instead bring the trainers up here to do the training 
at the University. It makes good financial sense and we are still 
waiting to see if that rides with Cisco Corporate.

In other news I went to the bank today to try and get some money to pay 
rent. Some people have been having trouble getting money at all. They go 
and they are told simply "you can't have that much." The general 
consensus is there is either a conservation of funds for use in the 
election or they are trying to push up the value of the ougia for the 
election. All that I got to do was fill out a form and be told, "come 
back tomorrow."

I'm really torn on my living situation. I like the apartment where I am, 
but I'd really like to have the extra 15,000 or so I'd have living at 
Matt's. (He is going to give his 20,000 um apartment and mine is 30,000 
+ utilities.) I'm going to see me some Africa while I'm here, by golly.

Well, Malick and I are going to work on the Academy's website a bit. So 
far I have helped him make a tacky flashing gif. =)
