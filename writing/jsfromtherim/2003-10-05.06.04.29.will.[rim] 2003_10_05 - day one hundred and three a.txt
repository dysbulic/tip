I've not got much interesting to report other than a pleasant weekend. I 
fiddled on he computer quite a bit and am playing with mapping now. 
Nothing interesting to show yet though.

So, this morning's entry is just a bit of cuteness...

Nouakchott is far enough north that there isn't much agriculture. So, 
most vegetables and fruits get shipped up from the South. What exactly 
comes in varies depending on the season and we left mangoes a couple 
weeks ago and seem to be heading into something like watermelons.

Big trucks come in with hundreds and hundreds of melons and they go out 
to the various parts of the city. In the course of unloading these 
trucks some melons fall on the ground and crack. Most of these are still 
serviceable, but a few are too badly damaged. These are left on the 
ground and the local livestock inevitably comes to take care of it. As 
you can imagine, eating a watermelon without the aid of hands is a 
little challenging, so as I was walking home yesterday I was treated to 
a herd of goats with satiated looks on pink faces.

Love,
Will

P.S. On the subject of mapping, if anyone knows a place where I could 
find a latitude/longitude bounding box (preferably with second 
precision) for Mauritania I'd be much obliged.
