Subject: [rim] Laughter

It has been argued that laughter serves a largely social purpose.

The idea is that the main point of laughter is to convey social
signals. Bob tells a bad joke and we laugh at him. We are
significantly more likely to do so if Bob is much higher than us in
the social milieu. We also laugh release tension in a situation or if
someone near us is laughing.

An important unexplored aspect of this research are the writings of
David Sedaris. I've been reading Me Talk Pretty for the last couple
days and I've laughed out loud more reading that book than in the last
month with my friends. This arguably speaks poorly of my friends, but
I prefer to think of it as reflecting well on Sedaris.

The book has some really good essays on his experience dealing with
being an American in Paris and taking French classes. It really
resonates with me in a very funny way. I like him more that Spalding
Gray in the genre of interior monologue outed which is saying a lot.

So that is the book recommendation du jour. Other title for the week
is Women Who Run with Wolves by Clarissa Pinkola Est?s (her middle
name really is Pinkola, who does that to their kid?) It is alright. If
I liked reading analysis more I would have gotten more into it. I like
the Jungian ideas in general, but there was too much of her talking
and not enough stories in my opinion.

Love,
Will
