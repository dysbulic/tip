This is a question that I hope will be of general interest, so I will 
answer it publcally. =)

When I actually become a volunteer we will open bank accounts at a local
bank to hold our money. (We get paid quartery, so we will all have a
sizeable chunk of change to hold on to.) The accounts are ougia accounts,
but we have the ability to open a dollar account at the bank as well where
we can store, withdraw and recieve wire transfers of dollars.

Supposedly wire transfers are not a terribly expensive thing to do. I was 
hoping that I could find a bank that was French based because paypal can 
do funds-transfers to French banks for free, but no luck on that just 
yet.
