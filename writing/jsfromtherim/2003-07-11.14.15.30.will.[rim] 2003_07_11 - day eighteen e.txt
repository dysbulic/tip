Well, all that prefacing for nothing. I started into writing and found 
that alot of relationship stuff was coming up with regards to Steph and 
I'm not as public about my interpersonal issuses as I am about my 
intrapersonal ones.

The gist of it was just that I'm not happy with my accomplishments in my
life to date, particularly professionally, and escaping that lies as some
of my motivations that I am not proud of.

Love,
Will
