5:30pm - We are all through with staging now. We are free to roam Philly 
until 11:00am tomorrow when the bus takes us to NYC then it is off to 
Paris and on to Nouakchott (which is pronounced, not Nolichucky, but 
Noahck-chuht.) We will stay there until the 29th when we will travel to 
the training center in Kaedi.

From there we will supposedly be breaking up into groups and wandering off
into the countryside. We will be gathered together every 10-12 days to
work together. It ought to prove interesting.

I do not know what my internet access will be like for a bit. I really
don't know if I'll even have power, though I really hope that I do. It
wouldn't be as big of a problem except for the fact that this battery
doesn't hold a charge anymore, (a semi-common lithium-ion problem) so once
it is unplugged it will stay on for only about 5 minutes.

I'm sure that everything will work out...

Notes for the day:

They told us that from the PC accident reports the most common words are:
  1. Alcohol
  2. At night
  3. In the capital
  4. Alone

Our leader, Chad Fleck, closed with a quote he discovered while working in 
Nepal:
  "Go with the people.
     Live with them.
       Learn from them.
         Love them.

   "Start with what they know.
      Build with what they have.

   "But, with the best of leaders,
    when the task is done,
    the people will say, 
    'we have done it ourselves.'" 

It is from the Tao Te Ching, but in Steven Mitchell's translation (which 
is the one I have read frequently) the last stanza is all there is. I 
really like the more personable Taoism that this represents and I think it 
really connects more with the compassion. Maybe I'll go try and find me a 
new Tao Te Ching tonight. =) Aaron complained of Mitchell flavoring his 
work alot and I think I should have listened to him.

(On a related note, I tried once again to say what the "three treasures" 
of Taoism were last night and could only remember compassion and poverty. 
I really need to get that last one down.) =)

Gonna go try and find some calling cards to make my last calls home. 
Couldn't get the stamps, but I should be able to tomorrow morning.

Love,
Will

P.S. With the yellow fever vaccine there is:
       1 in 131,000 doses have a "life threatening allergic reaction"
       1 in 150-250,000 doses have "severe nervous system reactions"
       1 in 200-300,000 doses (1 in 40-50,000 of those over 60) have
             "severe illness with major organ failure; more than 50% die"

P.P.S. I've been sharing all the scary stuff because it helps me get it 
out and to let it go. I hope that none of you reading this get too 
stressed over it. I am paying attention to it all and I'll be careful.
