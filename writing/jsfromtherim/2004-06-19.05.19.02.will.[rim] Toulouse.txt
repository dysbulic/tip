Well, plans changed again. Marc decided to stay another day, so I decided to
stay and do the boat. If I'd have stayed and gone to Madrid I wouldn't have
even stayed the night because the bus is a night bus leaving at 11:30pm and
arriving at 10:30am.

So, this morning I left Marc's grandparents and have been wandering the
streets for the last four hours searching for a place to sleep. It is
raining and I am carrying about 60lbs of stuff, so this is less entertaining
than it could be. On the bright side I'm learning I really like my new
backpack.

Option #1 was the youth hostel. It is now out of buisness. Option #2 was a
hotel we passed yesterday with 21? rooms. It is full. So I'm here now trying
to figure out option #3. Sleeping in a park is not an especially attractive
option. Paying 50? for a room isn't though either.

I figure if worst comes to worst I'll do one night in an expensive place and
take the rain to S?te and sleep in the boat station. The internet is
providing some promising prospects.

Marc made a distinction between a trip, which is focused mainly on seeing
things, and a vacation, which is largely about relaxing. I think I am going
to need a vacation after this trip.

Love,
Will
