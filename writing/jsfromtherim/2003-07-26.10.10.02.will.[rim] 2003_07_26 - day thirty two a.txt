I started this yesterday, but didn't finish it till today, so the tenses 
are off a little.

*-*

I guess it is easy to tell when my days off are. =)

Well, Wusaliman came back and we went to the beach together. It is quite a 
cool place. It takes about 10 minutes to get there by car from here. We 
never did catch up with Matt, Robert, Carl and Sharif. I wasn't terribly 
troubled though. In many ways I liked it more because when we all walk 
around speaking English with each other it sort of pulls us out of 
everything. As it was I couldn't even get as far out of the experience as 
chatting would have gotten me since casual conversation is still beyond my 
reach.

Fortunately we picked up someone else on the way and he and Wusaliman 
could chat. I dislike the idea of boring my host.

The place where you get to the beach is a big fish market. In true
Mauritanian style it is a very dirty place. Perhaps though, not very much
more so than docks in other places. There's the usual amount of garbage,
but the daily cleaning of fish has left the sand mixed with lots of
scales.

The first thing that you see is the huge line of canots which are fishing
boats maybe 25 or 30 feet long. They go out in shifts apparently, sit
about 100 yards out and, according to both Wusaliman and Habib, just pull 
the fish in all day. Mauritania reportedly has the richest fishing waters 
in the world.

I saw quite a few fish coming in today and this is everyone's day off.

Something else that was really interesting is apparently puffer fish suck 
at staying in the water. I saw maybe two dozen as we walked down the 
beach. There were some the size of soccer balls.

Another plentiful creature is mussels. They are not very big, 1" - 1.5",
but there certainly is alot of them. I pulled them out of the sand during
three waves washing over and I got about 20. There's a picture of them as
well.

I walked around for a bit while Wusaliman played keep away with some folks
in the ocean and his friend rested on the beach. The beach was very 
comfortable today (though it was overcast) and once everything settles 
down maybe I can visit with some regularity and maybe jog or something.

There were two main parts that we visited. The fishing part with the boats 
and then the tourist part with all the people. Everyone was sort of 
clustered in together and there were soccer balls galore. Generally it 
seems like the games were very open and people just all played together.

I've never been real big on ball sport, maybe it's an eyesight thing, 
maybe its just coordination. I saw something that I would love to try 
though. They have "combat" which is African wrestling. It looks to be just 
about the same thing just fewer rules about grabbing clothes and it's not 
the shoulders or the amount of time that matters, only that your  back 
goes down.

We saw some kids screwing around and I asked Omar (Wusaliman's friend) 
about it and he made it sound like a pretty common thing. Then as we were 
walking out we saw about 40 guys gathered in a ring. In the middle were two 
combatants and off to the side was a fellow drumming. I got an adrenaline 
rush just being on the side. I would absolutely love to try it.

The combatants were in really good shape, but their wrestling form was
pretty rough. The thing is though that all that went on was standing and
alot of the time poor form in wrestling could be leveraged to get your
opponent on the mat on the bottom and then pin them from there. Both of 
the guys I was watching kept their legs pretty straight and mad their 
weight forward which would be good for yanking them forward and onto their 
knees. If you are expected to let them get back up though it isn't good 
for much other than irritating someone.

Good form or no, I'd get my pudgy white ass kicked currently. The people
here play hard. Sharif gave us a heads up on some places to check out for
exercise though: the stadium has a pretty good gym and it is something
like 1500um a month or the American Embassy has a little pool and some 
nautilus equipment. Also, Matt, Carl and I put in for bikes, so hopefully 
I'll be able to get around town without breaking the bank.

I got some pictures of the combat as well as a couple little videos (which
are in Quicktime and I spent two hours in the cyber downloading mplayer at
1.5kB/s so I could watch. It works though, mashallah.)

At the end of it we ended up walking back (about 3 miles) because 
apparently having a white guy along raised the price too high to find a 
taxi. It is by far the longest walk I have taken and I think the long walk 
in sandals on sand hurt my right foot some since it has been sore since.

Anyhow, the beach is very cool and I hope to go often.

Love,
Will
