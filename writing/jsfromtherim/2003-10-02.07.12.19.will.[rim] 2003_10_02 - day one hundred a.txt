I am really getting stretched thin. That's really how it feels, like I
can't move as much to adapt to things like I could before.

Today I was walking to the bureau and a guy came up to me telling me
that his baby was sick and he didn't have a job and he wanted money to
buy medicine. I have about 7000 to my name right now and I had 3000 in
my wallet. When he came up to me though my response wasn't compassion
it was exasperation.

The other night as I was going into my house a guy stopped me coming
in and told me that where the shower drains to was full and he needed
to have a truck come and empty it. I asked him how much it costs and
he told me 6000. There are three apartments which share the same tank,
so he said 2000.

I knew that this was a little off because the guy who lives next to me
has been gone for the last three months as have I except for a couple
weeks during stage. The family downstairs is a family of six or more
and so it really wasn't fair for us to split it three ways.

The disheartening thing though is that when I saw the landlord the
next day he told me that it only cost 3000 to empty the tank. This is
the first time that I know I have been outright lied to about money.
When haggling prices that is not really lying because the price isn't
fixed.

There is a Tennyson quote: "That a lie which is half a truth is ever
the blackest of lies."

So with the fellow today I don't know if he is telling the truth. I
don't know if he has a baby; I don't know how much medicine costs. All
I know for sure is that someone else has seen my white skin and
decided they can get some money from me.

This exasperation doesn't keep from feeling guilty knowing that I gave
less to the guy to possibly pay for his babies medicine (200um) than I
paid for the cheese for my dinner (230um). In a country with an infant
mortality rate 10 times the U.S. (73.8 deaths/1,000 live births).

I have been thinking alot about money because I really want to see
some of Africa and I am trying to save. I just have a hard time
enjoying much of anything when there are so many people around with
nothing.

I think this will get better as I understand better what things are
worth. Compassion for me is something that is contextual; the right
action isn't something that can be understood independent of the
environment. Right now I really don't understand my environment so I
really don't know what to do alot of the time.

I suppose though the question of how much to give will always be with
me. It was always with me back home it was just easier to ignore when
the starving Africans were on TV rather than my neighbors.

Love,
Will
