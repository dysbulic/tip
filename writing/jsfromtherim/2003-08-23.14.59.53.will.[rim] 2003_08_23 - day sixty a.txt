Two interesting little occurrences in the last 10 minutes I wanted to 
capture...

There are parties that form here on the weekends, called soirees. I've not 
been to one, but reports are that it is pretty much just a fellow with a 
loudspeaker charging admission to a compound. It is where the bad kids go. 
They don't have drugs or alcohol, but they wear the most shameful outfits. 
Shoulders revealed for all the world to see.

The music draws alot from the same stuff as clubs in the US. A couple
minutes ago "In the Club" by Fifty Cent was playing. Above the primal beat
of "I'm up in the club, pocket full of bubb, I'm into having sex, I'm not
into making love" the DJ comes on hollering, "assillah mellecum." It is 
the general greeting in Islam, and is one of a few phrases which is shared 
between all the languages. He did a good job of getting the tone to fit 
with the song, but the translation is still "peace be with you." =)

"Peace be with you. Are you ready to party?" =)

*-*

Have you ever played with a puppy where it will sort of pounce at you, sit 
for a minute and consider you, then run away to repeat the process? Well, 
replace the puppy with the three week old lamb living in my compound, add 
a little extra bounce and you have the creature which accosts me when I go 
to the bathroom. =)

My usual picture of livestock came from cows which are generally fairly 
uninteresting beasts. I am learning that sheep and goats can have quite a 
bit of personality.

Love,
Will
