I have been in a whiny mood since yesterday, so I am going to tell my 
whiny story. Things aren't bad really; it was just a rough day...

To set the stage let me cover a bit of my condition currently:

About a week ago during center days we did something called "Stage
Olympics" where we all competed in different games and stuff. One of our
events was basketball and holding true to a general lack of good sense I
got out and tried to play wearing my birkenstocks. They, of course,
promptly fell off and I promptly fell down. Not a big problem other than
that I scraped my toes a bit in the process. That wouldn't have even been
worth noticing if I didn't live in a garbage dump wearing sandals all day.  
But, as it is, a couple of my toes turned red and started oozing pus
within a few days despite my best efforts to keep them clean.

The other thing is something that is happening because I am walking on 
sand most of the time. In Nouakchott many of the roads are paved, but 
along the sides are not and often the sand is loose and deep. One thing 
that seems to be happening is that when I step my heel will slide in as 
the sand gives way. This sort of rotates my leg as if I were pointing my 
toes out to the side. The end effect is that I compensate for this 
rotation at my hip and some of the muscles in my groin are pretty sore 
because they don't usually get this much of a workout.

So, diseased toes and sore groin. This is most of the stage for my drama. 
The final bit comes with our visit to the mayor. We finally did get in to 
meet a fellow I am pretty sure was the mayor. (Again, all in French.) When 
we went in though I left my water out in the car and when we came out our 
group split and my water bottle traveled off without me.

So, given the stage of me limping around without water, what would be a
good activity for me? Well, I was feeling pretty tired after the mayor's
office, so I decided to go back to the house where everyone is staying. I
asked Jay how to get there and he told me that it was on the road next to
the Hotel Maharaba and facing the post office. The name of the
neighborhood is Sokojem PS. So I wander out and call a cab. (For the first
time when asked for 300um, I asked for 200um and got it. I was proud of
myself.) I ask him if he knows the L'Hotel Maharaba and he says yes and
then after we start going I ask about the Bureau de Poste and he says yes,
but there's something odd in his tone.

What I learn a couple minutes later is that he thought it was odd is 
because Jay's instructions for across from the Post Office aren't for 
finding the apartment, they are for finding the hotel. So now I am at this 
hotel and I know that the road I want runs beside it, but I don't know 
which way. I don't really have anything to tell the cabbie, so I just get 
out. The guy actually felt bad for me I think because he could tell from 
my questions that I didn't know where I was.

So, I get out and I start walking. I pick a direction that looks good and
I walk about about 3/4mi until I come to the March√© Capital. I think that
it is possible that it is on the other side, but it isn't likely. So, I
limp back down to the hotel. I'm feeling pretty crappy by the time I get
there, so I sit down on a wall and just rest for a bit. The guardian (many
houses have a person who sits outside and watches them called the
guardian) came over to me after a while and offered me a cup of tea. I
thought that was really cool of him.

So, I ask him about the road and the Sokojem. The road I am looking for is
called L'Avenue de Independance and the neighborhood is the Sokojem PS. He
tells me the road running in front of the hotel is the one I am looking
for, but that there are two Sokojems and they lie either direction on the
other road. Great, I have now narrowed it down to all the possibilities.  
=)

(Sokojem is the name of a construction company apparently and the building
they build are called Sokojems and are all over the city. Particular ones
are lettered apparently.)

So, I sit there for a while longer and feel tired and wander off in a
direction I haven't been yet. It isn't a hot day in Nouakchott, only 93 or
94, but I'm starting to turn into jerky. =) I wander into a boutique the
proprietor is friendly, but not very useful for asking directions because
he only speaks Hassinya. I did get a bottle of water from him though.  
Blessedly, I picked the right direction and after a mile or so I start
recognizing the neighborhood and found the apartment shortly thereafter.

At this point I've taken a bit too much sun and a far too little water. My
head is really hurting and I feel dizzy. I come in to the apartment, lie
down and don't get back up until around midnight. (It was 4pm when I got
in.) I felt as bad as I have in a while. I don't usually get headaches,
but I was nursing the mother of them all. After my 8 hour nap I got up for
a bit when the guys came in from dinner. We talked for a bit and played
with our new telephones. Then I went back to sleep and didn't get up until
the next morning.

Today I feel pretty good though. I don't have any serious sunburn and my
head only hurts a little. Still a little low on energy, but moving around
alright.

Love,
Will
