I've been trying to convince Steph to come and see me. The way fares
are right now she can do round trip to Paris for about $400 and
according to people here she can do round trip Paris-Nouakchott in the
$250 range. Once she gets here it is essentially free. =) My monthly
food budget is 30,000um which is $100 on the black market. (You can
trade at the bank, but the rates are lower.)

My mom is doing a Paris trip next June, but it looks like it is going
to be in a different price bracket.

I've been liking the idea of being able to actually show someone from
back home what life here is like. I have heard descriptions from
volunteers of how you go home and there is always going to be a level
of the experience you can't communicate to those around you. I can
already see that. This really is a different world and no quantity of
writing is going to be able to capture the experience.

So, anyway, I've been occasionally reexamining an experience and
thinking "how would Steph react to this?" Last night during dinner my
general though was, "there's no way in hell..." =)

I went to the bank yesterday. I managed to both get my checkbook and
some money. (It was my third attempt.) There is only one place in this
country you can write a check and that is the bank to yourself.
Theoretically you can do it other places, but nobody takes them.

I paid my rent and with my extra money I decided to do a little
shopping. I've not really gotten into the spirit of arguing over the
price of everything, so most of my shopping is just asking the prices
of stuff and deciding it is too expensive. =) I did buy a little
one liter plastic pitcher with some cups.

On the way back I stopped by a boutique and there were random baked
goods: some croissants, loaves and some little semi-circular things.
I'd seen the semi-circular things before, but never tried them, so I
got one.

(There were also something in aluminum balls with Arabic writing on
them. I asked him what they were and he told me "you don't want those.
Those are a 'traditional food.'" I am of course verily intrigued.) =)

I also noticed some eggs and I remembered Jay making hard boiled egg
sandwiches and figured I'd give one a shot.

So, fast forward an hour. I am sitting on my roof wearing only a pair
of basketball shorts. In my new pitcher I have a liter of zreig which
is milk diluted with water and mixed with sugar. I'm eating my mystery
pastry which turned out to be like a deep fried hot pocket. It is alot
of bread with some sort of meat with onions in the middle. For desert
I have a hard boiled egg which has been sitting in that boutique for
God only knows how long.

I tried imagining Steph here. I can get her on the roof. She'd be a
little cleaner probably, but that's manageable. I can put the pitcher
of zreig beside her. The milk was canned evaporated milk and the water
filtered. (I got a filter yesterday to replace the one stolen in the
Ka√©di move.) The zreig is actually kinda tasty if you're careful to
not over dilute the milk. Putting mystery foods in he hands though?
Unlikely. =) She always had too much sense to eat things just because
they didn't smell spoiled. =)

I certainly don't think it would actually be a problem. There's plenty
of non-questionable things to eat. It is just interesting to look at
things from the outside sometimes.

Love,
Will
