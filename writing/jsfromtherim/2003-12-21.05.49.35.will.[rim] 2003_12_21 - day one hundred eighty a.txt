Going to be geeky for a bit, so if you don't like that feel free to
ignore this one.

A reasonable metaphor for an ethernet is a room full of people all
shouting. Everyone hears everyone else, but they just ignore the
people who aren't speaking to them directly.

The thing is that the computers get confused if more than one person
is talking at the same time. When two computers speak at the same time
it is called a collision.

The way ethernet works is that if I notice that I was talking at the
same time as someone else I take a break for a bit and try to give
them time to talk. The other person does something similar and since
we both wait for random amounts of time hopefully we won't start
talking at the same time.

The taking a break though slows down how fast I am talking, so too
many collisions mean a slower network.

There are devices called bridges that act as doors separating groups
of computers. They keep track of who is on each side and only let the
people talk across the bridge when the person they are talking to is on
the other side.

A group of people who could possibly be talking over each other is
called a "collision domain." (In math the "domain" of a function is
the possible things that can be used in it, thus the domain of
possible people involved in a collision is the "collision domain.")

A bridge is said to separate collision domains because it reduces the
number of people who can be talking over each other. There are devices
called switches which are also known as multiport bridges because you
plug several computers into it and it is like each one is behind a
bridge, so it only gets people who are talking directly to it.

The idea is sort of complicated, but really not too hard if you've
been doing networking for a while. Yesterday the guys teaching the
class mangled fairly thoroughly. Most of the time I was content to
let them since arguing isn't a favorite activity of mine and arguing
in French doubly so. At one point though one of the guys said the
blatantly incorrect statement of "bridges don't separate collision
domains, only switches and routers" (and gateways, but since a gateway
is a type of router it was a bit redundant.) I inquired as to "isn't a
switch just a sort of bridge?" He said "yes, but..." and starting
talking about IP broadcasts which is a completely other kettle of
fish.

I gave up as soon as I could tell he wasn't particularly interested in
being wrong. A couple guys in the class though picked up on the
problem though and a half hour of bickering commenced.

I think the whole thing might have been comical if I wasn't so tired.
That and there are people in this class who don't already know this
stuff and the exam ought to be hard enough if they are given the right
information.

Anyhow, I need to figure out why about half of my mail still isn't
going out.

Love,
Will
