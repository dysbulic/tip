I guess I'll start with the final project. I talked to Jason, a current 
PCV, about his and he said that he marked ice cream to a certain village. 
Everything from doing marketing surveys to finding local means of 
production and actually selling some. He wasn't able to break balbastik's 
stranglehold on the market apparently, but it was still quite a bit of 
work.

(It did get me wondering if it would be possible to make something like a 
hand cranked ice cream maker here and maybe make some homemade ice cream 
cheaply. The ingredient I don't think I've seen is evaporated milk. It is 
something to play with later...)

Our final projects were to teach some pretend classes to pretend students 
about computers. Carl and Robert taught Windows, Word and IE. Matt and I 
taught basic computer maintenance. Unfortunately though our schedules kept 
getting messed up and about half of our time for project presentations 
ended up going to other meetings.

I was happy with the one session I did get to do though. I just did 
hardware 101. What the parts in the inside of a computer are and how they 
relate to each other. I went through an analogy to the parts of the human 
body and related each to something. We also had some computers there and I 
left them look inside an old one and a new one to see that the basic parts 
were the same, but that they could look very different.

After I did it the first time for practice they asked me to do it a second 
time for some of the mechanically inclined staff at the bureau and so I 
got to actually teach and it made me feel really good. These were some 
guys who had never seen the inside of a computer before and I got to help 
demystify things for them a bit.

It was an easy teaching experience though because they all understood 
English and I had a translator present as well. It would have been very 
different if I was teaching only in French and had to try and field 
questions on my own.

*-*

Speaking of teaching as well, we learned some more about Cisco. We talked 
to Cisco people in California and Singapore via a conference call about 
our work at the university and the biggest offshoot of the conversation 
was the decision to have us trained as teachers before we start teaching. 

The think is that Nouakchott is not certified to train teachers, so they 
are going to try to upgrade the Nouakchott campus before September. 
Apparently if that falls through we may get shipped off to Dakar, Senegal 
which is the closest certified teacher training location.

One of my biggest goals is to travel and I'd really like getting to stay 
in Dakar for a while. It will be very interesting if my first real month 
in Mauritania as a volunteer isn't in Mauritania. =) I'm trying not to get 
my hopes up too much though. I figure I'll eventually get to see Dakar one 
way or another.

Love,
Will
