I was walking home last night and as I passed a restaurant a guy stopped 
me. I figured somehow this was going to turn into a request for money 
since 95% of the things people talk to me about involve money.

As it turns out he wanted to know if I was Peace Corps. I mentioned a 
long time ago that there was a rape here last year. He told me that he 
was working one night and he saw four guys pull up in a white car, get 
out and pull a screaming white woman into the car with them. He ran over 
toward them but they left before he could reach them.

He said he went and told the police and the next day they came and found 
him. They spent four days driving around the city searching for the car 
and eventually found it. The police sent him away after that and he 
never really heard anything more.

He said he talked to someone who told him the girl was back in town and 
he just wanted to know if she was alright and if anything had been done 
to the perpetrators. I was unfortunately slightly less than no help at 
all since I know nothing.

It was just strange to have the crime placed so vividly for me and to 
see how it has left traces that will be lingering for a while.

Love,
Will
