On the subject of phones, they are something that it is probably best to 
get before coming. I've never owned one myself, but Matt and Carl both 
just got Motrola T190's and they are a midrange phone that they both paid 
20kum for. That'd be around $70. Robert reportedly paid $100 for his 
Erickson T68 which is a very fancy phone that works all over the world.

I really don't know much about phones. I bought Robert's old one (he has 
two at any given time and gets a new one every so often.) I figured that 
with the market being so saturated (there are alot of phone stores and 
like with most other types of stores phone stores only sell phones) and 
the average consumer having so little buying power that prices would be 
low. That doesn't seem really to be the case though.

I could be wrong, but it is seeming like an unlocked world phone would be 
a good purchase to make before coming.

Will
