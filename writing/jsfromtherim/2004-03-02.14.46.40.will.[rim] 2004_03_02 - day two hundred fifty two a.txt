My dear loving Auntie Sharon sent me the 2004 Little Zen desk (or
floor if you live somewhere with no tables) calendar. I've been buying
these calendars for about five years now and really enjoy them. There
have been a couple quotes that have stuck around in my head and I want
to ponder them briefly...

    "In this living world the body I give up and burn would be
      wretched if I thought of myself as anything but firewood."
                                                        -Ryonen

    "It's the opposite of what everyone thinks. They assume
      that when they hang on to the things that matter in this world,
      they are something. But ask yourself: how could anyone who might
      not wake up the next morning be important? If, on the other
      hand, because of your fusion with the Creator you think of
      yourself as nothing, then you are very great indeed  like the
      branch of a tree that realizes it's one with the root. And the
      root is the One without end  the Eyn Sof, the One of Nothing.
      And so the branch is too - it is a No Thing."
                                     -Rabbi Yehiel Michal of Zlotchov

Death is something that has always been important to me. Being
cognizant of the fact that though day to day it may feel as though I
have forever I really am progressing unflaggingly toward death.
There's nothing to be done about it. I see three main possibilities:
ignore it, be depressed about it, or accept it.

For better or worse my dispositions toward truth keep me from ignoring
it. Maybe if I had never really thought about it I could, but as it is
the idea is to live the little bit of life that I have in delusion and
I can't see doing that. As for being depressed I don't really like
that idea either. It seems like if this is what I get then I ought to
try and enjoy it. This leaves trying to accept it.

Living here and both seeing very different conditions of living as
well as having lots of time to both think and read has really started
to concrete this fact of my existence as a cornerstone in my life
philosophy.

I have two major responses to thinking about death in general. On the
one hand it makes me really sad to think that no matter what I do or
how hard I try I am going to pass away. More so simply than that I
will die, but that with a long enough view the affects of my life on
history will weaken to imperceptibility.

The image that comes to mind is a cart rolling along a road toward
someplace out of sight. I see it only for a moment looking up from the
ground as it rolls by and on toward its destination. I am one little
cobble one the road and all of my affects and importance pass in just
a moment.

One the other hand I find the concept both liberating and energizing.
I have just this tiny little span to do anything and everything that I
want to. That means it is important not to waste any time at all. This
isn't an imperative to try and cram as much activity into my life as
possible. When I do too many things it is stressful and the things
aren't as much fun. That is as much a waste as doing too few I think.
It is a call to try and pass my time with as much quality as I can
muster.

For me this plays out the most when facing things I am afraid to do.
Most of my biggest insecurities are about people liking me. Like with
the stuff I wrote about the other day with the speaking French. I was
afraid of doing it because I didn't want my friends to think me weird
and not want to hang out with me. In the end though I did it and when
you dig down into my reasoning, an awareness of my mortality was a big
part of it.

Working on my French and working on expressing my quirks are things
that are important to me in my life. The reasons not to are a fear of
alienating my friends. In the end though me feeling comfortable with
myself is more important to me than if these other people like me or
not. If they like me, cool. If they don't like me, that sucks, but
I've got to live with myself every hour of every day and I'd like that
to be as enjoyable as possible.

Maybe if I had forever to live I would put it off, but I don't.

I am a cobble, but I, along with the other cobbles, make up the road.
Humanity progresses and changes through my life. Everything before has
fed into making the world I live in. What I do will in some way affect
everything that comes after.

I'm just used to being the center of my own play. I experience the
world as a drama with myself in the lead. When someone walks into the
room they come on stage and when they walk out they might as well
cease to exist for all I know. There are millions of plays going on
around me and the process of stepping back and looking at all of them
and how they weave together makes me feel pretty small. It is the
truth though and I think eventually I might get used to it.

It brings to mind the quote:

  "You are a unique and beautiful snowflake; just like everyone else."

I think it is disheartening to me only in that I want to be permanent
and I want to be important. Now all I have to figure out is why I want
those things...

Love,
Will
