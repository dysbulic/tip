So, we are leaving for Kaédi today. We all got up bright and early to get 
over here by 7:30 so we could take an early taxi out of town. Once here we 
learn that since it is Saturday (I don't know if I have mentioned the 
weekend being Friday/Saturday here) most taxis don't run and so the prices 
are higher. So, we are asked to divvy up our bags again.

Here is the divvying so far...

We arrived in Mauritania with all the crap we expected to need. Generally 
three or four bags per person. (Many people did not know that on an 
airline you generally get two checked pieces, an overhead piece and an 
underseat piece, so they didn't bring four.) We were asked to cut that to 
one bag to use during stage. All that went down to Kaédi. Then when we 
came back up to Nouakchott we cut our baggage again to two weeks worth. 
Then going back for center days we cut to as little as possible because 11 
of us rode down in a Land Cruiser. So the bag that I have been living out 
of for the last week is the bag that has been through three cuts. 
Literally it is three pairs of clothes, twenty pairs of underwear (that I 
was carrying to, and finally did, wash this week), a couple French books 
and my trusty laptop.

My other bags were in the main PC office which isn't open on the weekend, 
so it was looking like I was going to be spending the next month with my 
big bag of undies and not many clothes. =) Thankfully, an APCD showed up 
to meet someone and he got into the main bureau and I reclaimed the stuff 
that I dumped for the trip down to Kaédi. I even put on a clean shirt. =)

For now though that stuff stays here along with the undies and 2/3 of the 
clothes. I take one change of clothes and my computer in my backpack today 
because the taxi fare is too high for us to take everything. God willing 
and the creeks don't rise the rest will follow us down in a day or two.

Lucky for me though I was sitting in the front room when they decided to 
send one of us down with an APCD and I got chosen. So I both get a nicer 
ride and I don't leave until noon and get to enjoy a little more working 
internet time.

Love,
Will
