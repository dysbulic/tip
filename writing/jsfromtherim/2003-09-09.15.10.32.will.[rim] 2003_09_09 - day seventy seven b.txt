Before we become volunteers we all have interviews with Katerie, the
Country Director (CD). I had mine last night and it was a pleasant
enough experience. Most of what we talked about was my recent episode
with Wahba.

I used it as an example to illustrate the statement: "I don't want to
be away from home for two years." The gist was that I felt like I was
being treated like a foreigner and I didn't want my life to be
external like that for the next two years. I would really like for
this place to become a home for me.

What she talked about related back to an article I read earlier in the
day. Another trainee got a clipping from the NY Times that told the
story of a West Africa PCV who was stranded several miles away from
anything with a broken bicycle chain. A local happened by and seeing
his plight ended up towing him the many miles back to town. He said
that he was being towed with a rubber strap, so he'd lag behind going
up the hills and then overtake the guy on the way down. =)

That givingness and willingness to help those in need is something I
have heard described here more frequently than I have seen. Right now
though I don't think that means a whole lot since I've also only
gained the ability to have even rudimentary social interactions in the
last week. =)

The idea relates back to the pricing and money here because rich
people apparently actually do pay more. Katerie explained this isn't
just a toubab thing and it isn't considered cheating someone. The
money that I have is mine by the grace of God. Much more so than it is
mine as the fruits of my labor. It happened to me more than I earned
it. =)

I talked a little bit about used car salesmen and how the
stereotypical used car salesman is of a lower ethical class in our
society because he makes his money by trying to get the hard earned
money of others without doing much work himself. It is the emphasis on
work done and a "fair price." Even the usage of the word "fair" has
the suggestion of justice surrounding it.

The emphasis on fortune as opposed to merit as well as the culture of
giving here combine to make it acceptable to receive whatever money is
possible. It is understood and it isn't just something that is done to
foreigners. (It is easier to do to foreigners since they don't know
the correct price.)

She also said that given the age of Wahba what she was doing would
best be interpreted as flirting. That there is the sense of a girl
experimenting with potential suitors to test their affection by
asking for money indirectly.

So, I feel somewhat better. Still not really comfortable that I have
any sort of understanding that I can use to reliably interpret the
events in my life, but I feel like things are moving.

Love,
Will
