Not much going on. I piddled around most of the weekend. I played on the 
computer Friday and then stayed home Saturday and slept quite a bit. 
Obie had everyone over on Thursday night and they played Risk and 
watched movies. It was entertaining.

I found out that everyone will be leaving Nouakchott in the middle of 
November. We will all be going to "conferences" in various parts of the 
country conveniently scheduled for when the elections are taking place. 
=) I honestly don't expect anything major to happen, but I see the point 
in being safe.

Supposedly the people who did the coup a couple months ago have 
threatened to come back in from Algeria if Maaouya (the current 
president) wins which he is pretty much certain to. They had tanks 
before and now they'll have... sand and rocks I guess.

Hopefully I'll be able to get a bike tomorrow. After my period of 
disillusionment about my house after seeing Marc's and Jay's I am 
leaning more toward Matt's cheaper place. The location is better and I 
like the idea of having less to sweep. =) After I get the bike I'm going 
to give it a trial run for a week.

Carl said my landlord came looking for me last week wanting a contract 
signed. It amazes me how slow life is here, but how sometimes people act 
like things are so dire. Hopefully he'll not show back up until I've had 
a chance to try out Matt's.

On the note of food I found a few new things... a place down the hill 
that sells "sandwiches," being pita sort of things with french fries and 
meat and lettuce all rolled up. (200um and pretty tasty.) Another sells 
mountain dew (or so it seems, the writing is Arabic). A grocery near the 
bureau sells Tang, and I bought something like Nestl√© Quik last night. 
So doing pretty well food wise. Need to work more vegetables into my 
diet, but I'm slowing finding things. It is sort of like a scavenger 
hunt living here. There are quite a few things, but it is all spread out 
over many miles.

On the note of gifts. Things it would be cool to have are: a flashing 
red led thing like runners wear to put on the bike I'll hopefully have 
soon. (I'm probably going to get hit regardless given the traffic, but I 
can at least try.) Also, a Little Zen page-a-day, I've been using one I 
had from '98 and it has been entertaining.

Love,
Will
