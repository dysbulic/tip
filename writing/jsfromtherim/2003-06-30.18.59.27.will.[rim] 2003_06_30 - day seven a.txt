Didn't get to write yesterday since most of it was riding down from 
Nouakchott to Kaedi. It was five hours of desert with little villages 
along the way. Maybe a dozen little brick cubes covered with mud.

Once we got in they introduced us to all the staff. Each group has a set 
of language facilitators who will be teaching a local language. The 
tricky part is they are teaching in French. It will be interesting 
learning a third language in a second I hardly understand.

Most people will learn different languages depending on what region they
are working in. For the sorts of things I will be doing, because it will
be business related and in the city, I will likely be using French, or 
maybe Hassiniya which is a dialect of Arabic.

There are four local languages: Hassiniya, Wolof, Pulaar and Sonike. I 
hope to learn more about just who speaks what later.

Once we got settled in we broke into groups and walked around learning how 
to greet in the different languages. All of them start off with "Asillah 
Melecume" (Peace be with you) to which the response is "Melecume Asillah" 
(Peace be with you). Then there is a local part along the lines of "How ya 
doin'?" "Fine."

More chchumba (fish and rice) for lunch and then chicken with french fries 
for supper. It is interesting trying to tear chicken apart with one hand. 
You often have to get someone else to hold it for you so that you can tear 
off some meat. Eating that requires cooperation was another one of those
"the U.S. is so far away" sorts of moments. There is a sort of thick onion 
soup with the chicken and you sop it up with bread that you are allowed to 
hold in your dirty hand, interestingly.

Amazingly, it is raining right now. Really pouring. Kaedi is down by the 
Senegal River and they get more rain during this part of the year. It is 
still just desert and scrub, but currently wet desert.

Well, breakfast is ready and my battery is low, so ttfn.

Love,
Will
