Last night Katerie had everyone over for dinner and drinks. It was very 
nice; in particular there was chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy with 
chocolate cake for desert. I have been pushing for a pig roast when I come 
back home, but more and more I think I just want to go to grandma's house 
for some good southern cooking.

En route to Katerie's I noticed tents going up. It turns out that the 
presidential campaign has been forbidden from starting before now. The 
papers have little articles with lists of people's names saying "we like 
Maaouya, we hope he wins." These are apparently just the precursors.

Last night coming back was a madhouse. There were cars all over the place 
at midnight and usually everything is cleared out by 10ish. Matt tried to 
catch a taxi and the best price he could get is 500um. Usually they are 
300um (it was early in the morning), but Malick said during the elections 
people are all out and about and everyone has extra money.

Walking around today I've seen maybe a dozen tents. Nothing much seems to 
be going on in them, but it has been raining and I suppose they are just 
waiting for it to clear up.

I think the next two weeks are going to be interesting.

Love,
Will

P.S. Did I ever mention "twenty" sounds like the word for "vagina" in 
Hassaniya? Teaching moors to count is entertaining supposedly.
