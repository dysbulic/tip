We are having our first day of consistent rain. No great torrent, just
a steady falling. This day happens to be the day when the PC is coming
to bring us all back to the lyc√©e. I suppose we are both blessed and
cursed to live in interesting times. =) I'd certainly have alot less
to write about if things worked more smoothly.

A few years ago I got "A Little Zen" calendar as a gift. I really
liked it and bought several the next year to give a gifts. You also
get access to the calendar online though when you buy it and I wrote a
program to download the calendar each day and email it to me. When I
was getting it like that I stopped reading it on paper and so I had
most of a calendar for 2002 and I've been using it here. The days of
the week are wrong, but the days of the week are in French here
anyway. =)

There have been a couple in the last few days that I enjoyed and
wanted to share...

"I don't know whether I believe in God or not. I think, really, I'm
 some sort of Buddhist. But the essential thing is to put oneself in a
 frame of mind which is close to that of prayer."
                                                   -Henri Matisse

"Art is frozen Zen."
            -R.H. Blyth

"Nor love they love, nor hate;
    but what thou liv'st,
 Live well, how long or short
    permit to heav'n."
            -John Milton


Love,
Will
