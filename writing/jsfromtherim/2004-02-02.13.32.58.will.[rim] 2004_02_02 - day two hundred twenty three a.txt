Culinary lesson for the night: a clove of garlic and a bulb of garlic 
are decidedly different quantities. Fortunately this was revealed to me 
early enough to leave my refried beans with some semblance of edibility.

It turns out that Carl hadn't the tenacity to attempt to produce 
tortillas from scratch and settled for a type of bread that is called 
pain arabe (Arab bread) here, and is essentially a pita. It certainly 
worked well enough. Carl had a packet of taco seasoning from the states 
and that made all the difference for the ground beef.

All in all it was a pleasant evening. We had a Mauritanian and French 
volunteer visiting so everyone was speaking French for their benefit. I 
like listening to French conversations even if I don't feel confident 
enough speaking to say a whole lot.

I was talking to Matt about a set of French exams that he has been 
working on called the DELF (diplome d'études en langue française) and 
DALF (diplome approfondi de langue française) which are apparently 
roughly equivalent to the TOEFL (test of English as a foreign language). 
He was telling me about having to read an excerpt out loud and then make 
an oral argument about it. The sorts of things that give me a whole new 
appreciation of how much complexity is involved in my everyday speech.

If I can make it through the first exam by the time I am ready to go I 
think I'll be pleased. The first two would be stellar. I've been 
thinking if I had some time to kill it would be really cool if I could 
get a job for a short period of time in France somewhere at the end of 
my service. Matt seemed to think getting the work visa would be really 
tough though.

Love,
Will
