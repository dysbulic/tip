Well, I am back in Kaédi at my host family after a few more center
days. It was really interesting to hear about all the different site
visits. Mine wasn't especially eventful, but several people had
experiences to remember.

Everything in Africa seems to be jumbo sized. Big ass bugs, tons of
sand, rampant poverty, whatever. Things just don't seem to enjoy
moderation here. True to that form when it came time for site visits
it rained 24cm (10in) in 24 hours. Apparently it is the worst rains in
10 years here. You'd think that given all the drought it would be good
to get some rain, but it doesn't work that way. When it hasn't rained
for a long time and it rains like this the ground can't absorb it so
all you get is massive erosion.

It is also not a good thing in places where houses don't have concrete
foundations, the roofs are flat and everything is made of mud. There
were a group of stagiers staying with a volunteer in the Adrar region
for site visit and at about 3:00am the roof came tumbling down on
their house. They had to wade out and eventually found refuge in a
regional PC office.

Another group headed for Salibaby couldn't even make it because the
road was washed out and there was a newly formed river in its
place. They couldn't take the car in because the water was too fast,
so they strung a rope across and the trainees waded to a house where
they spent the night. The next day they waded back across to get some
more clothes and eventually, I think, retreated back to
Kaédi. Selibaby had 600+ structures destroyed by the rain and there
were still 50+ families without a place to live when this story was
being told. This is unfortunate on many levels, one of which is that
it will be next to impossible for the volunteers in Selibaby (there
are three) to find places to live.

The Land Cruisers that the PC drives have little chimneys on the side
running from the engine compartment to the roof. I was told that these
had to do with the air intake. Apparently they work because a
trainee headed to Mbange told of how her group came to a newly formed
lake that there was no clear path around. Her driver simply continued
along the path of least resistance right through the middle. She said
that water was splashing up near the windows, but they made it through
without incident.

This country is mostly sand, and so the wind generally blows it around
till it is all the same height. When it rains then, since the ground
is flat, you don't end up with lakes so much as huge puddles.

Nouakchott only got rain on one day and it really wasn't that bad. The
next day the town was like a steam bath, but I didn't see anything
fall down. After hearing all the stories I almost feel like my life is
too boring. I've not seriously feared for my safety except by getting
myself lost in the middle of the night. I think I need to get out more
and let acts of God endanger me a bit. =)

Kaédi looks nothing like it did a month ago. There are stretches of
grass as you approach the town with herds of plump goats grazing in
them. Supposedly it will be barren sand again in a couple months, but
for a brief span the landscape greens and life springs forth. (95% of
said life being huge insects, but don't let that spoil the magic.) =)

Someone said that volunteers can generally travel within country
without having to take vacation days. You just need to come up with an
excuse to visit someone for "cross sectoral collaboration." I figure
I'm creative enough to come up with come up with something. People
have just described some amazing sounding landscapes and I want to get
to see them.

Love,
Will
