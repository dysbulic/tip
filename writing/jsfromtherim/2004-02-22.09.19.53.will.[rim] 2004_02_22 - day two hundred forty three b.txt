Travel is continually interesting here. I want to write down my travel
itinerary just to capture a feel for how it goes and to have for
reference.

Departure:
 Depart  Arrive 
 Time    Time   City        Place           Transport   Pass.  Cost
  6:35    6:45  Nouakchott  Marc's House    City Taxi    4      125um
  7:00    9:30  Nouakchott  Rosso Garage    Mercedes     4     2500um
 10:30   10:40  Rosso       Ferry Crossing  Pirogue     30      100um
 11:30   17:00  Rosso, SN   Dakar Garage    Taxi Brusse  7     5500cfa
            11:30 - 13:00 Rosso, Senegal - Saint Louis
            13:00 - 16:15 Saint Louis - Dakar City Limits
            16:15 - 17:00 Dakar City Limits - Rosso Garage
 17:10   17:50  Dakar       Rosso Garage    City Taxi    3      500cfa

That gets us down there. Total time: 11.5 hours. Total cost: $20.

All in all things went smoothly. It took us two hours to cross the
border, but that was not too bad.

In Dakar we were staying in a nicer quartier called Mermoz and prices
were generally about 15-20% higher than the price converted to
ouguiya. I suspect though that this is just a function of where we
were.

The center of the softball tournament was the American Club and we had
host families from USAID and the embassy who let us stay for free.
Taxi's were pricier as well, but a big part of this was how big and
congested Dakar is. I had a couple of 1500cfa cab rides that took 45
minutes or more.

Coming back was a little more complicated...

Return:
 Depart  Arrive
 Time    Time   City       Place             Transport   Pass.  Cost
 10:15   10:45  Dakar      DFI Office        City Taxi    3     1000cfa
 16:00   22:00  Dakar      St. Louis Garage  Car Rapide  19     4850cfa
 22:10    0:00  St. Louis  Dakar Garage      Minibus     40       *
  0:10    0:30  ???        Side of Road      City Taxi    3     1000cfa
  8:45    9:00  Rosso, SN  Ferry Crossing    Pirogue     30      500cfa
  9:00   12:00  Rosso      Nouakchott Garage Taxi Brusse  9     1200um

So coming back was about 26 hours, $15. What happened was at least in
part our own fault. When we arrived at the garage we met with someone
who told us that the taxis were no longer running so we would need to
take a bus. We trusted this person who was leading us and that was the
problem. What he did (though we didn't know it) was put us on a bus
for Saint Louis with a deal to get us to Rosso.

After the handoff to a second bus driver in Saint Louis we were
dropped in a town about 15km from Rosso and asked to pay another
3000cfa to get the rest of the way (this was taking place at
midnight). Molly balked and got the price down to 1000cfa. Between the
six hour wait to fill the bus though and the fact that the busses move
about 50% slower than the taxis it was close to 1am when we arrived in
Rosso, Senegal. The port was closed. We were told we could pay an
extra fee (read bribe) of 2000cfa and get our passports stamped and
then get a pirogue to take across illicitly (probably another
5000cfa). We didn't have enough money to do this though and were
fortunately offered shelter by a kind local.

After being dumped in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night
it was nice to have someone show us hospitality. We got up bright and
early and crossed back into Mauritania sweet Mauritania.

It was cheaper coming back than going largely because we bought out a
taxi coming down (three people in the back and one in front of a
Mercedes). Coming back we took a full sept-place (station wagon,
something of a misnomer since it has seven people in it in Senegal,
but ten in Mauritania) which is three in the back, four across the
middle and two up front with the driver.

No big problems though. Having people to travel with and talk to make
it alot easier.

Love,
Will
