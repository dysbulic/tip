This is actually a journal from a long time ago. I wrote this just
after getting back from Chinguetti (over a month ago), but it took me
two weeks before my email was working again. Getting both caught up
and far enough ahead to leave for most of June and still be ready for
the stagiers coming at the end of the month kept me from finding time
to send it.

This one is special on the web because I may well take this trip
again. It is alot of fun if you've got entertaining people to talk to
during the many hours on the road.

We've actually started getting a little traffic from countries in the
south of people wanting to see camels and sand dunes and what-not.

Love,
Will
