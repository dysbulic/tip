Tea is a big thing here as I've mentioned. There is a guy employed by
the university who comes by our class with the requisite three
glasses. The tea here is really strong.

My discovery of the last five minutes is dumping three glasses of the
stuff into a stomach containing nothing but skittles will make a
person feel quite ill.

There is a very good reason that I am not working as a nutrition
volunteer. The fact I've consumed nothing but tea and about a pound of
skittles in the last twelve hours gives a good sense of my dietary
intelligence.

When I woke up at ten today I had to choose between my warm and comfy
blanket with my book and skittles, and hauling my butt out of bed to
go to the bank (which closes at noon) so I'd have money to buy food.
"Carpe diem" I said to myself, though to to untrained observer it may
have sounded like a grunt as I rolled over and fell back asleep. =)

Love,
Will
