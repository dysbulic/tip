I am listening to the cd that Steph sent to me. Very very cool. She really 
is too good to me. It definitely made me feel good. A little sad too, but 
a good sort.

I figured I'd go through my notes from the field while lying here...

Ok, Gardner talks about multiple intelligence theory. That instead of
having a single overriding IQ, different areas of our brains deal with
different aspects of cognition and can be differently developed.  
Specifically, one of his research criteria to declare an intelligence is
that someone can have brain damage that affects only a specific skill set.
If you have ever read about someone one who has a stroke and can no longer 
speak at all, but can read and write perfectly; that is the sort of thing.

There are something like 11 maybe that he claims. An interesting trend is
that so far the people that have et'd I would classify generally as lower
in interpersonal intelligence. My judgment being based on stuff like the
ability to sense the communication needs of other people and to meet them. 
It is very subjective and intuitive, I know, but it is there.

I wonder if maybe I am mapping emotional maturity to interpersonal 
intelligence. Maybe some, that's not all of it though. Anyhow, I noticed 
it and though it was interesting...

Arabic, like Hebrew, is a phonetic language. This is really handy for my 
host father who is trading me some Hassinya and French for English. He can 
write down the words exactly like I say them. Like Hebrew as well though, 
the short vowels between two letters are always the same and omitted. 
This, combined with some phonemes not present in Arabic, mean that he 
can't write some of the words correctly. It is a neat problem.

I personally don't see any reason for anything other than a phonetic 
language. After all, nothing exists in written language that doesn't exist 
in spoken language, so why not have a direct mapping?

And, I still think that gendered nouns are some of the more counter 
-intuitive (and confusing) constructs that exist. The wall is masculine. 
Really? How did you learn this exactly? My penis is feminine. Great. It'll 
be surprised to learn that I'm sure. =) The real fun ones are nouns that 
exist in both genders and have different meanings.

Arabic, btw, has at least different H's. There are several sounds in it 
that Westerners stop making after the age of three.

You know how medical records in the 20's and 30's when there were lots of 
births at home would be imprecise and the actual date of birth may not be 
known? Well, it is like that now here. Except there are not many 
calendars, so people will only know their year roughly. You ask a birthday 
and someone might just know "the year of independence" (1960) or something 
like that.

Goats really do eat anything. They just wander eating garbage: paper, tin 
cans, plastic bags, whatever...

Another trainee told the story of the goat doctor visiting, anesthetizing 
the goat, and removing a 4 kilo plastic tarp from a goat.

Another trainee told the story of seeing a donkey munching on another dead 
donkey. Yum.

I took some shots from the street I like to call "garbage row" replete
with rotting donkey. All the streets have alot of garbage on them, but
this one was singled out for whatever reason to get tons dumped all along
it. Hopefully I will be on the internet somewhere some day and can get
everything up. The format is not very good right now, but I should have
lots of free time to work on it. =)

Wasps. I hate wasps. Steph and I had an incident before I left because 
there was a wasp in the car and she wouldn't stop and let me out. I really 
don't like wasps. I never have, then I got stung in the face and how I 
really don't.

Wasps here, I am not exaggerating are 1"-1.5". They are like ground 
hornets in Tennessee, but fatter around and a little longer. Everything is 
Africa sized.

We walked out to the airport. Before the road was built from Nouakchott it 
was the only way to get here in less that a day. We walked out and by the 
guards with automatic rifles to visit it. It is really big; Habib said the 
airstrip is 2.5km which is about 1.5mi.

While we were out there I noticed that one of the piles of garbage we 
walked by was vials and hypodermic needles. Apparently when the jail of 
hospital needs to get rid of their waste they just find some spot in the 
sand and dump it. Welcome to the RIM.

We did an Islam session and I've got some notes, but they'll wait til 
tomorrow. It is bed time.

Kudos again to Steph for brightening my day. ()

Love,
Will
