We are having a gas shortage. I have not found out why, but outside of
all the gas stations there are huge throngs of cars and people. Your
mind may hearken to the lines during the gas shortages in the early
70's. One must recall that those happened in a country with
discernible traffic laws; this one hasn't.

Another major difference is that most all families owned cars and you
could do things like carpooling to help reduce the need. Most people
here don't have cars and about 50% of the cars on the road are taxis.
Because there is not a whole lot of money in being a taxi driver most
of them put gas in 200 or 400 ouguiya at a time and just fill up
frequently. This makes the "lines" great fun.

I've been hunting for news on-line without much success. I did learn
that the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization is trying to get money
to start spraying pesticides or a "plague" of locusts may sweep out of
Mauritania in the coming months to devastate crops across West Africa.
I suppose I'll go buy myself a paper and practice my French.

And, of course, the obligatory "Mauritania, home of slavery" stories:

Love,
Will

P.S. I just wanted to thank all of you for being here for me (to speak
English to; it is a wonderful language). =)
