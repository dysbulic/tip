I went the other night with Marc to see Freddy vs. Jason at the
theater here. It was my first time in there and it is pretty nice. It
has stadium seating and the chairs are in better shape than in
Cookeville (which isn't saying a whole lot).

I discovered that even when I can't understand anything that is going
on I am still a big wuss. I spent most of the movie with my knees
pulled up to my chest watching the bottom five inches of the screen
under the bill of my baseball cap.

Fortunately the near complete lack of plot made the translation easy.
I didn't understand much of anything said, but Marc could say two
sentences to me and that would generally be sufficient to explain the
plot for twenty minutes. I was generally able to pick out cauchemar
(nightmare), peur (fear) and enfant (child). Somehow those three words
seemed to comprise about 10% of the dialog.

There were only six people who came to see the movie and two of them
got up and left pretty close to the beginning. It managed to have
nudity, promiscuity, substance abuse, violence, profanity and child
mutilation all within the first fifteen minutes or so. Marc was
wondering what exactly Mauritanians think of American life given our
films. It doesn't exactly counter the image of us as an indulgent and
violent people.

It was fun to get to see a movie on a real screen though. Once a week
they do a movie in English. Maybe they'll get a good one in soon.
Watching in French was an entertaining exercise, but I wouldn't have
been able to follow a movie with any real plot.

Love,
Will
