I am in the process of going over the old website and prettying it up
and bringing it in line with newer web publishing practices. It is
going to take a bit, but an interesting page that I discovered is:

  http://mr.pcvs.org/site/family/maite.php

This is a series of articles written by Maite Uranga who was a health
volunteer in Toulde between 2001 and 2003.

I've only read a bit, but her perspective seems to be a decently
realistic one of life here.

Love,
Will

P.S. I had a couple people ask me about pictures after the Halloween
party. I was going to respond that I had a camera and I would make a
point of using it more. Unfortunately I discovered in Chinguetti that
while I did indeed have a camera I don't appear to have a working one.
Uncle Ted has been kind enough to offer and try and get one to me and
I think I'll take him up on it. In the interim, I have managed to make
it on the web in a couple places:

On Miriam's site there's a picture of me with my host brother Omar
from stage: (I got a call from Mousa (my host father) asking about a
letter of invitation when I go home. Amazingly my French gets awful
and I can no longer communicate well when an awkward situation
presents itself.) =)

Carl and I were also captured making our peanut butter sandwiches for
out end of stage luncheon:

She got one where you can see my pretty gregre (charm) that the
Senegalese guy who sold me the tye-dye gave me. Unfortunately the
strap broke and not it is on my keychain and not nearly as cool:

I mentioned drinking with Mark Hitchcock, that was photographed by
Marc Valentin:

I have a couple of photos from Tergit (the oasis coming back from
Chinguetti), but they'll have to wait on a scanner. There are
Halloween pictures somewhere too...
