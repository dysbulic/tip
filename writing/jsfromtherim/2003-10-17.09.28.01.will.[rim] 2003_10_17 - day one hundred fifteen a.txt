We went out last night to a bar / dance club (a "boite nuit" in
French, literally "night box"). It was very entertaining. I must say
that a person hasn't really lived until they've danced to 80's hits
dubbed in Arabic. =)

The music was really cool. There was American club and rap music.
There was Senegalese rap music which has more of a calypso sort of
feel. There was straight up African drumming sorts of stuff. There was
European club techno. Just a whole lot of different sorts of stuff,
but all of it with a good beat.

We didn't get there until around 1am and didn't leave until 3:30. The
particular place we were at is more favored by expats, and so there
were alot of French and Lebanese there. We ran into some army guys who
are in town training the locals on how to defuse mines. (There are
alot of mines along the border with Western Sahara laid by the
guerrillas.)

It was just really neat to get out with everyone. I didn't do much of
this sort of stuff back home and I really like dancing. I am not so
good with the drinking or smoking bit, but people don't seem to mind.

Love,
Will
