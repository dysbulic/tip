Despite all the poop problems I feel pretty good. Last night the ambassador 
came through and we all gathered together to listen to him. He was a PCV 
in Iran years ago and apparently he has a really good relationship with 
the PC here. Something that he talked about that sounded interesting as a 
possibility is getting into foreign service after the PC. There is an exam 
apparently that you take to qualify that is pretty tough. If I am still 
here in two years perhaps I will look into it. Ambassador Will has a nice 
ring to it I think. =)

Just getting to see everyone though really lifted my spirits. It is hard 
not being able to talk to anyone all day. My French is certainly 
improving, but I certainly can't form any relationships of any intellectual 
depth using it.

Speaking of French and poop, when I kept waking up last night I was pretty 
sure that some of my dreams were in French. I have no real idea what was 
being said, but people were speaking French. When I have time and can 
think to myself my French is almost coherent about half the time. Being 
able to understand it coming in and being able to operate at the speed of 
conversation though is another matter.

Definitely though if I were to decide to leave I would not do so until 
after I was speaking French. I think that most of the isolation I am 
feeling now is not being able to talk to anyone. I was talking to Matt 
about intellectual stimulation in a place like Kahedi and I really don't 
know what there is... I'm not going to think about that now though. I make 
it one goal at a time. The short goal for the day is survive the wretched 
pooping sickness and hopefully get some clothes washed. The long term goal 
is learn French. Stuff that comes after that will just have to wait.

My last dream of the morning was aided by four or five women sitting 
outside on the porch in front of my room speaking French and Hassinya with 
each other. I was at the family reunion and I was at the house with mom 
and Libbie and Steph and we were working to get the house cleaned up. They 
were all speaking French though. =) I woke up really missing the mountains 
and the trees, and the feeling of rest and accomplishment that I got after 
working all day at the cabin.

I am accustomed to being very proficient in my environment. I ought to 
have been since I lived at Tech for seven years and Cookeville is not an 
especially big pond. Alot of my self esteem came from that proficiency and 
I wonder how my self concept will adapt to being slightly less useful than 
a 5 year old.

Love,
Will

P.S. Part of the reason I feel better is I visited last night whose living 
situations are much worse than mine and who have been much sicker than I. 
It just gave my some perspective.

P.P.S. I miss you all. ()
