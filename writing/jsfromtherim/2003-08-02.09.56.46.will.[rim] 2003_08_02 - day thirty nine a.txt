I've been sitting in my room all morning playing on the computer. My 
energy has been really low and it has been much more entertaining to try 
and learn tcl than it is to go speak broken French.

I need to get out and talk and be sociable since that is important if I 
want to make contacts, but I really just need a little alone time this 
morning. I've been with people pretty much all the time for the last week. 
Either the other trainees or with the family; being in this situation and 
trying to adapt puts my attention outside myself almost all of the time.

Anyhow, something interesting I just noticed is the phone was ringing and
my host father would repeatedly say "telephone, telephone". I realized 
that he probably can't answer it since he doesn't speak anything other 
than Pulaar and unless the other end happens to speak it as well he can't 
talk.

It really is a very different lifestyle living in a place where just about 
everyone is bilingual at least. Even with my limited comprehension I can 
tell that conversations drift across the boundaries of language as French 
wanders into Hassinya and then into Pulaar.

Love,
Will
