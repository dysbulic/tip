Well, the link I sent earlier was to Stephanie's online journal. It
included a couple of recent entries on our breakup (which happened
about three days ago).

I was more comfortable letting her speak to it than myself since I
feel like I am letting myself off too easily in general. I didn't like
doing it, but I believe it to be the right thing to do.

The entries talking about it though have since disappeared so she was
apparently uncomfortable having everyone read it. I remember one of
the entries and I think it largely characteristic; it was simply the
lyrics to Michelle Branch's "Are you Happy Now?"

I don't have that much to say at this point. For us to break up is
what I think is the right decision in the long run. It isn't a whole
lot of fun at this point, but such is life.

I am leaving for Aioun and Maal tomorrow and ought to be back around
the 21st. Maybe by then I'll have something coherent to say on the
issue. These things just take a little time...

Love,
Will
