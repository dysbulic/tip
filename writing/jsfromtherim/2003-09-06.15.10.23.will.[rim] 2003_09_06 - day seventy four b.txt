So, I go to visit this family and pretty much right off the bat I
break their TV.

We were watching the French channel and I wanted to see if the TV's
here had closed captioning because the people were speaking too
quickly for me to understand. I start looking through the menu, but it
is in Arabic and before I know it I have accidentally told it to
search for channels.

I didn't figure this would be a big deal. I figured it would just find
the same channels it already had, and so I let it run. Lo and behold
though once it completed they were from four clear channels to one
clear one and one fuzzy one.

"Oh shit," thought I. So I managed to get the TV into English and the
way it works is just to scan all the frequencies and find channels.
You can then go back in and fine tune it a bit. Try as I might though
I never did manage to get things to come in better.

If it hadn't correlated so closely with my screwing with the TV I
would have sworn that the antenna was screwed up. As it was thought I
told them that if they had a TV guy come by then I'd pay for him. I
just hope they don't do the usually thing and try to charge me triple
price because of my white skin.

We went wandering off to try and find the repairman and after about
three-quarters mile Wahba (my hostess) talks to some people in
Hassaniya and takes off running. It is literally a hundred degrees and
so I am not in much of a hurry to try and keep up with her. I just
move fast enough to keep her in sight. It turns out that someone told
her the repairman was going to a neighboring village and so she took
off to catch him.

We catch him and she tries for a while to coerce him into coming, but
without success. He agrees to come that evening or the next morning
and we go one from there. He does ask her though if she tried the
search (which I did several times) and seems surprised that it didn't
work. I am honestly curious as to what is wrong with the thing.

So we walked a little bit around the airport (that is where we caught
him). And went back home to sit around for a while more before I came
home. As I was leaving her family brought the TV outside (I don't know
of a family with a TV that doesn't bring it out every night to watch).
They were talking some to her and as she walked me home she told me
that they were complaining that Mauritanian TV was bad (the clear
station) and that they wanted to watch the others. So, she was going
to back to the TV guys house and see if he would come out.

First I can't get my mail to send and now I'm breaking TV's. Maybe it
is the change in the magnetic field or something, but my usual good
relationship with electronical things seems to be going sour.

Love,
Will
