Holy moley. =) I am lying on the floor in my room at my host 
families compound. I got in and they asked me to lie down and rest (I 
think). As I understand it the middle of the day (from like 12-3) is taken 
as sort of a siesta time. I'm not really tired and it is hot as blue 
blazes in here, but I think I am going to hide out for a bit. I'm not 
really uncomfortable, but I can't really talk to anyone and I don't want 
to put anyone out.

My host mom is called Mohma and I met my brothers Admehd and Mohammed. 
Interestingly when I went to shake hands with my host brother he has 
washing and he offered me his wrist instead of his hand.

Walking over here is like walking though a Sally Struthers commercial.  
Part of the difference is just a different architectural style. The
buildings are lower and more spread out. There is a whole lot of garbage
and livestock though that give the air a particular flavor. This is
definitely going to be the source of some interesting stories though; I 
can definitely tell that.

It is not impolite in Mauritanian culture to talk while people are 
sleeping. My family is talking alot outside, but it isn't really loud 
enough to bother me.

Laptop is dying; more later.

Love,
Will
