Happy All Saints Day. I hope everyone enjoyed their vigil. Ours was
entertaining here.

I went over to Jay's in the afternoon and made the punch I mentioned
yesterday. I was able to get most everything other than the ginger and
lemon zest. The really cool part was finding cloves. There is
something autumnal in the taste of them and it was cool to have that
even without any deciduous trees or cold weather. Gave me at least a
sense of the season.

We went over to the home of Miranda at about nightfall. I was
costumeless, but Jay cut out a Maaouya poster and mounted it on
cardboard. So, he was Maaouya for the evening. We were the first ones
there and ended up hanging around for about 45 minutes before other
people started coming in.

Miranda was born in Mauritius, but her mom has been with the American
Embassy here for the last 25 years, so this has been her home for her
whole life. She went to the American School here and if you were
talking to her on the phone you would never suspect that she was not
raised in America. Her English was perfect and the work that she does
is as a freelance translator.

She had alot of food and it was all very tasty. There were also the
three plumpest cats I've seen to date. One even bordered on pudgy. =)

After a bit Schai (I have no idea how to spell his name) from the
Israeli Embassy showed up followed not too much longer by a couple
guys from Westside Oil which is an Australian company doing some
exploratory drilling.

Matt, Carl and Marc followed and they had really gotten into the
Halloween spirit. Carl really went all out. He got hydrogen peroxide
and bleached his hair, then he took some hair from a haircut of
Jessica's and glued it in the middle of his forehead. He was Tin Tin
from the French comic book of the same name. (http://tintin.com) He
had printed a copy of Snowy (Tin Tin's dog) and was carrying it around
with him.

Matt was wearing a dress and Marc had a hippie wig on. They also
brought two French people with them, Jeremy and Lucie, dressed as a
ninja and geisha respectively. After them a few more random French
people came by and an ex-volunteer who works at the Embassy named
Brandy (dressed as a witch) with her Algerian husband.

The party was going on in about half French and half English. I am
going to start in on my tutoring when we get back from the elections.
I could tell I had the worst French in the room. Being able to hang
out in a party where French is being spoken exclusively would be a
really cool skill.

After a while we left to head over to Obie's. Jay and I walked to his
house where he stayed and I picked up my Goblin's Brew. The rest of
them went on over in Jeremy's car. At Obie's we met up with Beth (as
an angel), Racey (as a devil), and Liz (wearing her WAST uniform).

WAST (West African Softball Tournament) is held every year in Senegal
and it is open to various expat groups. There is apparently quite a
bit of debauchery and a little softball involved.

Oh yeah, when all the costumed PCV's showed up I was accused of not
being in spirit and Miranda gave me a American forces desert camo
jacket. So, while walking over to Obie's I was dressed as American
military. The elections still have tons of people out in the street,
so I just had to get comfortable with the idea that if someone wanted
to sideswipe a serviceman there wasn't much I could do about it.

Also at Obie's, we had a Shelagh and Ameserai (her husband), and
Kristen and her boyfriend. We hung out for a bit eating candy corn and
pumpkin candies. My brew went over well which pleased me.

Around midnight we all went back to Miranda's for another hour and a
half or so. All in all my busiest Halloween in a while and a very
enjoyable evening. Last year we had at a pumpkin with a dremel tool
and bought 90 something candy bars. So this was a different sorts of
fun. =)

Love,
Will
