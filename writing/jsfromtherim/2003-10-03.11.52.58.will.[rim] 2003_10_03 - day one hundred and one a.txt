Diversity Visa's are a program by the State Department to increase
diversity in the US. Each year there is a lottery of 50,000 visas
awarded. Last year there were around 9 million applicants. There are
certain educations requirements and you must be from a country that
had fewer than 50,000 immigrants to the US in the previous year.

It is free to register. Maybe I'll tell the people who keep asking me
about visas to try this.

As it is I have just been telling them "if I wanted a visa for
Mauritania would I come talk to you? The embassy is the place to go
for this."

Will
