I'll be honest in saying that this is my first phone and I generally know
diddly about them. It is my understanding though that different networks 
operate at different frequencies and that a "world phone" is also called a 
"tri-band gsm phone". Apparently the US is 1900mhz, Europe is 900mhz and 
Asia is 1800mhz.

I did need to get a SIM to have a phone number.
