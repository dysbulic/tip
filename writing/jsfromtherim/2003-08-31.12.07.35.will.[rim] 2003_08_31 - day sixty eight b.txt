I have been here 65 days and it has rained 4 of them. That means that
there's a 6% chance that it was raining on a given day. I have had my
clothes washed three times and twice it has rained hard the same
day. That means that there's a 66% chance that it will rain on a day
when my clothes are washed.

I've decided to forgo the computer stuff and what-not and simply
travel Mauritania having my clothes washed. I plan on using God's
apparent enjoyment of wetting my laundry to turn this country into a
fertile jungle. =)

And if I didn't mention, after a rain this country is a giant
sauna. They don't even take the shrimp to a restaurant in Nouakchott,
they just wave them in the air for a bit and they're steamed. It's
only 90 right now, but I can't lean over the computer because I keep
dripping sweat onto it. Yuck.

*-*

Steph told me that my shit banana joke got lost somewhere in the
ether. I've been screwing with my mail so much over the last couple
days that there's no telling where it went.

I was just commenting that having a significant other back in the
States was definitely the way to go if doing something like this. It
is really great to have someone to talk with and email with and to
send you packages and all that. Also, when you run out of deodorant
it's nice to not have to care that you are ripening like a banana made
of shit. =)

I had heard in the past about the hygienic practices in Europe and that
in particular deodorant was a more American penchant. I have found
that to hold true here to the extent that I don't think I can even buy
deodorant in Ka√©di. I found a boutique with good soap and one with
Colgate, but other than some colognes to cover the stink not much in
the deodorant department.

I'm almost certain that I'll be able to find something in Nouakchott,
but for now I'm pretty content just being a little funky. I noticed a
certain inner glow to the volunteers when I arrived and I'm now
learning that glow can just as easily come from without. =)

Love,
Will
