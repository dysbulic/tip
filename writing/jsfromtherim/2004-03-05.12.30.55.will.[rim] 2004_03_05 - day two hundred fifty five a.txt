I've actually been working today. The invitations for next years Stage
are going out and some stuff that would be useful for that group like
the map showing everyone's location I broke a while back and never
fixed. So, I've been putting that stuff together.

By far the most irreverent thing we've put together for them is the
"Studs of Mauritania" collection that we did with pictures from before
WAIST when everyone was at least marginally bemustached. It is a set
of personalities ascribed to our "mustache names."

  http://studs.mr.pcvs.org/

People with delicate sensibilities should be warned that I take
irreverence as an art.

As I was wandering the web hunting for inspiration to write some of
the ads I checked out the yahoo personals. It turns out that there are
five girls professing to be buddhist/taoist within 250 miles of Bluff
City, TN and 63 guys. Damn my heterosexuality. Not that the religion
matters to me; I just am curious what it would be like to spend time
with someone philosophically similar to myself.

*-*

Another interesting thing not mentioned on the front page of the
website is a video for the ketab song. "Ketab" in Hassaniya means
"book" and this is a song composed by the top Mauritanian musicians to
promote literacy. It was released a little bit before I got here in
sync with the passage of compulsory elementary education.

  http://mr.pcvs.org/ketab.mpeg

Many things here belong to the "if a little is good then more is
better" school. While I was in Aioun I heard a music store begin
playing this song at 8am and played it in a loop for a good ten hours
(literally).

Most of our music in the States is harmonic meaning you have chords
based on an eight note scale (an octave). Here it is mostly modal
meaning you have mostly individual notes and if I remember correctly
the scale is five notes. I wouldn't have guessed it when the day
began, but into the fourth or fifth hour the music started to grow on
me and I found myself singing along. (Or pretending since I don't
speak a lick of Hassaniya.)

*-*

On the subject of music I would like to recommend MC Solaar to those
working on learning French. It is not easy for those unaccustomed to
hearing it, but if you look up the lyrics and get to a point where you
can sing along it is entertaining.

Two of my favorites are "Le bien, le mal" and "La belle et le bad
boy." Both of them have some English which helps. =) Solaar has also
done a couple collaborations with American artists including a version
of "All 'n my grill" with Missy Elliott.

I still don't understand 90% of it, since it is about as intelligible
as American rap, but it is good practice.

Love,
Will
