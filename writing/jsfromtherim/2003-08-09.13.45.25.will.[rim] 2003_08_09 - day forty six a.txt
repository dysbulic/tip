I don't have the time to hook up my laptop and write very much, but I just 
wanted to give a little mental and physical checkin.

Matt and I walked many miles today and I found a place that I really like 
in Taverak-Zeina. I was thinking I would live in the Cinquieme or Sixeme 
(fifth or sixth) quarters because it is pretty cheap there, but I visited 
a house today right between (literally within a hundred yards of) the 
houses of Obie (my APCD) and Katerie (the country director (CD.)) It is a 
nice place, but because there are 5 people living there (I think it is a 4 
bedroom place) the individual price isn't too bad. Med (the guy who was 
our host there) said it would be 12kum and 2-4kum for utilities.

There is a question of whether I can live there or not since the other 
guys aren't Mauritanian. I think there are two Liberians, someone from the 
Ivory Coast and a Gambian. Also, there is another person there whose place 
I will theoretically take, but as of now when exactly he will leave is up 
in the air. Med said he'd put me up with his brothers (who share a room 
currently) until the guy leaves. I'm cool with being uncomfortable for a 
bit if it means a cool place afterward.

The only other thing is it is several miles from the university and so I'd 
have to ride a bike. I've only lost about 20lbs so far (did I mention 
that?) so I figure to really get into the Africa look I've got another 20 
to go at least. =) It isn't cool though, because at least half my 
weightloss is muscle mass from not getting enough protein and not 
exercising at all. Things will change though, so I am leaving it for after 
stage.

Mentally, Steph said something that helped clarify stuff for me a bit (I'm 
on YIM occasionally as dysbuliac.) She asked me if my lack of 
communication was depression related. It doesn't feel like it really, but 
I'd say that this funk is what would have passed for a depression a few 
years ago. I think that my practice has just made it a little easier to 
deal with.

The spending time on the computer is just a way really to spend time alone 
and collect myself from being so externally focused. The outside of my 
head if just so daunting right now and the inside of my head isn't much 
better because it is becoming automatic to try and translate all of my 
thoughts into French.

I sat this morning for 20 minutes and did a little yoga afterward. Helped 
settle me a bit. Going out into all the French was still hard though. =) 
I've been working on a letter to Steph in French since the last mail call 
had both stickers from her and a very nice note from Andrew. I thought 
that I'd encourage them both with letters in return. I figure the French 
will just make things a bit more diffic... interesting.

I realized last night that where I am now is too public. I need a little
space to get away from all the French at times. The new place looks like
just the answer I was looking for. Mashallah.

Anyhow, the volunteers are going out to eat and since I've not been out 
with them yet I figure I'll splurge and be sociable.

Feeling better. Sort of precarious, but better. =)

Love,
Will
