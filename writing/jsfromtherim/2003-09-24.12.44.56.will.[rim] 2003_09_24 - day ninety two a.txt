I have a new word. Velanci(ya) this is "French (wo)man." This is also
what they call me when I'm walking around the market. (That and
toubab.) Another option is nesrani(ya), literally "(wo)man from
Nazareth" (Christian), but it is a general term for "white person."

I went to the Marché Socim yesterday evening and it is out of the
"expait" part of town, so I didn't see any non-local looking people
other than one Chinese woman.

A note to be followed up... Across from the UNDP there are a bunch of
mosquito nets set up with Korean? people living in them. Supposedly
they came here to go in on some joint venture with Mauritanians and
they were ripped off. Now they have been living outside the UN either
in protest or in petition of money to go home.

Another thing to follow up... I was walking the other night and in the
sky there was a huge line of bats. It went out of my sight in both
directions; thousands and thousands of bats. Following the bats back
to their home is on my list now.

Anyway, on the subject of the marché... Assuming I can find the
equipment and necessary savoir faire to cook there is quite a
selection here. Lots of different grains and pastas, some dried spices
and quite a few unidentifiable things. The selection isn't bad, if you
took a grocery store, took out everything that can spoil, take out
everything expensive, take out and multiple vendors or a given product
you are getting close to the Marché Socim. There are some veggies and
potatoes too.

Oh yeah, and in typical Mauritanian style, for each thing sold there
are ten identical vendors all right next to each other. It is surreal
almost how this works. Have I mentioned the place where you buy
oscillating fans? Eight shops in a row, each sells three things and
only three things. You can choose between oscillating fans, assorted
luggage or boubous. I need to take a picture because you'd think I was
making this up for effect. =)

I didn't buy anything other than a little package of cheese. My dinner
was a tasty cheese and strawberry jam sandwich. =) I have a lead on a
restaurant near my place that serves ceeb u jen (the spelling from the
PC Mauritania cookbook). I'm hoping it will be cheap enough to make it
onto the menu at least a couple times a week. The food budget is aimed
for around 1000um a day, but I'll have to work at it.

Last night was:
  230um package cheese (4/8 pieces consumed)
  300um jar strawberry jam (1/10 jar consumed)
  40um  loaf of bread
  40um  2x 20um roll

So that was a 180um + 30um + 80um = 300um dinner and it was just bread
and cheese. Breakfast is usually a loaf of bread with jam. I'm hoping
to add a little coffee or something in there soon. Need a stove first.
=) It is just so easy to nickel and dime my money away. I just can't
spend over my stipend and I'd really love to save enough to see some
Africa.

Well, I suppose time will tell. =)

Love,
Will
