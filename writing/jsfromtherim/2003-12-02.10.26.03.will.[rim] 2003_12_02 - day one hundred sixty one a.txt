Amber used to discuss a medical dilemma when I lived at Third and
Denton. I was talking to someone last night and they told me that
during their stage someone (now E.T.ed) actually had to make this
decision.

He was getting ready to go to class and they saw that his family
had the cutting board out as well as the knife and the axe. It looked
like they were getting ready to do some serious cooking, so he asked
what was for lunch. They told him that they weren't going to cook they
were getting ready to circumcise their baby girl.

Of course there ensued a discussion where the volunteer tried to stop
the family explaining all the reasons why this is a bad idea. He
apparently got back the general "you're American, you don't
understand, this is what we do here."

I don't agree with the practice, but it is true that we are foreigners
here. I don't think it invalidates our opinions, but it certainly does
change how the locals perceive them.

To understand the implications of this beyond the general stigma
surrounding female circumcision you need to have some idea of how
tools are used here. Back home we had the knife drawer replete with
steak knives for eating, a paring knife for making tomato florets,
maybe a bread knife and of course some butter knives along with a host
of other knives. Here there is a knife. This knife does all the
usually knifely duties as well as a variety of others. The knife is a
can opener and a shovel and an axe; the possibilities are limited only
by imagination of the wielder.

As you would imagine this knife is about as far from surgical steel as
you can get.

The dilemma of the volunteer is. Given I can't stop this from
happening, do I go and try to find them the proper tools (and thereby
aid the process) or do I completely remove myself from it and greatly
increase the girls chances of dying from an infection.

It is a damned hard decision to be faced with. I hope to not be
presented with the likes anytime soon. What would you do?

Love,
Will
