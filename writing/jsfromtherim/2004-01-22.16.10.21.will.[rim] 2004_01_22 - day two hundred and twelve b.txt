Ok, relationship. What was it and why isn't it now... I am still
pretty sick and so this may be a bit muted since I feel like I was hit
by a truck, but I want to get it written out.

Backstory for those unfamiliar: Stephanie Horne and I dated from July
8, 1998 to January 6, 2004. Those four and a half years are far too
complex to codify simply, in no small part because we both did alot of
growing and changing in that time.

My biggest changes were probably in the areas of self-esteem and
professional identity. I learned quite a bit about the experience of
emotion from Steph in particular. For her part her self-confidence
increased quite a bit and she picked up some of detachment.

We lived together between when she moved to Huntsville in the the
winter of 2000 until I left for Mauritania in summer 2003. We have
since been keeping in fairly regular contact via email.

I suppose the obvious question is "what changed?" We obviously decided
to give an international relationship a try and so why have I decided
at this point to break things off.

There were two main things. The first was the planning of an upcoming
trip to Paris. It was not to trip itself, but just that the trip will
fall at about one year into my service. It served to mark the abstract
concept of two years passing and help me to see that time is picking
up for me faster and faster and I will be at the end of two years
before I know it.

The crucial question for the last two years has been marriage. I want
to have kids and I want to be married before I do. I'd like to stay
married for at least 20 years to get those kids raised. Ideally I'll
be with this person for the rest of my life.

I plan on traveling some at the end of my service. I expect that by
the time I get home I will be very close to seven years with Steph.
Seven years, two and a half of them long distance, require a marriage
proposal in my book. I know that marriage is important to both of us
and I don't think it would be at all fair to have her wait if I was
certain that I wasn't going to get married.

I have known about my uncertainty for a while. In Huntsville it was a
really big issue for me. This relationship is the first big one for
me. It is the first one where I got over being amazed that I was
dating and really started getting into knowing the other person.

All in all I really liked what I found in Steph and what we had
together. It was not how I had imagined it would be though and I
didn't know why. I have been hanging out for the last couple years
hoping that I would change into the sort of person who relies on
feelings. Stephanie knew well what to do enough based on how she felt.
I wanted to be like that.

The second thing that happened was me spending time with girls. One
girl in particular was just very different from almost anyone I had
known and it left me wondering what it would be like to date her. (She
is involved in a long term relationship herself and I won't date her,
but it was the question that was important.) As I thought more about
it I could see that my doubts and uncertainties about marriage have
stayed pretty much the same for the last two years.

The information that I need to know is that the relationships I would
be giving up getting married are less fulfilling that the one I have.
I had hoped to find this knowledge internally somewhere, but to no
avail. I said in Huntsville that I thought we would have to break up
before getting married. I decided about a month ago that was pretty
certainly true.

I didn't decide that I didn't want to get married. I decided I didn't
know and what we are doing now is not teaching me. That means I am
settings things up either for her to eventually get sick of it and
dump me or for me to break up with her in 2005. Neither of those was
preferable to doing what I knew needed to be done.

I didn't push the subject either for myself or her. I was pretty sure
the decision I would come to if forced to make it, but didn't actually
make the decision (if that makes sense). Right before Christmas just
seemed a rotten time to end a relationship. I wanted her to have time
with her family and to enjoy it.

So now we are broken up. It has been rougher on her than on me for a
couple of reasons. She was always more open to emotional experiences
and that gave depth to her suffering. I also don't think that she
really believes that I am doing this for the reasons I claim and her
reasons are meaner and more vengeful (baser at the least).

>From here who knows what the future holds. We will not date again
unless we plan on getting married. Maybe she will find someone who is
sweeter to her. I have long though that she needed such a guy and if
she finds him it would be petty to fault her that.

(I just realized I don't think she ever told me a sort of girl I might
find that would make me happier than her and I think that speaks a
volume as to the differences in how we loved.)

I don't have anyone here I especially want to date. There are people
with individual characteristics that entertain me, but I'm pretty
picky all in all. I suppose some time on my own would do me some
good...

Love,
Will
