Carl is back in town from Nouadhibou and has been spending the last 
couple nights at my place. A couple night ago we went out and got a 
burger with Jay and Marc. I am really enjoying the company of these guys 
and I think they are going to make good sitemates for the next two years.

Before we went out to eat we went over to Marc's place and after we went 
over to Jay's. It was my fist time seeing both and I was duly impressed. 
  They are both paying 50k, and I think they are both getting their 
money's worth. Marc's place is so fresh it shines and Jay's has a really 
nice layout. He has two guest rooms and a living room with extra 
matelas. It is easy to tell he is well prepared for the influx of people 
from the countryside that is sure to happen once things settle down.

I actually sort of felt sad seeing their places. I've really been liking 
Rhonda's and have been getting acclimated and have been cleaning the 
place up a bit. I was proud of how it was looking until I saw these 
places that I'd never be able to compete with unless I spent alot of money.

Just in appliances; Marc and Jay both have refrigerators which is a 40k 
investment up front and then 6-8k each month for the electricity. Cold 
water is certainly nice, but I couldn't have one of those unless I give 
up on my dreams of saving some to travel.

And the thing is that I really don't want to live like that. 99% of 
Mauritanians don't live like that and while I don't fault Jay and Marc 
for their lifestyles I am wanting to try and break myself of having so 
many creature comforts. Ka√®di did a really good job of separating me 
from the lifestyle I was used to, but it is really easy to just fall 
back into it.

Pretty soon hopefully they will repair the air conditioner here and will 
start having things for me to do. When that happens I'll hopefully spend 
less and less time over at the bureau and in Taverik-Zeina. It is a 
really nice place, but it is a transplanted bit of Europe rather than 
Mauritania.

I just figure as long as I'm here it seems like I should really get to 
know the local life rather than just bringing my existing lifestyle with 
me. Also it definitely won't hurt me to learn to get along without so 
much crap. =)

Love,
Will
