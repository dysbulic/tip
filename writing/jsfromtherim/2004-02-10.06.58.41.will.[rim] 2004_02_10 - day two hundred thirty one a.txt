I've not been very good about writing in the last little bit. Part of
it is being busy and part of it I think is just some time spent
thinking.

Things have not stopped progressing though. We have finally started in
with a class. I am aiding in a section of the third semester. We have
done two courses in the last two days. Our first day was a bit rough
because of some technical problems, but last night Malick and I
actually started teaching a bit.

We were just doing a review of previous stuff, so we had a couple of
routers and two groups trying to configure them and get them talking
to each other.

The management of computer programmers has been likened to herding
cats. I must say that managing a classroom in Mauritania is much the
same except perhaps that the cats are all stoned. Things are more
docile, but people are more apt to wander.

Our current class has supposedly twenty people signed up. Around
twelve seem to be showing up. We go from 6-8:30pm. One interesting
thing last night was 8:30 arrived and we were still trying to figure
out what was the matter with our configuration. Most everyone left as
soon as the clock hit 8:30, but two guys from the university as well
as an American working with an NGO stayed. These are three of the
strongest students in the class and I think it is because of their
interest.

The one downside to having strong students is that listening doesn't
seem to be an especially highly valued characteristic culturally here.
That combined with my inability to communicate in French makes
teaching a bit of a challenge. It was a bit vindictive, but when
someone wasn't listening I would just hold back and let them flounder
for a while with everyone watching. That seemed to make them quicker
to listen to me telling them how to do things. =)

Things are definitely rough at this point:
  I speak garbled Franglais
  I don't really know all the Cisco specific stuff we are teaching
  I was very likely the youngest person in the room last night
  we are supposed to have an enrollment of 25% women for the UN
    funding requirements and I have so far seen one woman

Maugre this I can see where things can come together. Inshallah.

Love,
Will
