I'm sitting in a little cyber cafe in Saint Louis right now. This town is 
really proving to be interesting. It has African towns to either side on 
the mainland, but the island is essentially a little French colony. We 
were out last night and the place feels a whole lot like New Orleans. At 
least it feels a whole lot like New Orleans to me who has been living in 
Nouakchott for the last six months, your mileage may well vary.

The way the city is set up is you come down along the Senegal river from
Mauritania. You run into a city which looks quite a bit like a Mauritanian
village. A little more color and a little better concrete.  Then you cross
over a bridge that was supposedly designed by Eiffel and imported from
Germany or somewhere. Once you are on the island you are in the colonial 
capitol and it has a definite French feel to it. A little run down, but 
nice enough that I think most of you would enjoy it. Then on the other 
side of the island you have a peninsula that is about 300-500 yards 
across. There is a Wolof fisherman's village there and about two miles down 
is our hotel.

Our hotel is a little place on the beach and is very pretty. We have a
hotel room where we are putting all out baggage and then we have a two big
tents out on the beach with about ten people per tent. The cost ends up
being 4500cfa ($7.50) (cfa = central African franc and 1000cfa = 1750um =
$1.75) a night. Not a bad deal for a very sweet hotel.

So far I've just been doing vacation sorts of things. Little bit of 
shopping in the market, little bit of going out to eat, little bit of 
going to clubs... I went with Andy last night to a casino. In Vegas there 
are laws about how much the slots have to pay out on average. Here, not so 
much... He went through 10000cfa in about half an hour. That's quite a few 
ice cream cones (or beers depending on your tastes). It was entertaining 
to watch though.

We have about twenty people in town and we are expecting another ten 
tonight. We should have a big enough group to get the party going 
wherever we end up.

Well, my time is about up. I am going to go and try and find the museum 
that is rumored to exist somewhere and a merguez sandwich (I have no idea 
what merguez is other than it is meat and all the places I ask for it 
don't have it).

Love,
Will
