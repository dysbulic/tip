I think I've mentioning "guardians" before. They are someone who you
pay to sit outside you apartment and holler if they see someone trying
to break in. Generally they make 20-25,000um a month ($66-$83). That's
a fairly normal wage from what I understand. I heard that a day
laborer generally makes 500um ($1.75) and a skilled laborer like a
carpenter makes 1000um ($3.50).

Matt was talking with one of our facilitators who teaches English when
he's not doing PC. He said doing tutoring in Nouakchott his pay is
something like what he makes (100,000 um a month). A really big part
of ours is just rent. Finding a place for less than 40,000 um a month
is really hard. Finding one that the PC considers safe enough to live
in I think is impossible except through extreme good fortune.
Literally half the people in the country live here and there's just
not enough houses for them. They're pressuring us now to find stuff
because all the university students will be coming in soon.

I was talking with Steph about having found a Twix and wanting to eat
them often (being a consumate chocolate lover). She asked how much
they are and I said 250um ($.83). You can't think of it as dollars
though. That would be all well and good if I was making an American
salary, but I'm making a (good) Mauritanian salary. After housing I
have probably 1000um a day to eat.

Let's say back home I was making $6.50 an hour. That'd be $260 a week
or $1040 a month. Let's say I spend $340 on housing that leaves me
with $700 or about $22 a day to eat. The 250um candy bar is 1/4 of my
money for the day, so it is really a $5.50 candy bar so far as I am
concerned.

*-*

Anyway, I'm getting distracted. I meant to talk briefly about
guardians, or rather guards. The government buildings don't have
guardians, they have guards. The difference being guardians could yell
or hit you with their fists; the guards could shoot you with their
assault rifles. =)

My walk between my house and the university takes me by probably five
different building with guards. The expected response ranges from the
fellows guarding the presidents lawn (which is huge and I don't come
within half a mile of the "grey house," but there are guards along all
the fence) who just look intimidating. To the fellows guarding the
National Guard right down the street from me who make everyone cross
the street to pass in front of their place. There's one place where I
don't have to go all the way across the street, but I do have to sort
of wander about three feet out into the street.

All in all I think it's a bit silly since if I were going to lay siege
to the National Guard I figure I could at least find a car to crash
into something. I'm willing to play along though. The only reason it
is irritating is the traffic here is really bad and completely without
rules. Crossing the street is something I like to do as rarely as
possible.

I was walking by a traffic jam on one side of a divided highway
yesterday and people would just cross over and drive the wrong
direction. I'm pretty sure that there's no such thing as a traffic
ticket here.

Love,
Will
