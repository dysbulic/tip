We are all back at the lycee for some "center days". The ICT volunteers 
will be traveling off to Noakchott on Sunday for two weeks, so this is our 
last chance to see everyone for a while. Things have been pretty busy for 
a while and I've not gotten to write much. A routine is really setting in 
though, so there's not as much to say.

Perhaps the most interesting thing is that Pat is leaving. I'm not sure 
quite how to put it, but it has been interesting to date that the trainees 
that have been leaving have been the less socially adept ones. Pat though 
is decidedly not. He is one of the funniest people that I been around 
before. Nearly always on. If you can imagine what staying around Robin 
Williams would be like; that is what I think being around Pat is like.

Pat has been very sick though. He went about two weeks either puking or 
immediately crapping out every meal. He is hoping to get a transfer (which 
is uncommon, but possible) and I think as much as anything it is a 
testament to his fortitude that he lasted two weeks. Out of all the ET's 
his I completely sympathize with.

Cat is visiting and she would like to share with the world the sheer 
amount of creatures that procreate publicly in Mauritania. Goats, 
sheep, cats, and flies galore. =) Something is wrong when the animals are 
outdoing the humans in love-making. And a lack of either good food or good 
music bespeaks a unfortunate state of affairs in a place.

That puts at 9 ET's. The last group only lost two during stage apparently.

I got mail from Steph today. It really made me feel good to have a little 
something when mail call came around. For only $1.30, less than the cost 
of a good cup of coffee, you too can make Will feel loved:

Will Holcomb
Corps de la Paix
B.P. 222
Nouakchott, Mauritania
West Africa

I have some more notes, but I see my assistant peace corps director (APCD)
chatting with the other ICT's and want to see what's up.

Love,
Will

P.S. If you know anyone who wants on here just have them send mail to 
jsfromtherim-request@himinbi.org with the subject "subscribe".
