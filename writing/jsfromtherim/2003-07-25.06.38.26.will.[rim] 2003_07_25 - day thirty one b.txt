Yesterday we went to visit the university and the Cisco Academy. This was 
a particularly interesting visit for Matt and I since this is where we 
will be stationed.

Cisco, for the unfamiliar, is a maker of network infrastructure equipment. 
The things that generally help computers talk to each other. One of their 
biggest areas is routers, which are the things that route internet traffic 
to the right places.

The Cisco Academy works in conjunction with the University and the 
government to train people in network topology design using Cisco 
products. Matt and I will be working with the academy apparently teaching 
classes. The interesting thing about this is that neither Matt nor I has 
any experience at all with Cisco products. =)

They have a bunch of documentation though in English and some routers to 
play with, so I don't expect it to be very hard to get up to speed. I 
actually like the idea of getting to learn it and getting to teach is 
something I am really interested in as well.

Of course I will be teaching in French, so we'll have to see how that 
goes. =)

There are two other nice things I learned. We saw the room where we will
have our office and we will have access to a network there, so hopefully
my email reliability will be increasing in September when I go to work.
Inshallah.

The other comes from a Russian expat (the term for an ex-patriot, which I
am pretty sure is someone living in a country with citizenship somewhere
else. It generally seems to be used for someone who wasn't raised in
Mauritania. It sounds better than tubab ("too-bob") which is the term
(Wolof maybe) for foreigner used by children when they chant at us.)  
Anyhow, she said that most of the students are home for the summer, so
right now we have a pretty good chance of finding a place to live. I
noticed some buildings near the University and I am going to start my
search there.

Love,
Will
