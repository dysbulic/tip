Jesus H. Christ the flies. There are literally flies around like I have 
never seen outside of a garbage dump. Flies crawling on me and the laptop 
and the walls and the floor and every other surface in the room. A whole 
fly society in this room replete with little fly love stories and combat 
to the death.

One of the screens in my window is missing and I am pretty sure it is 
through this hole that the flies are gaining entrance. When my French gets 
a little better I am going to ask if I can patch it up.

Habib came by last night and visited. I asked him for a place to plug up 
my laptop and he asked them to put an outlet in my room. I wasn't looking 
for something quite that convenient, but I'm certainly not complaining. =)

When I was getting ready to come I didn't get the mosquito net recommended 
by the PC, a self-standing one because I figured I'd be in a more urban 
setting and not need it. It turns out that it is pretty common to sleep 
outside at night because it gets so hot inside. Even when we were in 
Nouakchott guys were sleeping outside on the ground. (Though, again,
cities here are very spread out, so it isn't like sleeping out in an 
urban area in the States.

I also got my Mauritanian name yesterday. I am called Ehdrise, or Eddi for
short. This is the same name as the youngest son (I am guessing around 6
months).  Ehdrise is apparently a prophet in Islam. I don't know much more
than that.

Love,
Will
