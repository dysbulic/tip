I got this most thorough and illuminating message on the subject of
halawa and thought that you should all be as enlightened on the
subject as I now am. =)

Love,
Will

> I'm wondering what exactly I ate. =)

Apparently another English spelling is "halva." Here's are some
excerpts from the entry on "halva" from one of my favorite books, the
Oxford Companion to Food.

Halva: the name of a hugely varied range of confections made in the
Middle East, C. Asia, and India, derived from the Arabic root hulw,
"sweet."

In 7th-century Arabia, the word meant a paste of dates kneaded with
milk. By the 9th century, possibly by assimilating the ancient Persian
sweetmeat afroshag, it had acquired the meaning of wheat flower or
semolina, cooked by frying or toasting and worked into a more or less
stiff paste with a sweetening agent such as sugar syrup, date syrup,
grape syrup, or honey by stirring the mass together over a gentle
heat. Usually a flavouring was added such as nuts, rosewater, or
pur√©ed cooked carrots (still a popular flavouring). The finished
sweetmeat could be cut into bars of moulded into fanciful shapes such
as fish.

Halva spread both eastwards and westwards, with the result that it is
made with a wide variety of ingredients, methods, and flavourings.

...

Semolina halva is the usual type in the Middle East, where it is
diversified by the addition of nuts, dried fruits, coconut, yoghurt,
honey, and spices and other flavourings. Some Turkish and Greek
halvas, however, are made without grain and derive their texture from
the combination of cooked egg (yolk or white) and solidified syrup.
Nuts are always included, whether whole, chopped, or ground, and
sometimes dried or candied fruit.

The halva best known in Europe and N. America is another non-grain
type, sesame halva. This is a by-product of sesame oil production,
made by grinding the solid remains of the sesame seeds finely,
sweetening them with sugar syrup or honey, and pressing the mixture
into a solid cake. Sometimes it is embellished with whole almonds or
pistachios.

Between the Levantine sesame confections and the Indian vegetable
pastes lie a rich variety of halva recipes from Syria, Iraq, Iran,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and C. Asia. Halawat tamr, an Iraqi sweetmeat,
is a mixture of dates, almonds, and walnuts, chopped and kneaded
together. A Syrian version of semolina halva, called ma'mounia, is a
specialty of Aleppo, where it is a popular breakfast dish. Basbousa is
the name given to sa similar dish made in Egypt. Karachi halva, made
from sugar syrup, cornflour, and ghee, produces a result a little like
Turkish delight. To western palates, almond versions of halva such as
halawah bil loz, made in Iraq, are reminiscent of marzipan.
