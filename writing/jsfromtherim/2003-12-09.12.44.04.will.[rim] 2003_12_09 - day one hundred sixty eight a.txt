I realized it has been a couple of days since I last said anything, so
I figured I'd speak a bit. I wrote a bit the other night but got
interrupted and it'll be along shortly.

Things have been really busy here. I spent the first half of today
getting the lab ready for the upcoming instructor training. I was
planning on finishing it, but we lost power, so it'll just have to
wait another day.

We will be starting on the 16th now. It was the 14th which was cool
because that would have us ending on the 24th and Christmas could be a
double celebration. Now, I will have eight hours of class on Christmas
day and eight the next with my final exam as well.

I haven't really had the holiday blues. I know that traditionally the
holiday seasons are fraught with suicides because the people who are
without companionship have their lack accentuated. I expected to get
at least a bit being so far away from home, but haven't really yet.

I think there are two main parts to it. First is that I am doing
pretty well making friends here. I generally have people to hang out
with and do stuff with. It is not my family or girlfriend granted, but
they are good people.

Second is that it isn't Christmas here. The case with my course
accentuates that. Why not schedule a course on the 25th? It isn't
different from any other day on the Muslim calendar. Jesus gets
prophet who was deified by his followers status in Islam, but not big
enough to get his birthday celebrated. Even Mohammed's birthday is a
minor holiday. Interestingly, it is tracked on the lunar calendar, so
it happens a different time each year.

There is a definite disconnect when I walk into one of the French
supermarkets and see chocolates and fois gras. It is like being in a
theme park and seeing a mock up of "Christmas dishes from across the
sea." Here it is still in the 90's during the day and getting into the
70's at night. A far cry from the snow I need to see falling to
understand in my soul it is the Christmas season.

I still expect to have fun with it though. I saw some new cheese in
one of the supermarkets. It was called minuette or something, but
maybe it can pass for cheddar. At the least, maybe it won't be gross
spread over pineapples.

Love,
Will
