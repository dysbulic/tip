Ok, I lied about the unicode stuff a bit. =) I thought that how emacs
was saving the é character. I was looking at how emacs was saving it
and it was 0x81 0xE9, which I thought was utf-8. I don't have access
to the utf-8 codepages, but it seems like the 0x81 0xE9 is emacs
internal format. UTF-8 is 0xC3 0xA9 apparently.

I learned this when the message I sent yesterday was all screwed
up. Pine really doesn't seem to like sending and recieving
international messages.

As a note, to change emacs encoding system you use:
  M-x set-buffer-file-coding-system
or:
  C-x RET f

To see what the current encoding system is you use:
  C-h C RET

So, if your terminal is iso-8859-1 you should see A with a ~ and a
"latin s with caron" (it looks like a copyright on my screen) (Ã©)
instead of a é.

Btw, there is a handy little hexeditor called hexedit in redhat 9. It
is just like hexdump -C except interactive. A handy program for
dealing with character sets is iconv. Honestly, I am disappointed with
pine that all it does is say "this message is a different character
set; it may not look right."

P.S. I'd like to plug mutt for all the console using linux
people. Pine kept screwing up the encoding and decoding. It splits
certain bytes on sending, but not others and just generally doesn't
let me tell it what to do. The message I sent before was translated to
something other than the straight unicode bytes when it was sent and
pine doesn't display it right. (Mutt displays it correctly though, so
ymmv.)

I'd looked at mutt before on a Debian box because pine doesn't come
there by default (its free beer but not free speech,) but it looked
really simple and difficult to use. It turns out that what is really
going on is it is much more configurable and can do alot more than
pine, it just doesn't hold your hand.

Some very handy things are the ability to define "hooks" (like in
emacs) to execute arbitrary command when certain mailboxes are entered
or when certain messages are read or whatever. The other handy thing
is the ability to define key scripts (called macros) which will
execute a set of commands. They can be customized to only run on
certain screens like the message index or when reading a message.

I played for about two hours and had mutt doing everything I did in
pine and some others as well. =)
