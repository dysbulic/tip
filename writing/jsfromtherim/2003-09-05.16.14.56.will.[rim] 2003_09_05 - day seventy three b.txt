Robert and I were sitting playing with our computers and Robert asked
Habib where his was. Habib responded that he was without and Robert
responded with mock surprise and called him "sauvage."

Habib went from there into a spiel about how he knew it was a joke,
and it was ok, but that he wanted to talk anyway for about 5 minutes
about how it was offensive.

An interesting part of the conversation covered the social
stratification and how it may be alright to call the lower classes
(like black Africans) savage, but it's not something that one would
say to a white moor that they weren't very close to.

It was an interesting didactic to listen to given my cultural heritage
and America's fierce fight against racism.

I think I might have mentioned that slavery exists in some extent in
Mauritania. It was officially abolished sometime in the early 80's, but
it still exists. It isn't what slavery was in the U.S. and in many
ways race relations here are calmer than back home.

This area is certainly more diverse than where I came from. Probably
95% of my friends are white. It isn't a decision sort of thing, 95% of
the people I was in the vicinity of were white. There is definitely
alot of mixing of both races and cultures here. Mauritania is a
"border country" where the Arab Middle East joins Black Africa.

The predominant tensions right now are between Islamic fundamentalists
and the government. Back in 1989 though the tensions were more racial.
I don't know if I have written about it, but a border conflict over
some sheep grazing escalated into a full fledged expulsion of a
significant portion of the black population into Senegal. Apparently
there were entire villages of people that were simply forced into the
Senegal River.

The government invited everyone back and apologized sometime around '98
I think, but while all these people were gone their lands were claimed
by other people. A past volunteer told the story of how when she was
here, all the men in her village would periodically be arrested.
They'd hold them for a few days for farming the lands that they'd
owned before '89 but were now owned by someone else. Then they'd let
them out and they go back to farming. (Did I mention the acid trip
aspect to life here.)

The race thing is definitely something I want to think about while I'm
here. I can feel the division along race lines in the U.S. even if we
are supposed to be a colorblind country. It is the same way that I can
feel divisions along gender lines and even though I can't pinpoint how
it hurts anything, the process of thinking in those ways and making
those separations seems counter productive to something important.

I actually thought it would be weirder here than it has been. I get
the toubab thing whenever I walk down the street, but I haven't felt
really intimidated. I think maybe part of it is just arrogance. The
sense that I get from myself and from those around me that my country
is "better" somehow.

The happy egalitarian "everyone is a beautiful soul" sort of thinking
is a really good idea I think. Honestly though I've never managed to
actually live my life from that perspective. Maybe though that's where
the sense of separation I was lamenting earlier comes from. From
thinking I'm different/better in whatever way.

Love,
Will
