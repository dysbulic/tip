Well, I am back home in Nouakchott. Chinguetti was absolutely amazing.

The amazing adventures included a camel ride, visit to a thousand year
old walled city, seeing a 600 year old book, sleeping in an igloo,
visiting the most beautiful place in the country, and unwilling
expulsions from every orifice I have capable of such.

These tales are coming in as a special treat to those who have written
me since I've been here. I was writing on paper while up there and I
figure you took the time to write me so I'll return the favor. =)

I'll even be nice and not do it in French like my letters to Steph
have been. (I'm preping her to visit.)

Well, for now I just wanted to check in and say I'm not dead and we
still have Maaouya as president. He took around 65% of the vote from
what I've heard.

Love,
Will

P.S. Mauritania in the news: the Tiviski dairy is apparently one of
the only places in the world that makes cheese from camel milk.
(Having spent the day with one I am amazed they can be made to do
anything.) They are wanting to export it, but unfortunately food
stuffs are some of the more rigorously examined imports for most
countries.

I had some of it this afternoon though and it tasted pretty good. It
is not a mild brieish sort of flavor but not bitter. Interestingly
Tivisky has a website:
