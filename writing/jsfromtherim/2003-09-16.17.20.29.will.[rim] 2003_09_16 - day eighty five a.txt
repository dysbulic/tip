So much has been happening. I'm really frustrated because what I did
before with my mail is now not working. I've got a good twenty
messages sitting waiting to go out and I can't get it to cooperate. My
new plan is ip over ip tunneling; we'll see how that pans out.

Last night was my first night alone pretty much since I've been here.
It felt pretty good to lay around in my underwear, read my electronics
book and sweat a little. =) The place is absolutely filthy; anything
that sits still here for a day or so gathers a visible layer of dust.
Things, like the apartment that sit for a month, become a beach. I'm
going to try and find a broom before going home.

I went to the market and bought a couple pieces of fabric before I
left. I'm wanting to fix the place up even if I don't live there
permanently. I currently plan to be there for the rest of this month
and then the next. Where we go from there will just have to be seen. I
walked around a little today and there is perhaps a workable bike
route between the two.

Today was also my first day going to the university. I discovered
their tld name server is a Redhat 9 box, so they are using the same
setup that I do for my stuff. The webserver though that serves the
Cisco Academy is a Redhat 6 box. The build date on php is 1999.

The French thing is going alright. I really don't speak well, but I'm
getting more comfortable with it.

*-*

Ok, it is now the next day, but I never did get my email working...
Turns out I added dns to my service.switch and it was trying to use
that to find himinbi.org. It was after files and himinbi.org is in my
hosts file, so I really don't get it.

Everything has gone out now though and that's cool. I just hope people
read even though it came out in a big chunk like that.

I didn't go to work today. I was supposed to, but I was really feeling
tired and I'm really not supposed to be working now. I'm supposed to
get a week or so to get moved in and get house set up and stuff like
that.

So, I slept in and then spent my morning trying to get the toilet
working. What I am finding is there are a variety of things available
here, but they are all cheap. So, the toilet innards are crappy and
don't work. Mainly it is just that they don't seal correctly so it
leaks all the time, but also when it opens the flow isn't enough to
get the contents to go away. (The toilets here aren't a lever like in
the states, it's a sort of plunger that you lift by a knob in the
middle of the lid.)

I've been dumping a bucket of water into the bowl to get everything to
go away. I've not seen a plumbing store yet, but I assume there must
be one somewhere.

Well, I'm sleepy, so I'm gonna go sleep.

Love,
Will
