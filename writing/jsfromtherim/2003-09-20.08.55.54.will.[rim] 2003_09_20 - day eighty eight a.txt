Today has been a day for luxuries... Let me do a little math... 2.2kg
= 1lb. I ate probably 1/4 of 750g jar of chocolate spread, so that
would be about 2/5 a pound of chocolate. My insides are not very happy
currently by my mouth is forming a whole new opinion of Mauritania. =)

I went out to Pizza Lina last night with Jay and Robert. I don't think
I've mentioned, but Robert is ISing (taking Interrupted Service) over
a couple of issues. So he will be out of here on Monday and so we're
having a few final dinners together. (Something that has to stop
relatively soon or I'll not be able to pay rent.) =)

So after we ate we went to the Tiviski Dairy and bought two little
boxes of ice cream. Well, all the terms in that sentence are a little
loose. More specifically we bought mismatched tupperware of something
made with milk that had been frozen. It was certainly good enough for
me though. At this point I can't imagine disliking anything frozen.

I was thoroughly stuffed though after both the spaghetti I had and the
ice cream so I slept over at the hotel Jay and Robert are staying at.
After a pleasant nights sleep, only briefly interrupted with my
stomach's complaint about the unusually rich food I ate, I got up to a
new day. I discovered at this point that they had satellite TV and
among the dozen Arabic speaking channels there was a channel showing
American movies with Arabic subtitles.

I laid around and watched "My Cousin Vinny" and another one called
"Unfaithfully Yours" where Dudley Moore attempts to murder his wife
over a misunderstood affair. I got hungry but didn't really want to
brave the heat. Turns out the only food was the aforementioned pound
of chocolate which I proceeded to eat quite a bit of.

After the luxuries of TV, air conditioning and chocolate I really
don't see how this day can get any better. I'm going to piddle on the
computer for a bit and then see if I can buy a fan to sort of blow the
air around my sauna... I mean house.

Love,
Will
