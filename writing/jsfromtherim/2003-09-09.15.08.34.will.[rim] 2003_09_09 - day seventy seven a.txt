Last night was not an especially fun one. I woke up at around 3am with
the consequences of my untreated water a couple days ago beckoning to
be released. =)

I had actually been practicing learning the Arabic characters before I
went to bed and I was having a really odd dream. I was a necromancer
or something like that and I was intoning some sort of summoning spell.
(Which was written in Arabic.) I'm pretty sure this came from Faustus,
but if I said any part of it wrong then I would free the demon and he
would steal my soul.

As I was saying the spell sometimes my pronunciations would be on the
border of the permissible and as I approached being possessed I would
feel a wave of nausea. I awoke to the nausea and feared for a bit I
would lose my dinner in bed. I managed to get it under control though
and stumble out to the lavatory.

Have you ever seen the movie "Dumb and Dumber"? In one of the scenes
Jim Carey feeds a grotesque quantity of laxative to Jeff Bridges. When
the effects arrive and Jeff Bridges is the female lead's house and the
slack look on his face is as though an essential part of his being has
left his body via his anus.

Last night, that, combined with some nausea and the general effects of
going from a sound sleep to squatting for 20 minutes, was me. I stood
up in the bathroom once I was finished with my business and had a
serious moment of indecision as to whether I'd rather pass out or
throw up. 

All in all though my attitude isn't too badly affected. I've got some
muscle aches from the amount of fluid I've lost, but fortunately all
I have today is the language test at 7, so I've been asleep most of
the time. There are optional tutoring sessions, but I am opting not to
attend.

I did, after all, know that this was bound to happen when I drank the
water the other day. Having asked for it, so to speak, it seems silly
to be upset about it.

I'm glad it hit here rather than at my host families (we are back at
the lyc√©e). They had a game they liked to play, "hide the makaresh"
and also "hide the water." The idea of keeping a full pot of hand for
an emergency was a little foreign.

Well, I've gotta go take care of some stuff...

Love,
Will
