Today I went outside and laid around outside with one of my brothers as 
he was selling snacks to the local kids.

The thing that I recognized were the balbastik which I mentioned before 
from the cultural fair though I couldn't remember the exact name. It is 
just little plastic bags of ice which in this case was either besab (which 
I mentioned non-frozen recently) or pandesange mixed with water.

There were a variety of dried fruits though and with the help of wusaliman 
(my brother) I compiled this list in French and Pular:

pandesange (boheh) - the fruit of the baobab (boqui) - it is white looking
and oddly shaped. It isn't round or any consistent shape. There look to be 
dark seeds in it. From speaking to another of my brothers I get the 
impression that it is usually consumed dissolved in water. The name 
apparently also translates to "donkey break" because said creatures eat 
the fruit.

jijib (jabe) -the fruit of the jijibier (jabuli) - they look like dried 
out brown blueberries.

de pain d'acacia (mourtodeh) - the fruit of the acacia (mourtooque) - 
bigger than the jijib if you took the fruit of a ginko and dried it, it 
would look like this. Sort of off yellow and about the size of a shooter 
marble.

petit coco (gehloreh) - the fruit of the palmier (gelorgeh) - this is a 
bigger fruit, maybe and inch and a half in diameter. It looks sort of like 
a buckeye before they are out of the husk, or if you had a little brown 
apple and dried it out it would look like this.

I took a picture of all of them and if I ever get the program for putting 
pictures up I'll label them and put them up. =)

Wusaliman said he'd take me around and let me take pictures of the various 
trees later.

As for now everyone has gone off to the beach but me. Wusaliman wanted to 
go as well, and so I am waiting here for him to get back from praying. 
This is Friday and pretty much all the men go to the mosque to pray the 
afternoon prayer today. It was tempting to just run off, but making local 
friends is something I need to work at and I figure this is a good 
opportunity.

Love,
Will
