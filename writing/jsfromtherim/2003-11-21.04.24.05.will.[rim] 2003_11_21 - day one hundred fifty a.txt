I apologize for having been uncommunicative for the last few days. I am
having some really annoying technical problems that keep me from being
able to send out messages that are more than a couple lines.

Things have been going well other than the computer problems. I have a
couple messages from my birthday that will eventually make it out once I
get everything figured out. My goal was to make chocolate chip cookies,
but it turns out that brown sugar is very hard to find in this country. I
had one store that supposedly carried it, but it was closed at 7:00 when I
went to try and buy it.

Instead Marc went with me and we got the stuff to make yogurt. It is
surprisingly easy and tasty. The recipe goes something like this:

1. Put 1 liter of milk into a pot and heat close to boiling.
2. Take 1 liter of water and mix in evaporated milk until it is saturated.
    (I.e. no more will go in. It is something like milk gravy.)
3. Mix the evaporated milk with the warmed milk and hopefully the two will
    be warm, but not too hot for you to stick your finger in.
4. Stir a spoonful of yogurt to the mixture.
5. Go away for 12-24 hours leaving the mixture in a place without extreme
    temperature fluxuations.
6. Add sugar and fruit to taste. (We did pineapple.)
7. Spoon into plastic bags, tie off and freeze.
8. Eat.

It comes out really well. Ours we under sugared a bit and over fruited.
(The yogurt freezes like ice cream and the fruit like ice, so the
consistency was a little off.)

Thanksgiving is coming up soon and I'm going to try the cookies again.
Conveniently one of the listservs I am on just had a flurry of cookie
recipes. =) While in Chinguetti Lisa made creamed squash with butter and
sugar and cinnamon. Very good stuff.

Love,
Will
