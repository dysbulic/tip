We have switched up our classes a bit and now Robert takes his French in 
the morning with another class and then comes back with Habib and I in the 
afternoon. He was wanting to get more speaking and I was wanting to keep 
working on "competencies" where we cover a specific topic at length taking 
notes.

This morning Habib and I went to the market in search of some stuff for 
clothing. What I had in mind when we left was some of the tye-dyed fabric, 
but he wouldn't even go to the shop with me because "those shops are for 
women." It was very frustrating, but I guess I can go back by myself or 
maybe with me host mother.

The colors here are generally very bright and there are lots of complex 
patterns. Generally my clothes are neutral earth tones and subdued. I 
tried for a while to pick out something that both had a local flavor as 
well as wouldn't make me look like an idiot, but I never was really happy. 
I have a boubou on order from Mark's mom and so I was looking for a 
caftan. (A long caftan is pretty much a dress, or a sack with arms 
depending on how you look at it.) =)

I found a fabric I liked and the asking price was 3000 um and then the 
tailor would be another 700 um, So it would be about $12.50 outfit, but 
since I only make $1.50 a day, I need to adapt my pricing a bit. The one 
thing though is that worst comes to worst I can go to the bureau and 
change one of the three $100 bills I have. I'm really trying to economize 
though.

What I think I'll do is go with the boubou right now and go back without 
Habib and get some tye-dye. If I slowly replace my wardrobe over my time 
here I'm going to come back wearing horse-blankets (boubous), pj's (short 
(waist length) caftans), or dresses (long (ankle length) caftans).

Love,
Will
