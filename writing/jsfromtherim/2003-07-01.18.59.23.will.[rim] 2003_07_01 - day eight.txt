French has started. It is really tough. We have no English during class. 
There is one other fellow, Carl Strolle (http://strolle.com), with me and 
his French is pretty good. He was in Senegal taking French before coming 
here. He and my facilitator hang out and talk French to each other. I sit 
and nod.

Carl can't even speak French to me, so with vocab sorts of problems I am 
pretty much screwed. It is really tiring, but immersion is supposedly a 
really effective method. I guess it gives me a solid impetus to learn.

Today we were learning about greetings. There are three different ones 
that could exist:
  1: Normal handshake sort of thing. Bonjour and what-not.
  2: Embracing and doing the kisses on both cheeks.
  3: Genuflecting and going down on one knee and shaking with the other 
      person above you. Apparently this is not done in Mauritania.

Habib, our facilitator, tried for about five minutes to communicate to me 
that younger people will be the ones to introduce themselves. This level 
of abstraction was quite beyond me and eventually we gave up and I just 
waited until after the class to ask in English. I think I just need some 
sleep.

We have homework too. We have to wander around and ask people questions 
about where they are from and what they do. It is called a TDA (Trainee 
Directed Activity.)

One of the things that will be nice about being an ICT is that our tech
component is limited. Today the agfo (Agro-forestry) and ee (Environmental
Education) volunteers wandered out into the garden to learn about trying
to stop the Saharah Desert from spreading. (The people that are all
willing to attempt such a daunting task really amaze me.) The ch/ws
(Community Health and Water Sanitation) volunteers took a trip out to a
place where they are doing immunizations and watched the process. Again, a 
group that is willing to face amazing odds, this time to combat pervasive 
poverty and horrible sanitary conditions. The SED and ICT trainees worked 
more on our language. In many ways we are bringing skills in and so we 
don't require the same technical training. At the same time we will be 
working in more professional situations, so not sounding like a five year 
old is a plus.

I saw my first scorpion tonight. Supposedly the bites aren't deadly and 
just hurt like a son of a bitch. It was real quick and sand colored. 
Current volunteers don't report seeing many, and I hope to be able to 
report the same. We were sitting around playing cards and a fucking huge 
spider came running across our mat. We killed it and it was around two to 
three inches all spread out. The legs were thick like little crab legs. 
There are also beetles all over the place not seen any really huge ones, 
but part of one of our sanitation lessons mentioned how to use a syringe 
to suck the fluid out of the bite from a "blister beetle" which will give 
you a chemical burn and the pus from the sore will as well.

Honestly I've just been thinking about some stuff that's got me a little 
down and I am making it sound too harsh. There's not been anyone bitten by 
anything. The insects are bigger, but there's not a whole lot of other 
critters. If I were in the woods in Tennessee for a couple weeks I'd 
likely get bitten by all sorts of things.

I've been hanging out with the cool kids sort of. I have always wanted to 
be, but never managed, to really hang with the hip kids. I get along a 
whole lot better with "smart" kids who are more interested in brainy stuff 
than partying, but there aren't really many of those here. There's a 
philosophy major that seems cool, but I don't seem to be able to talk to 
her. There's an environmental engineer who is an intellectual, but her 
attitude is too TJ (see the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator for reference) to 
fill something... I want someone to relate to, not to debate with.

I suppose though that being alone is a big part of this. We leave for our 
homestay families on the 4th. Supposedly that is when we will start losing 
people. So far we have everyone we started out with. I was listening to a 
current volunteer talk about during their staging people taking bets on 
who would leave first. Most everyone here values their karma too much to 
go for that.

I just always sort of feel like I am faking and I don't like it. I talked 
to someone today who I feel like I am perhaps starting to connect with 
some. She left someone behind who she hopes to return to, so in many ways 
we are safe for each other I think.

Well, midnight fast approaches, so I am going to sleep.

Love,
Will
