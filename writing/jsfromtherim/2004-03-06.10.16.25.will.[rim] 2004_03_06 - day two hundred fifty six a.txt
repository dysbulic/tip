I'm thinking I am going to start littering my doorstep with their
corpses. No one knows how to write "here be dragons" in mosquito, do
they? Hell, I'd just end up with all the thrill seeking mosquitoes
coming to try their luck. Chez Will would become the Mount Everest of
mosquitodom. "Why? Because it's there."

I've been giving thought to the evolutionary arguments for monogamy
during my hunting foray this morning. The argument is that looking at
different types of primates their societies range from promiscuous
(males having as much sex as possible with no involvement in
nurturing) to polygynous (one male caring for several females) to
monogamous (a single male/female pair).

In looking at the differences between the species chimpanzees
(promiscuous), gorillas (polygynous) and marmosets (monogamous) there
are trends. Two of the major ones are body mass ratio and birth rate
by sex. As you get closer to monogamy the body masses between males
and females gets closer to the same. The hypothesis is that in
societies where there is more competition for women bigger males fare
better at passing on their genes. Another aspect is sex ratio where as
one approaches monogamy one approaches a 1:1 ratio.

Humans? Well, men are obviously a little larger than women. So far as
the sex ratio I am thinking it is somewhere around 1.1 in favor of
women. Most evolutionary biologists classify us as "mostly
monogamous."

Completely tangentially, I can't remember if I mentioned this article:
  http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501020603-250060,00.html

It talks about a lack of 50 million girls in China due to infanticide
and abortion. One depressing quote:

  "In China's poorest villages, fathers don't even count their
   daughters when asked how many children they have. 'Two strong
   sons,' says a millet farmer surnamed Yang when asked about his
   family. As an afterthought, he adds: 'Two donkeys. A pig. And one
   daughter.'"

To the point though, the number of mosquitoes to sign their death with
a red spear was about 90%. (Earlier we learned that only female
mosquitoes drink blood.) I had assumed that they were being born in my
house somewhere since it is pretty well closed. For this to be true
though the sex ratio difference would have to be pretty high. The
alternative is that they are getting in from outside through some
unknown ingress. I'm hoping for the later since it is easily solved,
but my cries to Thoth have thus far been ignored.

Anyhow, I reckon I'll get back to work...

Love,
Will

P.S. That got a smoked salmon in at one of the grocery stores. I have
a recipe for smoked salmon and cream cheese pitas. Yum. The problem?
Salmon is 15000um per kilo. Ouch, yeah, that'd be $50. Swiss cheese is
2000 a kilo and I very rarely have it.
