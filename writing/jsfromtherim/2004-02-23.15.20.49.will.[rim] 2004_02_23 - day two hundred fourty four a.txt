I just finished teaching my first class all alone and all (more or
less) in French. The real trick was I was teaching material that I've
got very little experience with.

I am a teacher's aid in a section of semester three (I am currently
only certified in semester one). The main teacher couldn't be here
today, so I was it tonight.

Cisco networking equipment is very nice and very pricey. Tonight I was
working with something called a switch. Back home I own a switch. It
is a very simple little box I plug computers into and they can talk to
each other. It cost about $25. The Cisco switch I was teaching tonight
has a little computer in it that I can connect to and configure to do
a variety of networking fanciness. It cost about $600. Other than not
having a real need of networking fanciness you can guess why I don't
have a whole lot of experience with Cisco equipment.

I'm trying to focus alot on the basics of networking and not the
specific characteristics of the Cisco equipment because I know as a
poor person that most of my students will not have this equipment to
work with in the future.

Teaching was fun though. The course has little hands on workshop
sections and I was doing one of those. Thankfully I could mostly hang
back and let the students try and figure stuff out. My inability to
say anything intelligible certainly aided my restraint. I would just
wait for someone to say an answer that sounded good and then back them
up. All in all though I think it was beneficial for them. I explained
a couple things about wiring that I think really made the reasons why
we do certain things clearer.

As for the French it is coming. I have a couple students with some
English and when I get stuck against the wall I'll start saying
English synonyms until one of them recognizes one. It makes for
interesting communication but communication nonetheless.

I am pretty well fried though both from the French and the being
regarded as the authority on stuff I didn't actually know. I am really
dreading Lent... I've been thinking my life is getting sort of mundane
in the last bit, this ought to make it interesting if not enjoyable.

Love,
Will
