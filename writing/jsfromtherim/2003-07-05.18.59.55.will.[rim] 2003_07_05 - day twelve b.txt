Well, it is now 11:30am and it is surprising how long a day feels when it
starts at 6 and it is too hot to do anything but sit around and sleep.

I put a towel across the missing pane in my screen and I think I trapped a 
bunch of flies inside because they started to collect on the remaining 
panes. I killed about half an hour filling a tin with little fly corpses. 
I was going to litter them across the window sill as a warning to the 
others, but ants came along and carried most of them off while I was 
outside. Instead I have decided to start an ant farm in one corner.

Currently I am just training them to stay in their corner by squishing any 
wandering ones, but I have high hopes for them and one day hope to train 
them to gather food and perhaps even program in VB. It is a sufficiently 
pedantic task I think. =)

Love,
Will
