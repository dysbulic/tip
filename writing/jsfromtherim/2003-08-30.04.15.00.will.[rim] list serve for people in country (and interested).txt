There is another listserv that exists that has all of us trainees on it. 
There isn't much traffic on it, but we sometimes pass around notes like 
when someone finds out some interesting news or when someone starts a 
webpage or something like that.

I've had a couple requests from family members of people to be on that 
list and so we are going to start adding people. If you are interested, 
just send mail to mauritanians-request@divalicio.us with the subject 
"subscribe". (Or just e-mail me.)

Love,
Will
