So many little things to mention... I remember now talking to Steph one
time early in our relationship about how we will surely use up all the
meaningful things that we have to say to one another after a while. Right 
now there are just so many interesting things and I hope that I won't stop 
seeing new ones anytime soon.

I learned some new eating skills today. I have been heretofore trying to 
take my various meals and make them into little balls with the rice and 
pop them into my mouth. It turns out that this is only really appropriate 
with the rice and fish. When eating something with alot of sauce the 
method is to simply get a good sized chunk at the tips of your fingers and 
then lick the glob off.

It is certainly easier. =)

After lunch we went outside and laid around under one of the trees so that 
the wind could get at us. A fellow who I saw a couple days ago came over 
to chat for a bit. He doesn't speak very much French, so he and I can 
hardly communicate at all.

After identifying in succession every conceivable part of his body in both 
Hassinya and Arabic he proceeded to do some impressions. First he did a 
G.W. Bush, then a Saddam Hussein and a Bill Clinton. Unfortunately he did 
his impressions in Arabic, so most of the import was lost on me. We had a 
good laugh anyway though. =)

My brother (or at least a guy who is around the house alot) was reading a
paper and I noticed a website address. http://nouakchottinfo.com if 
anyone is interested. The paper was in French, so I assume the website is 
as well.

While we lay there a local mother empirically verified that it is not 
possible to beat a small child into being quiet. The closest that she got 
was that the kid started getting hoarse after screaming for 15 minutes.

Love,
Will
