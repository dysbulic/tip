And God said, "let there be light, and there was light and it was good." 
Or, I say "I need a place to plug in my computer and a few days later an 
outlet appears in my room and it is good.

I really like this little laptop. I fear for its life. I try not to use it 
except at night when it is a balmy 90 degrees, and I keep it in  big 
plastic bag that Matt gave me, but it is just impossible to keep the sand 
out and it is always hot here. The cybercafe has come back to life after a 
week and if it is still alive tomorrow I am going to take this laptop by 
and get these journals sent off. Inshallah. (God willing.)

I think I have it fixed so that all I need to do is plug it in.

So much has happened since I last wrote that I can't remember what I have 
already covered...

The newest news is that we are down six volunteers. Five guys and a girl. 
There is a rumor of a sixth guy. We started out with 23 guys and 26 girls 
and 3 couples. (That's 23/49 ~= 46% guys.) Now we may be at 18/43 ~= 41% 
guys. That's pretty close to the current average of 39%. Apparently the 
girls are just tougher. =)

Nick left before even going to homestay and I think that Charlie was only 
there for a bit. The only person that I really got to talk to was Jason 
who was in my group. I think that the stress of the change just got to 
him.

The differences have really not been that dramatic for me. It is hot and I 
don't have many of the amenities that I did, but I still am spending my 
days studying and trying to keep myself entertained.

The French is going pretty well. Now that Jason is gone it is just Robert 
and I taking French. Matt and Carl spoke French well enough that they 
didn't have to take any more and they are learning Hassinya. I hope to 
learn it some day, but it really is a different language. French is 
nothing compared to Hassinya. The letters are different and the sounds are 
different and the phrase structure is different. For right now French is 
my only priority.

Today was the closest that I have come to a bad day. We did French for 
four hours this morning and I had a headache from straining to understand 
so much. We all ate lunch together and then I tried to take a nap at 
Habib's. There were flies all over the damn place though and they kept 
walking on my face and waking me up. So, after an hour it was time for 
more French, I still had a headache and I hadn't gotten any appreciable 
sleep. Mostly I just sat around mumbling about the damned flies and taking 
half hearted swats at them.

We only did an hour though and then we had an assignment to scout out the 
market. I considered going boubou (pronounced like yogi's buddy,) but I 
decided to wait until I am able speak complete sentences.

The local currency is ougias. The exchange rate is something like 265
ougias per dollar. We get our perdiem in 1000 ($3.75) ougia notes and many
of the vendors can't change them. I really don't understand why since a 
canned soda costs about 100 ougias and the internet is 200 an hour. It 
seems like their cash flow would have to be sufficient unless they only do 
two transactions a day.

There are boutiques which are spread around the city and then there is the
market which is housed in buildings sort of like those stor-all places. 
Big garage type doors almost the width of the room. All the merchandise 
stacked along the walls. And like a flea market the price you get when you 
ask the price is only the starting point for negotiation.

I really should go to bed. I have another four hours in the morning of 
French. Yippie. I have some more notes to write on, but it is past 
midnight and the day begins at sunrise with the first prayer call and the 
flies awakening from their slumber.

Love,
Will
