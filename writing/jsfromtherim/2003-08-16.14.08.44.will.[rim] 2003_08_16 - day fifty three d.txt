Made it into Kaédi without any serious problems. We had a bonus person
and left an hour late, so we fared pretty well. I hardly recognize Kaédi
though. There were lots of pondish sorts of things on the way down and
lots of grass. The land is pretty flat, so when water falls it sort of
spreads. =)

We actually passed a creek and some nearly chubby goats. Not only that,
but it is cooler here than in Nouakchott right now because of all the
rain. The big downside is the bugs of all sorts are swarming.
Unfortunately among the things that are following me down soon is my
mosquito net. I'll tough it out though. =)

After dinner about half of the trainees gathered to talk about their
grievances with the swearing stuff. We haven't actually received official
word and all of this is through rumor which really irritates some people
(whose lives are drastically affected.) The big thing for people is to
just make it to Nouakchott before December.

I really don't know what the PC's concerns are and what can be done. This
inability to comprehend is mostly because of how information is sort of
leaking down. We don't know what's up and that can be frustrating.

They're drafting a letter though, so maybe at the least we can express
ourselves...

Well, it is getting late and I'm sleepy, so I'll be in touch. =)

Love,
Will
