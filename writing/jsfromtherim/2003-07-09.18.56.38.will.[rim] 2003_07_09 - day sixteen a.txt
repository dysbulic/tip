Ick. My worst day so far. It is only 11 and I am already worn out. I was 
tired yesterday from all the French and then I didn't get my bed moved 
before the sun went down so I slept inside. It hasn't been too hot inside, 
but I had the shits last night and when they were putting in the outlet 
they opened the window and let alot of flies in.

So, I got far too little sleep. I have just been hot and sweaty and 
always, always the damned flies. Imagine a little kid poking you in the 
side. Poking and poking and poking tirelessly. Not really that much to 
deal with in a single instance, but it never ceases.

Really, I think that I would be happy if I could just kill some flies and 
take a bath. Not really to lessen the number of flies but just to take 
some revenge on the little sons of bitches for constantly lighting on my 
hands, in my ears, on my mouth and wherever else they can find.

I've decided that the only thing I really care to impart to my pet ants is 
a lasting hatred of flies. If I could train them to lie in wait and pull 
their wings off it would be good. Maybe after a while I can train them in 
the construction of tiny crucifixes.

Anyhow, I'm going to try and kill some of the ones trapped in this room 
and take a nap. I used to have this whole compassion for living beings 
thing going on. Fuck that. Die flies die. =)

Love,
Will
