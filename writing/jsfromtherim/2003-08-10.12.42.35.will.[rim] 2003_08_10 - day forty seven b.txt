Something that I am really interested in playing with as a side project 
right now is mapping. Nouakchott is a city of anywhere from 1-1.5 million 
people (40-50% of the countries population) and I have as of yet to be 
able to find anyone who has seen a map of the place. It was constructed to 
hold 15,000 in 1950, so it has been growing pretty quickly and the 
haphazard organization reflects that.

It is difficult because there are a variety of interesting places in the 
city, but you can't describe the location to someone unfamiliar with the 
city because there is no map. When traveling around it is interesting too 
because generally the streets aren't named and you have to know the name 
of a landmark in the vicinity of where you want to be. Especially 
interesting is that some of the landmarks don't exist anymore. For 
instance if I wanted to go to the school where my language classes were 
held I would go to the Pharmacie Peuple (The People's Pharmacy) which was 
apparently a pretty famous place when it existed. =)

There is a book called "West Africa: The Rough Guide" that Robert has that 
has little maps of pieces of Capitale and Ksar, but they are out of date 
and limited.

There are two places that I am hoping to check for a lead on a map. All of 
the houses have numbers on them and reportedly this was done by some sort 
of ministry of housing. We were in a leasing office and there were big 
(3'x3') maps of city blocks, so maybe they have a more general map as 
well. The other is the utility companies. There is phone, water and power 
over most of the city and someone should have some idea of how those 
lines/pipes correspond to houses and streets. Maybe I'll be able to find 
those somewhere.

My backup plan (which is more entertaining) is trying to do a little 
mapping on my own. I've been reading about mapping by flying a camera up 
on a kite and using the aerial photographs. I've not seen anything that 
looks like it was done on a large scale, but it is just cool to imagine 
being able to see what the place actually looks like:

I also went to a couple of talks about image stitching and AI at the last 
conference I was at and it sounds like an interesting field. In particular 
it seems like stuff like trying to adjust for altitude differences and 
camera rotation and light differences and so many things would be really 
interesting. I can imagine having it operate dynamically and that would be 
pretty.

Speak of the devil... We went to try and visit the wali (a high ranking 
governmental official) and though we did not make it to the wali we made it 
to the adjoint wali and he had on his wall a huge map of all of Nouakchott 
from the "Office of Cartography and Organization" (or something close it 
was French.) It was exactly what I am looking for except for being 4.5'x3' 
and paper. It lets me know though that somewhere in this town that map 
exists and given how it was produced it exists on a computer. Now all I 
have to do is find it. =)

Surely that's possible. Inshallah.

The kite stuff still sounds entertaining, but just for prettiness. I need 
a geeky project to play with where I build something. Maybe I can find one 
that benefits the Mauritanians; that being why I am here and all. =)

Love,
Will
