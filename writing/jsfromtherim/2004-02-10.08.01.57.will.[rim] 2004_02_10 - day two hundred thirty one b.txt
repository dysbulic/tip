I mentioned during stage that methylquine has the effect of increasing
the vividity of dreams. This has been holding true for me pretty much
throughout.

One of the stereotypical experiences for a Peace Corps volunteer
returning to the States is a sense of jaded disillusionment with the
indulgence of American culture.

One class of dreams that I have been having is that I am back home. I
will have been there for a while and we are in the midst of just
sitting around talking or some such thing. I will suddenly come to the
awareness that I am not in Mauritania and I will be struck with a near
insatiable desire to consume.

I will start trying to get someone to take me to Wal-Mart so that I
can buy stuff. I am really afraid that I am going to have to go back
to Mauritania soon and I won't be able to buy stuff anymore. Most of
the time it is foods. Orange juice and ice cream and the like...

I don't know if I have mentioned or not the fixation on a good ham
sandwich I have been nursing for the last month or so. Yesterday my
dream was that I was in the flea market in a Hickory Farms outlet and
I was walking through racks and racks of smoked, honey glazed, country
and boiled hams. It was such a sensual experience as to nearly qualify
as erotic.

What is strange is that I am not at all unhappy materially. I eat
well. I have everything I need. Why I should be so fixated on
consuming is beyond me. The things that I can't get easily here are
books and electronics, but I never dream about buying those things.

It has been happening with such frequency that I now recognize it as
it is happening. One time I was sitting in my gramdma's living room
talking to her about something when it hit. I turned to her and asked,
"I've never come back from Mauritania. This is a dream isn't it?" To
which she replied "yes," and we went on talking.

I do think that one of the things I am learning here in a real way is
moderation. My budget is pretty limited as is and there are many
products only sold in a few places. Back home if I decided I wanted to
make something certain for supper I'd make my list, head to the Kroger
and be well on my way. Here I have to make my list, figure out what
substitutions I have to make to fit products available here, then
begin the process of visiting perhaps half a dozen different stores to
find everything. Since I am either on foot or riding my bike this
process is not necessarily a quick one.

For instance I have been collecting the ingredients to make curry for
about a week now. The current challenging ingredient is flour. The
store that did sell flour now doesn't and though corn flour is
semi-common, all purpose flour is a bit rare. So, this afternoon I
will ride out to a store about a mile away in the hopes that they have
it.

Like I was saying most things are possible here and I certainly am not
suffering, it just takes more work. Perhaps it is the convenience that
I am seeking in my dreams of Wal-Mart. =)

Love,
Will

P.S. To illustrate the complexity of what is possible though I will
mention that we made huevos rancheros the other night which contained:
eggs, garlic, black eyed peas (no pintos here), yellow rice, white
onions, green onions, tomatoes, peppers (habanero maybe), red bell
peppers, pitas, hummus, cumin, curry, mayonnaise, and a cheese that was
pretty close to colby. So, as you can see there are lots of basic
ingredients here, it is just a scavenger hunt to find them all.
