I am hoping that I am heading into a period of reflection and change.

Honestly my hopes are not that high right now. This feels like just
another place that I've been once before and didn't make good use of
then, so why should I think things will be different now?

I've not been writing much as of late. There's not a good reason for
it really. I've not been working very much. I've not had any projects
going. It is nothing really other than indolence. Laziness seems to be
the primary theme in my life as of late.

I used to be pretty good at throwing myself into my work when I would
feel down. I could solace myself with the idea that I was good at what
I was doing and that whatever it was gave my life some semblance of
meaning.

Now it really doesn't hold that much appeal. I'm realizing that I
don't care that much about this country and even if I did there's
nothing I am going to do to make much of a difference anyhow.

Back in high school I was a pretty sad kid. There was a rumor that I
was gay and it pretty much killed my social life for several years.
Being in high school and not having any friends is a pretty shitty
way to live. One of the places I looked for solace were fantasies
about God having something great planned for me and me needing to be
really strong to be able to do it. That the pain I was suffering was
somehow going to be rewarded with great accomplishments later in life.

I still hold onto both messiah and martyr dramas now. Seeing myself as
a misunderstood genius may not gain friends or influence people, but
it does give me an easy answer and a sense of superiority.

I am not changing though. Not really. Sometimes I put a new coat of
paint on, but it is the same house underneath. I've been walking
around today pitying myself for my lack of connection to other people.
That my insecurity causes me to hold myself back and that I can't be
natural. This is the same problem I have been complaining of for years
now. What has changed? My games have gotten fancier. I understand alot
more of the rules for interactions and can function better than I
could eight years ago. Am I really changing though? In essence I am
the same person, just a new bag of tricks.

Back home I always had work to do. I would tell myself that of course
I needed to earn a living, but my work is also important to me. Here I
don't have to work. When I wake up in the morning and don't want to go
in, I don't. What I am finding in this environment is that my work
isn't that important to me.

Do I care about the betterment of humanity? Do I wake up and want to
go off and make the world a better place for the people starving in
this country? Eh, not really. I thought I did at least a bit, but I am
pretty sure most of what I cared about was believing myself to be a
good person. I was going into my house the other day and noticed for
the first time that I don't really believe that. I don't think I'm a
really bad person. I try to be fair and what-not, but most of that is
just not getting off especially on having bunches of shit. I'm pretty
sure if I was the sort of person who did enjoy that then I'd be all
over it.

I'm reading tho books right now. I just finished Jason's chapter in
The Sound and the Fury. He is a selfish person. He uses those around
him to get what he wants. I can't say though that I am essentially
different from him though. It just happens that what I want is for
people to like me and to feel close to them. If I believed I could get
there by being mean and spiteful and could get away with it I am not
sure I wouldn't.

What I things breeds real compassion is an awareness of our
interconnectedness. When I can see and respect the humanity in the
people around me I try and find the best for them the same as I would
for myself. It is a lack of any real awareness of that connection that
leaves me morally stunted.

I'm also part of the way into Notes from the Underground. The guy
doesn't like himself very much. He damns his self awareness. For me
that feels pretentious since I revere self-awareness so much. I do
relate though very well to seeing that you are not enough and also
seeing that you are not going to change. The best you can do is hide
away and learn to live with being as you are.

Throughout this whole process I am aware of developmental models that
talk about having to give up your pictures in order to have the space
to make new ones. So all the while I am indulging these dramas I can
have one part of my mind secretly contented and happy that in my
spiritual wonderfulness I am facing my selfishness and egotism.

All that I ever manage to do is reduce it to a game. I take it apart
and watch my life rather than living it. You know at the end of Brave
New World where the savage will stand out and beat himself to pay
penance? I feel like I need some sort of penance. The penance would
be the reward though if I could only really be taken by the experience
and not simply have it be another move in the game.

So it goes...

Love,
Will

P.S. Some of you don't get stuff like this from me ever. Don't worry
about me I'm just melodramatic. As I said it is always a game and I
never let myself lose control. That's the problem really...
