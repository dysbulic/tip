We went out with some French UN interns and I learned just how
different African French and French French are. I was sitting there
listening to this girl repeatedly say "tu n'a pas fait Ã§a?" ("you
haven't done that?") Very simple French sentence and I hadn't the
foggiest clue what was coming out of her mouth.

I'm meeting my parents in Paris next summer and by golly I am going to
do my darnedest to not have end up wandering around unable to
understand a damned thing.

My African French is getting alright. I am still a long way from being
conversational, but it is progressing. My upcoming course is going to
mess with my tutoring, but maybe in January things will calm back
down.

I was also talking to Matt today about usages of French grammar that
exist here. Apparently there are a variety of usages here that a
French person may well understand but that they would never say
themselves.

I think I need to make a French friend and hang out with them often
enough that hopefully I can wade through the accent consistently.

Love,
Will
