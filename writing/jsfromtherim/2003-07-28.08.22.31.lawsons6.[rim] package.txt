Will,
     After speaking to your mother over the weekend I have decided to send
part of the package Sandy and I put together. I am not sending everything
at once but am sending medicine for your stomach, eye drops, asprin, and
some lotion. Steph said it can take 2-3 weeks for you to get this so keep
an eye out for it incase you are on the move when it arrives. Also, info
on how to get you money would be helpful. Does the PC have a banking
system set up for its volunteers? How far is it from your current location
to your assignment location? Also, I thought of sending your host family a
gift of diffent teas we have in the states. Since tea is so important, is
this a good idea or extremely poor idea? I certainly do not want to make
them sick with some of our flavored teas. I think it is always a good idea
to show respect and gratitude for those that help you. Please let me know
the ages of the family members. By the way, your package is being sent by
regular mail and is going out today, 7-28-03.
Much love from the Good Ole USA.
Sharon
