We've been putting together a directory of all the different staff
members, trainers and volunteers so that our fresh mea... um,
stagiaiers will have some hope of learning the hundred plus new people
they're about to meet.

I'm in this morning because I've been asked to add a little bit of
information to the entries for the training staff: marital status and
number of children.

Last year there was some confusion on the topic for some people. I'm
pretty sure it arose for a significant number of the trainers telling
the stagiaiers that they weren't married. =) It's an odd phenomenon
and it seemed especially to happen to the women.

Love,
Will
