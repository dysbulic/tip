Things have been busy the last couple days. There is another broken
laptop at the university, and I downloaded the tools to try and fix
it, but I can't get it to burn onto a CD. The guy who owns it
irritated me too because after one CD didn't work he wanted me to try
and find another. (He bought the first.) For me to pay to fix his
laptop is just silly.

I am also trying to get moved out of Rhonda's before the end of the
month. Having a place more centrally located in town is proving very
nice. It cuts about half an hour off my travel time each day.
Theoretically the PC is going to help me out with a car today,
Inshallah.

The election is still keeping pretty busy. Because of Ramadan not a
whole lot goes on during the day. When the sun goes down there is a
span of about an hour where this place is a ghost town. After a bit
though things start to wind back up.

There was a MTV show a while back called "Making the Band" and they
would go through the production of a formulaic sort of group; "boy
band" or "hip-hop" or whatever. I keep thinking about that show when
riding around town for some reason. I think it has something to do
with the new Maaouya logo or maybe the new Maaouya (Senegalese) rap
song though perhaps it is the thousands of Maaouya posters or the one
place that has a laser show for Maaouya on the side of a building. I
am just waiting to see kids pulling their Maaouya action figures out
of the Maaouya backpacks. Maybe I'll be able to get a Maaouya burger
at the Maaouya Hot. =)

I am appreciating American style democracy a bit more. Money still
matters a whole lot, but at least the field is a little more level.

Love,
Will
