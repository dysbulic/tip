10:30am - Went to visit the liberty square. Saw the Philadelphia State 
House, also known as Independence House. It was really neat to see "the 
most historic room in the most historic house in the most historic square 
mile in the country." They had the original chair that George Washington 
sat in during the Continental Congress.

Our tour guide was really cool too. It was a pudgy fellow with long gray 
hair and big round spectacles. He was working the Ben Franklin look hard.

I was traveling with another volunteer who is a triple
chemistry/history/German major. He has recently come back from a year
in Germany studying abroad. Heather, who I was walking with last night
came back from teaching English in Taiwan and spent alot of time in
Honduras. Melanie, who I ate supper with, was off doing health work in
Mexico. My roommate, Bob, flew in from taking French lessons in
Nice. It is just amazing how well traveled all these people who are
younger than me are. I figure I'll be learning soon enough. =)

We went to see the Liberty Bell. The building they have it in is
pretty cool. Lots of aluminum and glass. History note for the day. The
name "Liberty Bell" actually didn't come into usage until the 1830's
when a poem written by an abolitionist coined the term. It weighs
2080lbs and rang for 93 years.

Well, more training. A couple of you can expect bell postcards if I
can find some stamps.

Love,
Will
