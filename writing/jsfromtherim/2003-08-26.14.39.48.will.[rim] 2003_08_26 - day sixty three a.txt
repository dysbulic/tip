Emotional expressiveness is something I have been noticing alot here. It 
is like they are minus a layer of veneer that we have back home. People 
get in very animated arguments and are waving their hands and raising 
their voices all the time. It's not fighting though, it's just how people 
discuss.

One of the places I have really liked seeing it is with the baby. Just 
about everyone who comes by plays with the baby. They pick it up and make 
all sorts of noises and sing little songs. It is true of both the men and 
the women. People seeming self conscious about their appearance is not 
something that I have really seen in my family (which is black moor.)

Habib actually entertains me because he sort of acts prissy sometimes,
which is fine and all, but the environment isn't really conducive to
maintaining the image. I remember watching a documentary about the palace
at Versailles which was built without plumbing. So, people who had to go
to the bathroom would often simply squat in the corner and make a little
poopie. =) You'd have women (and men) who spent hours primping and getting
ready, but at the end of it all they were walking down halls full of shit.

It is just funny because he will act as though his sensibilities are very 
delicate, but I've seen the hole he craps in and the concrete floor is bed 
is on.

On the subject of veneer though, I've also definitely seen the most 
abusive behavior here as well. The other day my host father smacked my 
brother, Omar, several times about the head hard. I was actually angered 
to see and wanted to tell him to stop. Omar is maybe five and he is a 
really good kid. Always very soft spoken, but very helpful. Whenever I 
leave the may under the tree and move over to the patio or go to my room a 
couple minutes later Omar will come trailing along carrying my notebook or 
water bottle or anything I forgot.

The new lamb that I mentioned a couple days ago, some nights Omar will 
have to put the rope around its neck to hold it. It is very comical to 
watch because the lamb comes up to about Omar's stomach and he'll have to 
try and wrestle it down to get the rope around its neck.

Omar isn't the child of Mousah and Momah (my parents) he is the son of
Mousah's little sister, who lives in Nouakchott, and I wonder if that has
anything to do with the difference in his treatment, or if it is just an
age thing.

I suppose as I am here more I'll get to see.

Love,
Will
