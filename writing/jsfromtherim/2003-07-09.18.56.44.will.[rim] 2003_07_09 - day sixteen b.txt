We finished our evening French class and Habib walked outside and 
excitedly exclaimed "it's raining!" I thought he was a little worked up 
over some rain, but when I walked outside I learned that "it's raining" 
translates to "there is a 300 foot wall of sand about to engulf the town." 
Those pictures they show where the entire horizon is engulfed by sand is 
really what it looks like.

I don't want to run the laptop though since all the sand in the air can't 
be good for the fans. I had hoped to get this stuff out tonight, but it 
looks like that won't be happening. Perhaps tomorrow inshallah.

Love,
Will

P.S. Closed the doors and killed flies for an hour this afternoon and my 
attitude is much improved. =)
