This will be a quick catchall because I am leaving town for a week in
about twenty minutes...

I was in the wrong with Tech. My understanding was that the things
that I put up were not protected by copyright. It turns out that at
least one, Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech is.

When things don't work or are inefficient here I will often say to
someone "Bienvenue Ã  Mauritanie" ("Welcome to Mauritania"). It is just
how things work here. Likewise when reading about the family of MLK
suing people left and right over the usage of his works I think,
"Welcome to America". Everything's property and everything's for sale,
right?

I feel bad about the whole thing with the server because I really did
believe I wasn't doing anything wrong. To have put the honors program
(and the university) in legal jeopardy because of my ignorance is very
disturbing to me.

Went out last night and smoked a hookah. You remember in the cartoon
of _Alice in Wonderland_ where she is in the garden and meets a
caterpillar? He is smoking from a tube coming from a odd pillar
looking contraption. That is a hookah.

You smoke a flavored tobacco called shisha. Ours was apple.

All in all pretty entertaining. It is decidedly less harsh than
smoking cigarettes. I didn't feel especially affected mentally, but I
usually don't smoking cigarettes either. Well, I've done it twice now
and didn't really get into it.

I don't plan on doing it again anytime soon since I'm sure it has all
the same fun side effects as other types of smoking. It was neat
though to be able to say I'd done it.

Went as a living English sample to a class that a friend of mine
teaches. In honor of my coming he taught them the words "hillbilly,"
"yokel" and "redneck." I then got to try and explain the nuances
between them. I also taught them the word "drawl."

I was perhaps a bit overzealous and taught them that we use the words
"bourgeoisie" and "proletariat." Hopefully people know what they are
talking about.

*-*

As I mentioned I am leaving town. I'll be going back to Chinguetti and
then to Choum where I will catch the train coming from the iron mines
in Zouirat to Nouadhibou.

It is a trip I knew I wanted to take before I left and there are some
volunteers in from Senegal who are doing it and I'm tagging along.
I've got some work to do in several cities in the north, so it works
out well.

*-*

If I do get removed from the honors computer I will disappear from the
internet. I'm going to work at getting back, but if there is a lapse
you will know why.

Well, I'm off.

Love,
Will
