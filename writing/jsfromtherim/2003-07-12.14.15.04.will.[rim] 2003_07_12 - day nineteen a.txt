I had a sort of realization today about both my life before and what my 
life is now. Before I was pretty sure that I was pretty safe all of the 
time. There are outside chances that something odd could happen like a car 
accident while I was uninsured, but all in all things were safe.

Last night I went to the nurse because I was shitting out any water I 
consumed within an hour of drinking it. I was getting very dehydrated and 
hadn't eaten for two days. She gave me a dozen cipro (antibiotic) to take 
for the next week.

While in my fevered state I apparently pissed off a blister beetle because
this morning I have about two and a half inches worth of burn on my knee
as well as an inch on my arm.

(I am happy that it is my left arm because that allows me to care for it
with my right "clean" hand because it is pretty tough to keep your hands
clean when you are in the toilet six times a day and sticking your hands
in crap each time.)

The thing that worries me a bit about the burn is the exposed flesh is 
very susceptible to infection, so since Matt and I walked over there 
anyway I decided to check in to make sure that I was caring for it 
correctly.

I almost don't like saying this because it makes it sound as though this
person is incompetent which I don't think that she is. She is the nurses
assistant and her job here is mainly just watching the trainees while they
get sick and deal with the next diseases that they are unaccustomed to.  
The solution to pretty much all of them is rest and perhaps antibiotics.  
Anyhow, she came out offering me an antifungal because the package
mentions "soothing burning and itching" and she was unaware of the
antibiotic creme in the medkit.

She put me on omoycilin in addition to the cipro and ibuprofen that I am 
already taking.

I've just never been much of a drug person and I'm not very trusting of 
things that I don't understand. Like with flying; I was cool getting on 
the planes that I rode on in large part because Wayne gave me a lesson on 
the stresses that the wings can take and why it is highly unlikely that 
they will fall off. I just know that pharmaceuticals is a complex science 
and feel uncomfortable using it without a real understanding of what is 
going on. =)

I don't think that I've been taking pills three at a time for as long as I 
can remember. I'm taking all my drugs though. I have no good reason not to 
and if something happens to me I'll feel better if it is someone else's 
fault rather than mine for not doing what I was told. =)

I do feel pretty good though, inshallah. I ate some lunch and it has not 
yet come out. 

Love,
Will

P.S. I'd hoped to send this stuff out, but the cell phone provider is out 
and they apparently don't fix things on the weekend. Khaedi is literally 
incommunicado right now. I think that the main PC office may have a 
satellite phone, but that's it.

P.P.S. Two more trainees ET'd: April and Diane. That puts the total at 8. 
Honestly at this point I don't fault anyone for leaving. This place is 
damn hard.
