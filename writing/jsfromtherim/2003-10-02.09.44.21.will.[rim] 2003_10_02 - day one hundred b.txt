I feel like I need to do a little "happy things" journal since I've
had quite q few negative ones over the last few days. I'm really not
unhappy here and things that are pleasing me currently:

Time is great. I generally have lots and I am really enjoying the
African sense of time. I've been playing with programming ideas I'd
been contemplating for a while and never had the time to really look
at.

Reading is advancing. I have a copy of The Little Prince from Carl and
Sharon sent me a really awesome comic book in French. I'm sure she
didn't know it, but it is especially cool because it is a Marvel comic
from '82 and the basic premise is that super heroes from around the
world are collected by these omnipotent beings to take part in their
"Tournament of Champions." I'm going to write about it more because it
is a really interesting set of social statements both the powers and
the dialog of the different characters.

For example, the martial arts super hero from China whose powers
include the ability to split into many people working for "the common
good." I'm wanting to write about it in more depth though. Oh yeah,
it's in French too.

I like my apartment. It is not as "native" as I'd perhaps like, but it
is pretty far away from the "petron" (rich person) part of town. It is
really easy in the large urban centers to start getting hooked in with
the expat communities and not make Mauritanian friends. The place is
pricier than I like, but I'm going to give it a bit and also try out
Matt's place.

Food has been good. I am not eating great, but I am slowly finding
both places to eat that aren't too expensive and different places to
buy stuff. I found a new patisserie today which sells "round bread"
which is like a roll about 9 inches around. I wonder what happens when
you go on the opposite of The Atkin's Diet? About 85-90% of my food
now is bread, pasta or sugar.

I recently went to the PCMO's office because my water filter
disappeared in the move from Ka√©di. I weigh about 175 now. My bike has
been postponed again because it was decided that they'd take care of
the villages before us city folk. So, the new date is Monday. Maybe
tomorrow though I'll give jogging a try. I thought I brought more than
one pair of socks, but I haven't been able to find them.

I'm thinking my tasks for tomorrow are shopping for some wash buckets,
washing some undies and maybe buying a little electric burner and a
teapot to make coffee in the morning.

Anyhow, I really am doing alright here. Just wanted to try a little
more cheer. =)

Love,
Will
