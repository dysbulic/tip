I'm back in Kiffa. I left Aioun two days ago with Pascal, a Frenchman
who works with the Ministry of Education. We did the three hours to
Kiffa on paved roads and then the three to Kankossa over the dunes. I
got stuck for the first time in Mauritania when the ruts in the sand
were so deep that the car was stranded on the hump in the middle. We
dug it out though and continued on our way.

I was hoping to get to spend a little time in Kankossa and visit, but
unfortunately the volunteers I was going there to visit were leaving
the next day, so I just got to wander a bit and had to leave. Kankossa
is a pretty city. There is a big lake on one side and a standing dune
on the other. 

I did get a nice tour of reportedly the two most interesting places in
Kankossa: the garden and the slaughter yard. The garden really was
impressive. I've been to Rinjau outside of Ka.di which is bigger, but
most of what grows there are trees. The garden here had just about
every type of plant I've seen in this country. Everything from
eggplants to habeneros to cabbage and moringa. I had lunch with the
gardener who was a really entertaining old guy named Yaya.

The slaughter yard was interesting in a more morbid sense. It was
after hours so all there really was to see were many many piles of
bones and hooves and horns and the occasional discarded skin. We did
run across a group of cats devouring a cast aside fetus which, along
with the pervasive scent of blood, gave the whole experience a surreal
post-apocalyptic feel. A sense that was broken a bit when I was asked
to take a picture of the volunteer I was with alongside her young
Mauritanian friend and a pair of horns perched on her head.

Kankossa was fun though. Another first was I got to pull water from
the well. The "bucket" is just a piece of a tire inner tube stitched
closed. As resilient as you would think that would be I managed to
break the stitching on mine and had my water pulling privileges
revoked. Even reduced to a mere water bearer I couldn't really do the
job properly since as a guy it isn't kosher for me to carry stuff on
my head in true water bearer fashion (and as my friend was doing).

It is difficult for me to come up with an adjective with sufficient
descriptive depth to describe my ride back to Kiffa. Hmm. How about
"suck?" As in "my ride sucked donkey balls." Yeah, it is a bit subdued,
but you get the idea. For those of you who know Wayne, his truck is a
Dodge Dakota. It is a pretty standard size (half ton?) pickup truck
and about the same size as a Toyota Hilux. How many people would you
imagine could reasonable be expected to ride in the back of a truck
that small? Ten? Ten seems a bit much doesn't it? Well how about
twenty? Four sitting on the tailgate, three sitting on top of the cab,
five along each side and three in the middle. You think perhaps that I
am mistaken as to the size. That it was bigger than a half size
truck. If it is was it wasn't by much.

A lesson learned about riding in a truck like this is don't pack
breakable things. First they throw in all the luggage then the pile in
all the people on top and packed in like sardines as they are there is
no place to sit but on the luggage.

I still get the sense you think I am exaggerating. You know those
pictures you see of boats coming over from Cuba with people literally
spilling over the sides or you hear of a bus crash in India which
somehow kills a hundred and fifty when the bus was only big enough
hold thirty? This is the reality of third world travel and not the
exception.

There is a school of meditation which says "it doesn't matter what you
do so long as it hurts. Follow your pain and control how you respond
to it." Well, I got to practice that alot. Unfortunately my butt was
sitting on my backpack (compressible) and my feet were on the spare
tire in the middle of the car (noncompressible). So, little by little
the side of the truck got to work its way over half my vertebra as my
ass worked its way lower and lower. I ended up with my knees touching
my chest and today the lower half of my back is a bruise.

Ok, but enough whining. It sucked, as I mentioned, but I made it in
alive and well. We had a couple volunteers whose were in a truck that
rolled a couple weeks ago so things could have been much worse.

I'm going to do it again on Sunday. The Peace Corps car will be going
though Kankossa and I can catch it there to get a ride back to
Nouakchott. This time though I'm riding up front. It costs an extra
500um, but for the three hour ride across the dunes it is a $1.50 I am
well worth. =)

Anyhow my internet connection is sporadic for the moment and will
continue to be for a bit. I ought to return to the big city in another
four or five days. Until then I'll do my best to keep in touch.

Hope all is well for you and yours.

Love,
Will
