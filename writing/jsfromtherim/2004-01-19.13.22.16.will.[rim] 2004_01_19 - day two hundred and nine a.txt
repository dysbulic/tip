Well, I rolled back into town from Aioun today. I was unfortunately not
much help to those there since I was sorely afflicted with a really bad
case of the flu about two days in. I slept for about three days straight
and then lay about reading for a couple more before catching a ride back
to Nouakchott with Obie.

We stopped in Maal and I may or may not have fixed their computer. 
Tomorrow and the solar panels having time to do their magic will tell.

I still have a nasty cough and headache, but I am awake for periods of 
time longer than three hours which is an improvement.

Read two books I enjoyed. One was Good Omens by Terry Prachett and Neil 
Gaiman. Very much in Douglas Adams' style and an entertaining read. The 
other was The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. It was also 
a captivating read I though. Part of what I liked was just that it was set 
during the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, but the characters also 
interested me as well.

So far as the relationship stuff goes with me I did some thinking there 
too. There is one part in The Lightness where Sabina is talking about how 
precious her privacy is to her. That when one knows that they have an 
audience they alter their behavior whether they want to or not. I got mail 
from Steph chastising me for posting a link to her blog here since she 
doesn't know who will read it (and isn't comfortable with some of the 
people she knows will). I really liked what she wrote though because it 
was so angry and so passionate. She is pissed with me and she has every 
right to be. I mistakenly believed that she was so pissed she didn't care 
who knew and that was incorrect.

She took the really pure ones off and there are some new ones that are 
still good, but there is a definite awareness of audience I think. I'll 
readily admit that a detailed description of all the delectable datable 
dreamboats she runs into on a Saturday night is certainly a hand well 
played and it certainly strings. It bites at my insecurities though which 
I can let go of much easier than an assault on my self-absorption which 
hit much truer.

She posted a letter I sent to her a while back which is a good read 
though. I want to talk about it a bit, but I'll wait till I try and do the 
whole story. If I drag my sickened ass out of bed tomorrow I'll do it 
then.

Love,
Will

P.S. Do I seem vengeful to anyone? I feel that way almost. Like I should 
be more snippish about Steph or morose or something. This relatively calm 
resolution (as in resolve rather than completion) was always, I felt, much 
more disheartening to her because she interprets it as a lack of caring. I 
suppose though that this is an unfortunate aspect of my personality and 
the best I can do is learn to live with it.
