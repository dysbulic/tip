That was quite an experience... Rhonda had an armoire that was as tall
as me and which weighed probably around 150lbs. We couldn't get it
down the stairs, so we threw it off the second story balcony. That was
fun. I was really grateful to the driver because it is 97+ outside and
he can't drink water until the end of the day. If it were me I'd be
hiding in the air conditioning all day.

There were four pieces there and it would be nice to divvy them up
fairly among the volunteers here in town. (You'd think since I'm
devoting my time to helping people and stuff that I'd be nice and
fair.) As it is I have the bookshelf and armoire, Matt has the bed and
Carl has the chest of drawers. Jay is contesting the chest and I fear
if he gets it that Carl is coming after my armoire. I'm mostly hoping
that everyone will find places and forget about all of it. =) The
bookshelf they will have to pry from my cold dead fingers.

At the end I was expressing my thanks to the driver and he told me
that in Africa you couldn't ask for a gift, but if someone offered
you one one you couldn't refuse. =) I wonder what a good gift would
be...

Love,
Will
