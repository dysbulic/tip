This is a journal from the last center days before site visit. I took 
notes during our sex talk of some of the statistics and wanted to share.

One of the big parts of our talk was sex and apparently last year 4 PCV's 
contracted HIV. Generally 80% of HIV conversions (a conversion being going 
from negative to positive on the test) are in Africa. This is likely 
because 1/3 of all Africans have HIV though the numbers are much higher in 
South Africa than here. It is difficult to get accurate statistics in 
Mauritania because many people would literally rather die than revel that 
they have it, but guesses are around 5%.

She cited 11,000,000 orphans from HIV deaths, 6,000,000 conversions last 
year and 3,000,000 deaths. I can't even imagine what things are like in 
South Africa.

PCV's apparently rapidly run out of things to do in country and resort to
the oldest pastime. In post-service surveys, 90% of PCV's reported being
sexually active within 20 months, and as one current PCV here put it "the
remaining aren't necessarily by choice." =) 40% reported sexual 
relationships with Host Country Nationals (HCN's) and 25% reported activity 
within the first month of service. Less that 30% reported consistent 
condom usage.

The PC Medical Officer (PCMO) giving the training told the story of how in 
one site where they had a HIV conversion they had to test 60% of the 
volunteers in the track-back. She called the last two months "a rabbit 
warren."

The other thing that was stressed was tuberculosis. There was 1.2% 
conversion rate for TB last year. Apparently about 95% of TB cases are 
asymptomatic, and a walled over place simply forms in the lungs trapping 
the TB bacteria. China is apparently the place to go for TB both because 
the population is so dense and spitting in public is socially acceptable.

Mortality rates are down. 24/10000 in 1981 and only 6/10000 in 2000. So 
it's not very likely I'll come back dead. =) There is a book of statistics 
called "The Heath of the Volunteer" that I want to try and get an 
electronic copy of because it is really interesting. It is the companion 
to "The Safety of the Volunteer" which has crime statistics.

The breakdown for 2000:
  1.5/10000 - Homicides
  0.6/10000 - Medical Problems
  0.0/10000 - Suicides
  3.6/10000 - Accidental Injuries

We ended with a thoroughly sobering video where four PCV's who contracted 
HIV told their stories.

Love,
Will
