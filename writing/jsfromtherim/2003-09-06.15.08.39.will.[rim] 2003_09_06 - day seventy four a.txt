Today was a busy day. There is a girl who visits sometimes who is
going to the model school. I've tried to explain a couple different
ideas to her. My French and her English usually manage to meet
somewhere in the middle. Well, I ran into her on the street a couple
days ago and she invited me over for dinner. I took a raincheck for
Saturday and sure enough she happened by around noon today.

This was not such a good day in the health department. I managed to,
in order of increasing disturbingness:
  3. Drink zreig (the sugar and milk drink) with oil can milk
  2. Eat rice prepared with diesel fuel can cooking oil
  1. Drink a very "healthy" quantity of Ka√©di water

Regardless though I was nowhere near the disturbing sight for the day
which was a small child picking at and eating bits of the raw meat for
lunch. I'm going to talk to my facilitator and find out what the mores
are surrounding yelling: "For the love of God child, don't do that."
It is certainly what I would have done back home.

I enjoyed the day though. I already am battling diarrhea, so I figured
I'd just make it worse. =) I also didn't have any real choice other
than leave and go to a boutique for water. It was sort of my going
away extravagance. Some people splurge and buy nice things, I consume
potentially hazardous foodstuffs. =)

It was cool to talk to a younger person. This girl is 18 and two years
out from taking the Bac. The Baccalaureate is an aspect of the French
educational system. It's pretty much a big test, sort of like the SAT.
The difference is that if you "pass" then you get to go to university
pretty much free of charge. Likewise if you don't pass (and I think
"passing" is being in a certain percentage rather than getting an
actual score) then you are almost certainly not going to university.

I talked to her some both about being young and being female in
Mauritania. She thinks that times are changing quite a bit and in fact
painted a rather different picture for the life of a woman in
Mauritania that Habib did. I am guessing this is a combination of him
being from the more conservative North and also just being less
connected to the lives of women.

She said though that if a man wanted to marry her then she would have
to consent or it wouldn't go through. They her family was important,
but not more important than her. Also that for a happy life it is
necessary for both the partners to want to marry each other.

Her aspiration is to study and pass the Bac and then go to America to
study. She said she wants to make money to help her family. I asked
her what she wanted to study and she said law maybe.

It really is true that simply being in America generally means making
some serious money for a Mauritanian. The minimum wage is $5.15 I
think and when you convert that to ougia it is well over the daily
salary for most people.

When I talk about money I always try to emphasize that stuff is more
expensive in America. It is unarguably true though that the standard
of living is alot higher in the States. I discovered today that this
is the same family that has the girl with the deformed feet. They
actually asked me if there are people like that in the U.S. and I had
to say that generally problems like that are repaired when people are
infants.

I really don't know where the line lies between bragging and simply
being honest. I am really finding it difficult to talk about my
country and not put it up as better than Mauritania. I actually really
enjoyed the conversation with Habib about race and drugs and
everything because it gave me an opportunity to talk about the fact
that America has some really serious problems.

The question for the day is currently "what is the most serious
problem facing America?"

Love,
Will
