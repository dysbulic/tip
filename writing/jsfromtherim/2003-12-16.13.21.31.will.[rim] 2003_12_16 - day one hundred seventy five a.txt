Well, I am back in town after a hectic trip to Aioun. It is about a 
twelve hour trip out. Our car didn't leave until around 1p.m. so we 
didn't arrive until early in the morning. We were giving a ride back to 
a teacher and two students who just returned from a two week exchange 
with Derby, Kansas. Their American analogues should be showing up here 
in January.

I had my longest French conversation to date as the teacher told me 
about America and Mauritania and just about everything else during our 
twelve hours sitting next to each other. It was cool and I'd say I got 
about 80% of what was going on. My ability to respond was a bit limited, 
but that was ok.

Once there Carl and I worked pretty much all the time. We had two days 
of starting at about 8-9a.m. and going until 10p.m. It was challenging, 
but we managed to make some good progress and got a good picture with 
the place all set up.

Aioun has some really pretty rock formations. I didn't really have time 
to visit them, but hopefully I'll be going back in January.

On the way back we stopped in both Andy's site and Mark's, both of which 
I was really wanting to see. It was specifically because of their 
inaccessibility that we visited. We were delivering satellite telephones 
so that they could be contacted in an emergency.

Mark's place is amazing. It is about 10 little mud huts and a garden. I 
was just awed at Mark and the life that he is living. My life right now 
is different, but not really that different. Mark gets up every morning 
in a town populated by less that 200 people, helps them drag the fish 
nets in, then goes to work in his garden speaking Pulaar all the time 
since that is all anyone speaks. If he would like to visit with someone 
the closest American is Lisa about 20km (12mi) who he can walk to. It 
takes a full 24 hours starting with a 15km walk if he wants to get out 
to the road.

I really want to go visit him for a while. Enough time to really get an 
experience of that way of life. He is supposedly going to try and build 
a well in a bit. If I could go help with that it would be really cool. 
Maybe I could do something about my citified hands.

In other news I rushed back here to find out that my class is now going 
to start on the 20th. It now not only messes up my Christmas plans it 
runs over New Years as well. My last hope is that it manages to flounder 
completely so I am free to go to Saint Louis.

Today has been pretty slow. I ate some sketch mishwi (grilled meat) 
while in Aioun and I've had muscle aches and nausea all day. I hung 
around the university until around noon trying to catch up on work a bit 
but eventually gave up and went home for a nap.

I think I'm going to go resume my napping.

Love,
Will
