Well, this is my last night here. Tomorrow I'll head back to the
center and after that I'll be a volunteer and living in Nouakchott,
inshallah.

Some stuff happened today that really made me appreciate both my
family and Habib more. Before I get to that I want to talk about our
party for our families.

Carl and I went to this market and bought a kilo and a half of crushed
peanuts (something consumed by Sonikes.) Also some jelly and chocolate
and bananas. That was going to be all, but when we talked with our
coordinators their main question was "where's the meat?" So we got
twenty cans of tuna as well.

We sugared, salted and oiled the peanuts to come up with a reasonable
good facsimile of peanut butter. This we combined in various ways on
30 baguettes with the chocolate, jelly and bananas. The peanut butter
and chocolate in particular was to die for. We have all been chaste
for the last two and a half months, but the general consensus was we'd
rather have this than sex. =)

We tried to give some to our host who was complaining about the meat,
but he'd not eat any saying "les arichides n'est pas bon pour le
ventre." (Peanuts aren't good for the stomach.) I wasn't terribly
saddened to have more left for me. =)

With our twenty cans of tuna a drained of the third a can of oil from
each and combined it with some mayo and cut it with cans of mixed
veggies for some semblance of tuna salad. Usually I go with a little
pickle relish in mine, but I've not seen a pickle since I've been
here.

We also got a whole bunch of balbastik, both the besap and another
kind that is brown. I think both are made using hibiscus, but besap
uses red hibiscus and the other white. Half of our budget went to the
purchase of drinks for all of our 90 guests. Everyone had a Fanta or
Sprite of Coke waiting for them though.

Our families and facilitators eventually started trickling in and
around six we all stood up and said where we'd be going and thanked
our families (in French). They they descended on the food and did a
pretty good job of cleaning everything out. I was pleased to see that
the peanut butter sandwiches got the same attention as the tuna.

At the end we had some left over and the local group of kids that
plays basketball at the lyc√©e came by and took care of the remains.
Mohma came (Moussa is still out of town) and I think it worked for
her. I personally enjoyed it and think it was a good evening all
around.

Love,
Will
