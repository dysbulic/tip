Ick, I'm going to talk a bit about my living situation.

It s really frustrating right now because I have a place that works really 
well for me on several axes and it is being held up by what I perceive as 
bureaucracy.

The place that I want to live is the one that I mentioned a couple days 
ago. The main guy is Mohammad ("Med") and he walked around with us for a 
long time apartment hunting. He lives there with his two younger brothers 
and a guy from Guinea and a guy from Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). The Cote 
D'Ivoirian is moving out and so they have a room free.

I really like the guys. It is a great place to get to practice French. 
They cook there so I don't have to go out eating all the time (which is 
already growing old.) I really like the price too; maybe if I work at it I 
could save enough to get to see a little bit of Africa as long as I am 
here. The neighborhood is a pleasant one. (It turns out that I would be 
near embassy people and not PC people.)

The problems are these. I started off by telling Obie that they were 
Liberian. We have to either live by ourselves or with Mauritanians. We 
cannot with with expiates. It actually turns out though that their father is 
Mauritanian, so they are Mauritanians. They spent much of their early life 
in Liberia though and with my hardly working French all that I understood 
was the Liberian part.

(BTW, I keep switching Liberia and Lybia, also Gambia and Guinea. So just 
translate.) =)

I'm only now learning alot of the rules about what it means to be a 
citizen and a national and what-not. If your father was of one nationality 
and your mother another and you were born in a third and married someone 
from a fourth you could conceivably be a citizen of four countries. 
Apparently the terms citizen and national are synonymous. (According to 
Merriam Webster, "national: one that owes allegiance to or is under the 
protection of a nation without regard to the more formal status of citizen 
or subject.") Also, the U.S. doesn't like people to have dual citizenships 
when one of them is American. Reportedly the only allowed ones are Irish 
and German.

I was thinking about living with the family I am with right now, but I had 
a night a couple days ago where I really just wanted to get away from the 
family and the French and everything and the amount of space available was 
very small. That and I really don't feel like they understand when I don't 
want to be around them. There is a sense that I am being unfriendly and 
maintaining that balance I have been talking about between the internal 
and external is very difficult with them so close.

I really do like the idea of living with some locals though. It is going 
to be hard for me to really find people and make friends especially living 
in the city and not speaking French very well. Also, the house is a nicer 
place. There is a toilet and water that works. One other thing that is a 
problem with my host family is that they run the water literally all the 
time to provide for the family. It drips from the faucet and they just put 
buckets under it to collect it all day and night. I can tell that I am 
taxing their water and that bothers me as well.

I guess most of it with the family comes down to difficulty in 
understanding. I don't know how things work here and I don't know how to 
be polite. I feel angry almost because this is really hard and I am trying 
with the French and the culture and everything, and I don't feel like I 
have a clear concept of the PC's expectations and desires.

With the rooming though, I talked to Obie once and he said "no go" because 
I thought they were all expiates. Then I found out they are nationals and he 
said "maybe." Today he told me that Katerie said "no" and I am going in 
about half an hour to talk about why.

I am really frustrated because the other people that live here live by 
themselves and most of the other people who are hunting for a place are 
not looking to live with nationals. I have enough money to live by myself 
and I am very frustrated that my attempts to get better integrated with 
the community, both because I want to have some friends and because I have 
got to practice French, are being stymied.

Maybe it is supposed to be hard like this. Maybe that is what they expect. 
It really doesn't seem like such from what our allowance is. We have 
enough to live like most of the people in this city. Well, most of the 
people who are not living with their family, since I've not got any here. 
The living is nicer here than in the more rural areas, but that is true of 
most cities. The poverty could be worse, but I'm not supposed to be living 
at the level of the most impoverished Mauritanian. I guess I sort of feel 
bad for not just wanting to live wherever. For not liking not having any 
water to bathe in when there's other people who don't either. For wanting 
to sit on a toilet when crapping the entirety of my being out. I really 
just don't how things should be.

Well, I am off to talk to Katerie. More shortly.

Love,
Will
