I'd like to run through my yesterday as it touches on half a dozen
different things going on in my life and was one of my busiest here.

**Warning: long and tedious, feel free to skip since it contains
little important information.

My day begins at 6:45 when my telephone/alarm clock chimes its little
reminder. I haul my butt out of bed, flip the breaker on my water
heater and go back to bed for thirty minutes to give the water time to
heat. It takes an hour for a full shower, but I can get reasonable
damp if I give it half that. Mornings are in the 60's right now and
the water is colder so the heater is a nice thing to have.

I get up and take about eight minutes to rinse off and get ready for
the day. I brush my teeth and hair and get ready to meditate.

I've been doing a thing where each day when I meditate (which I am
doing also for Lent) I mark on my page-a-day calendar that I did it
and I tear off the page. I've gotten a day behind though and so my
calendar is a day off. The way the deal works is that I don't get to
stop with the discipline until both Lent is over and I'm caught up to
the current day.

So I sit and start at the wall for 20 minutes. I'm not especially good
at it currently, but I am (mostly) sticking to it.

It is about 7:45 now and I head out to go to the university. I get
there about 8:00 and write a couple emails. I send one to of one of my
students and ask him to bring some software to class that we were
talking about that might be handy for some of the computer labs I am
working with. I send another to the volunteers in Nouakchott telling
them salmon is too damned expensive and if I am going to put down 15k
on a dinner I'm going to eating barbecued camel, so we are switching
to something else.

About 9:00 I head over to the office and collect some tools for doing
network wiring. After that I head off to the Air Mauritania office and
try to get a return ticket from Aioun to Nouakchott changed to a
ticket for the Tuesday flight from Nouakchott to Aioun.

When I get to the office I am in the closest approximation to a line
that I've seen here. There's two guys sitting on a couch and the usual
throng that surrounds the counter isn't there. Every so often some
random person will walk in and cut up to the counter, but they get
sent off elsewhere. You must understand that here in general lines
don't happen. Everyone just gathers in a big group and the pushiest
people get served first.

There's a white Maure and an African ahead of me. The Maure goes and
finishes his business, but when it is he African's turn he looks at me
and gestures for me to go. I look at the guy at the desk and he is
motioning to me as well. I don't really want to go and try to say so,
but of course this is in French which I don't speak. So I end up
cutting ahead of this guy and feeling guilty about it.

The guy at the desk tells me that I need to wait for another fellow at
another desk because I need to change the direction on my ticket. So,
I hang around for another fifteen minutes and the other fellow shows
up. He tells me that my ticket was purchased through a travel agent
and I have to find them to get the ticket changed.

It is now 9:45 and I was supposed to meet Margaret at 9:45 and so I
call her and tell her I am coming.

I start walking toward her house and en route I stop at the boutique
where I buy CD-RW's. A CD-R here is supposed to be about 350um-500um
($1.20-$1.50). A CD-RW is about double that. I've got one boutique
that has some of both but doesn't know the difference. He is selling
me CD-RW's for 700um, and thinking he is ripping me off for something
that should cost 350um, when he is in fact giving me a good price.
I pick up a CD and continue on my way.

There's a bakery next to the fancy restaurant Le Palmerie. I stop in
and they have something they are calling "honey bread." Sounds
interesting so I buy a loaf for 200um.

I meet up with Margaret and we head out to her bureau at Nissa Bank,
arriving around 10:30. There is a lab out there that was set up poorly
and I spend the next four hours cutting the ends off ethernet cables
and sticking new ones on with the wires in the right order.
Interestingly the cabling is cat6 which is a newer and more expensive
wire. Completely unnecessary for this job, but it ended up here
nonetheless.

At 1:30 I catch a cab back to town and head to Marc's house. I stop
and buy a liter of milk, a kilo of powdered milk and a cup of yogurt.
I combine these into what will hopefully become yogurt in about five
hours.

While there I get a call back from Carl who was at the bureau and I
sent a text message to him asking him to find out where the travel
agent is. He tells me and tells me they should be able to do it no
problem.

It is about 3:00 now and I sit and have some of my bread which turns
out to be honey wheat.

At 3:30 I head out again and go to the travel agents office. Since,
as with most of my other travel, I am on foot, I don't get there until
about 4:00. There is someone in there, but he says they are closed
and I have to come back tomorrow.

So, I go by my house pick up some CD's and then head on to the
university where at 5:00 I meet Carl. I read my email and we work on
a system for doing the installs I will be working on in Aioun until my
students start showing up at 6:00.

The main professor still hasn't been here in three weeks, so I've been
doing labs with them every class. This class was no different. Carl
hung around and after an hour we came up with a shopping list and he
headed off to meet me at Marc's after class.

Class theoretically goes until 8:30, but the exams are online and
people tend to start them late. I can't well kick them out and I have
the key to the door. So, I end up actually leaving at 9:00.

I start walking back toward Marc's, shopping list in hand. I pick up a
couple of kilos of veggies and some bread and finally end up at Marc's
at 9:45.

Carl and I finally start cooking. He is doing pitas and I am doing
cobbler. They were out of camel at the store, so we are just having
beef. He does two awesome sauces though. One uses my yogurt (which
worked, mashallah). It is yogurt, cucumbers, and parsley. The other is
hummus, tahini, cumin, parsley, onions and garlic. Very nice. We have
those with lettuce and tomatoes and the beef sauteed on the pitas. It
is delicious.

My cobbler doesn't fare as well. Marc has a grand total of two pans. We
ended up pouring the yogurt in the water filter jug (there was about
four liters of it). The cobbler was baked in the stock pot.
Untraditional, but it worked. Something happened with my calculation
of the dough and my apple cobbler was mostly lacking cobbler. It was
also too sweet. Covered in the yogurt though to cut the sweetness it
was a dish that I would have actually done on purpose because it was
really tasty.

We started eating around 11:00 and didn't finish until 12:00. I limped
on back home and collapsed. A busy, but productive, day finished. =)

I managed to get my ticket today and head to Aioun at 6am tomorrow.
So, I may disappear for a couple days depending on what is going on
there.

Love,
Will
