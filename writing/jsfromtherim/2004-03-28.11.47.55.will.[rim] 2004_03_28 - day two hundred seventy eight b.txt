This journal has an audio/visual component. Go and watch:

    http://will.mr.pcvs.org/Conan%20O'Brien%20-%20Seinfeld%20Auditions.mpeg

It is a Conan O'Brien skit where they are holding mock additions for a
new Seinfeld. There is an Indian fellow who has a hell of a time with
the word "cornnuts."

That is me pretty much exactly except the word is "yaourt" ("yogurt"
in French). To the best of my knowledge the pronunciation is something
like "yah-wohur." For the life of me though every time I say it people
either don't understand at all (90% of the time) or they laugh at me
and say, "oh, you mean 'yaourt.'" It is frustrating, but unfortunately
making and eating yogurt is one of my favorite things to do here, so
there's little avoiding it.

On a related note, George Mason University has a project with native
speakers of 306 different languages read "an elicitation paragraph
written in English, [which] uses common English words, but contains a
variety of difficult English sounds and sound sequences. The paragraph
contains practically all of the sounds of English."

The paragraph is: "Please call Stella. Ask her to bring these things
with her from the store: Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick
slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. We also
need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. She can
scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her
Wednesday at the train station."

Interesting stuff:
