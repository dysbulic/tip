Along with the whole death thing I've been contemplating my future in
other ways. I've been thinking about the whole life after Peace Corps
bit, what I want that to be like and what I can reasonably expect.

Before I came here I was pretty well settled on trying to find a job
when I got back, saving a bit of money and then heading off to grad
school to hopefully get a Ph.D. and one day teach.

I still really like that idea of teaching. There is something in that
moment when someone sees the reasons why the world works like it does
that gives me a charge. I've actually gotten to do it a couple times
in my classes. There are a variety of things that you do when you are
setting up a network that most of the student have just rotely
memorized. I've gotten to explain how some of them work and seen that
glimmer of understanding in a couple of faces.

At the same time I have been bitten by the travel bug. The idea of
traveling around the world and seeing different ways of life is really
attractive to me. I was watching Lost in Translation the other night
which has scenes of rituals in Buddhist temples in Japan and it was
palpable to me how much I wanted to get to experience them. Living
here has shown me that experiencing a place takes more than a week
living out of a hotel room.

I am thinking maybe after this I might enjoy something like the US
Foreign Service. When I stayed in Dakar I was with a guy who did
security systems installations for the State Department. He showed me
pictures from around the world where he would fly in, work for a few
months and then move on. The idea of living out of a suitcase for the
rest of my life doesn't sound like fun, but traveling for a couple
years is definitely attractive.

Coming out of Peace Corps we get noncompetitive hiring for federal
jobs for a year. That could come in handy.

The one thing that scares me some though is the thought of essentially
postponing my life again. As I touched on a couple of months ago I
really like the idea of having kids and I really like the idea of
getting to know them when they are in their 30's. Gallivanting around
the world would be cool, but other than perhaps saving some money it
doesn't seem to really lie on the path toward my expected goal of a
wife, kids and teaching position somewhere. The idea of putting it off
and putting it off and waking up sixty with the possibility gone
scares me.

The idea of finding a compatible and available woman without
postponing it is intimidating enough.

Something that has changed in the last little bit is what I'd like to
do if I was to go back into software development. My last couple of
jobs have been very autonomous. I've been designer and implementer
both and with the last one in particular I completely fucked it up. I
just did not get it together to meet the deadlines I needed to
meet. It was due pretty much completely to my lack of experience. I
miscalculated my timetables as well as my other time commitments. I
could never make the crucial decision to do a less than perfect job to
get the job done.

I've not done a bit of programming in about two months now. I've got a
couple projects that I started in Stage that I really need to update a
bit, but I've just had a real aversion to getting back into it. For
the longest time so much of my identity has been "computer geek." It
was what I did, what I was good at and, unfortunately, much of why I
thought I was a worthwhile person. Having performed so
unsatisfactorily at my last attempt and being here where I don't have
to do it anymore I've not been quick to get back into it.

I am good at it though. Not a season professional by any means, but in
terms of skill I do pretty well. I do expect to stay in technology
work and very likely software development. My ideal job after this
would be code monkey, maybe even debugger. That is a person who makes
very few decisions, someone else does the design and sets the
deadlines and I work as a part of a team at making them happen. The
thought of doing it all myself is just tiring. I think I'd like the
autonomy at some point, but for now I'm mainly looking to get some
experience.

Doing it in a francophone country would be perfect. The work wouldn't
be hard and I could get more French experience. If it could be first
world that would be especially nice. =)

There's grad school eventually too. I really want to try and get into
a challenging school. TTU is a nice enough school, but I'd already
learned the stuff for most of my classes in my various jobs. I never
felt like I had to struggle especially hard to keep up. It was a good
environment for me emotionally coming, as I was just barely holding it
together at the end of high school. I feel like I am ready to be a
small fish now.

I've got two friends here who did their undergrad at Berkeley. They
recommend it highly. That is currently my first choice both from its
reputation that I already knew and their descriptions of the
environment there. This is the biggest one though where I have
questions about the realism. I have a mediocre undergrad record
(3.3gpa) from a non-prestigious university for CS. I have a couple
local conference presentations with no research and no
publications. All in all I don't see any especially good reason for a
really good school to want me.

I've got a friend at TTU working on a math degree that keeps wandering
toward CS. If I get my drive to write software back before he
graduates (or I leave) I'm thinking about trying to get him to agree
to collaborate on something. I don't want to do it though until I find
my muse again.

Right now I am pretty much not focused on my professional life at
all. Working on getting my head screwed on straight and what I'm
looking for out of my life. I passed the 30% done mark about a week
ago. I figure I can wait till 50% to really start working. =)

Love,
Will
