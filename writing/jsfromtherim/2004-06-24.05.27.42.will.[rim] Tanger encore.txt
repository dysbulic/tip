Not dead still, mashallah. Took the boat back from S?te and sumehow managed
to get a less comfortable but more expensive cabin than going up.

Yesterday I hung out with a Swede I ran into at the train station, J?ren. He
lives in London though and I thought he was British for the longest time. I
went on at length having been a bit pent up on my 36 hour boat ride with no
English speakers.

I got to play tour guide since my half a clue was more than he had. That's
always fun.

I'm off to catch a train and, inshallah, a flight back to Nouakchott tonight.

Lunch yesterday was a half kilo of cherries, a half kilo of peaches and a
kilo of bread. Total cost? (A kilo is 2.2lbs, remember.) $2 I love this
country. So much fruit and delicious breads and pastries and so little time.

Well, the train leave soon, so I ought to be on my way.

Love,
Will
