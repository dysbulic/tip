This setup has been interesting. I am configuring a network with a
windows domain controller and ten workstations. The idea is easy
enough in principle. In practice it has proven challenging.

The problem is the environment. The girls here are generally less
educated than the boys. One of the ways that this plays out is there
are alot more bilingual boys than girls. This also means though that
one of the big things this center is aimed at is ameliorating the
condition of the girls.

My job, therefore, is to try and get all the stuff installed in French
and Arabic. I have mentioned before that windows servers are expensive
and for this reason I don't really have much experience with
them. Here we have one, but it is in French. This means I am getting
to figure everything out with a dictionary at my side.

When asked how things are going my perennial response is "petite Ã 
petite." I really feel like the little Dutch boy. I'll fix one thing
for one program or language and find some new one will have
sprouted. Unfortunately most software designers didn't really take
into consideration environments with multiple languages. Well, most
didn't take into consideration languages other than their own, but
even those who did usually didn't make it easy to switch languages
within an application.

I am also discovering little gotchas like circumstances underwhich I
can get the computer to delete all of a user's files without so much
as a warning. I am also learning how to get them back.

Going through install programs in Arabic is entertaining as well. I
have the advantage of generally having just done it in French, but it
is a challenge nonetheless. Every so often a mystery box will pop up
and I'll just click random buttons until it goes away. I have learned
that "OK" in Arabic is a shorter word than "Cancel." It really is a
pretty language. I need to at least learn how to write my name or
something. Maybe I could learn "God Bless the USA" and then go spray
painting it on stuff back home. That appeals to my sense of irony, or
need for vandalism, one.

Things are progressing though, little by little. It is nice to have
something to do, but at the same time I'm getting the cramps in my
shoulders I've not had since I left the States. I think for future
work I am going to list regular shoulder massages as a requirement.

Anyhow, back to work. Thanks for listening.

Love,
Will

P.S. I wish I was a painter. That my natural abilities managed to
align themselves with the reparation of these infernal beasts is a
very cruel cosmic joke in my mind. Perhaps when I return I'll pull a
Lester Burnham and settle into a rewarding career at Burger King. I
bet I get free burgers. Yummm, flame broiling...
