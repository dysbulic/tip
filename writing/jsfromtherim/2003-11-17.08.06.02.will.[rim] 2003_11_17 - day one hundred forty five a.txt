Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me...

Amazingly, a ship came in a few days ago with a load of mail from the
states. It costs the PC 400um per package to pick them up. They took
20,000um thinking they'll be fine, but they ended up leaving 20
something because the 50 they got took all their money.

So I had four packages. Kudos to Steph, grandma and Sharon twice. =)
The sugar babies didn't fare especially well (they are now one giant
baby), but I am munching on M&M's as I write.

I think I'm going to go drowse a bit and enjoy my candies. =)

Love,
Will
