Technogeeky message you who don't care about such things may skip...

I have been playing at one of the isp's here...

If you are ever in a Microsoft based environment and you are going though 
a proxy it is possible that you are behind a winsock proxy. This proxy can 
operate just like a normal http proxy which has to be set in the browser 
to be used, or the machine itself can be set up as a winsock proxy client 
and all traffic is forwarded across the proxy.

In the first case I don't think that there is very much that can be done
unless you have some sort of http tunnel software specifically designed
for tunneling ip over http, but if the client is forwarding all traffic
then you can use ssh port forwarding to tunnel across the proxy to
machines that you would like to reach on the other side.

This is particularly useful if you have a linux box which can't be 
configured as a winsock client itself, but which may be running programs 
like fetchmail and rsync that only need to connect to a single host, and 
will run just fine over a ssh port forward.

It is especially nice in a place running dhcp with hubs with free ports 
sitting in unmonitored areas. =)

The one thing that I have as of yet to be able to figure out is how to get
sendmail to work in such an environment. What I wanted to do was use the 
honors server as a smart host relay. It is set to allow relaying for 
localhost (so that people can send mail) and all I did was forward 25 on 
the box that I was on to 25 on localhost. The problem is that sendmail on 
my laptop is bitching because it is trying to resolve the addresses 
(himinbi.org for example) before sending the messages. It can't because 
there is no dns and I can't port forward udp to provide it.

I really don't get why it is trying and need to do a little more reading 
to figure it out.

Being unable to do this though is why I've got week old mail messages
sitting in the queue. I'm going to make a trip tomorrow to another cafe
which isn't proxied.

Will
