So, all is well and good. I managed to catch up with everyone and we have
been happily exploring the French countryside for the last couple days.

Today we went to Bayoux and saw the tapestry as well as a beautiful
cathdreal. These gothic cathedrals have impressed me the most of all so
far. They are just so enormous and ornate that I feel like I sould be
looking for mirrors or some slieght of hand. That they went up almost 1000
years ago boggles the mind.

We started off in Paris and saw the Eiffel tower at night which lived up
to every expectation of picturesqueness. At night they have thousands of
little storbe lights all over the tower that twinkle and are absolutely
beautiful.

Just seeing my family has been the best part of all. We have had lots of
time riding around on the bus for talking and I've really just enjoyed
cathing up and spending time with them. My mom is trying to convince me to
come back straight away after my service. As much of a difference as I
have seen between having travelling companions and not I'm being tempted.

We saw the American cemetary at Nromandy this morning with 9336 marble
crosses. Very sombering. Tomorrow we storm Mont Saint-Michel which we are
staying near tonight.

This really is just great. I have so much to say, but the internet is
5euro a half-hour, so I'm cutting it short.

Love,
Will
