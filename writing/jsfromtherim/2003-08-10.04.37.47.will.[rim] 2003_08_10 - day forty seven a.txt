When I was a kid I used to read Readers' Digest and there was a regular
column called something like "Adventures in Real Life". Every month it
would detail some occurrence that brought forth from those involved acts
of desperation or heroism. Stuff like the lumberjack who chopped his own
leg off and drove himself down the mountain when a tree fell on him.

One story was of a truck driver coming down a long mountain grade and his
brakes fail. This is daunting in and of itself, but as he gains speed he
begins to gain on a small family car also traveling down the mountain. The
road is too narrow to allow him to pass, so the little station wagon must
simply race down the mountain trying to keep ahead of the semi trundling
along behind. I remember the driver's vivid descriptions of the terrified
looks of the children out the back of the car as he bears down on them.

I was remembering this story last night about three in the morning after I
learned that given the impetus a person's bowels can be loosed much like
that semi without its brakes. I lost all control and knew only that I must
try and get my pants out of the way of the load careening through my
system. I had no more power to stop it than the driver of the station
wagon over the tractor trailer.

Interestingly, I have been good with my water too. Through center days
(the previous 4) it was all filtered and it's been the same here (the last
2.) I suppose it just speaks to the fact that caution can only do so much.  
I don't feel very bad though. The first really bad spat of diarrhea really
brought me to my knees (figuratively.) This time other than learning that
going straight from sleeping to squatting for 15 minutes leads to leg
cramps I'm feeling pretty good. Hopefully this will be a one time thing.  
Inshallah.

Love,
Will
