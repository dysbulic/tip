Finished a couple more books in the last few days and want to review
them...

On the way down to Dakar I finished up Sophie's World by Jostein
Gaarder. I started off not liking it because I thought the dialog
was contrived. About three quarters of the way through the author
pulled an entertaining switch and I was quite pleased with the ending.

The book has ostensibly two primary facets, one is as a brief history
of western philosophy, the other as a chronicle of the life of a young
girl and her experience of the history. I think that as a history it
is as engaging as one can expect a written history of philosophy to
get. As a story, I enjoyed the characterization and was really getting
into it at the end.

I'd recommend the book to someone interested in philosophy or for
someone willing to hang on though some philosophy for an really
creative twist of plot.

My other book was The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. I also enjoyed
it, though not as much as Sophie's World. Honestly I was reading Eco
in order to be reading Eco. I started Foucault's Pendulum a while back
and it eventually defeated me. Having finished The Rose I have the
sense that though I managed to read all the words I was still not the
victor.

The exterior story is simple enough save the occasionally arcane
vocabulary. I could see certain themes appearing over and over though
and I couldn't piece together if there was a pattern to the timing or
their relative placement. Or rather there seemed to be a pattern, but
I couldn't decipher it.

Regardless, it was an entertaining read. It has quite a bit of what I
am assuming is accurate historical information. The theological debates
are also pretty entertaining. I like quick wit and banter, and the
characters are good at debate.

Eco is writing in the style of a monk and did a good job of capturing
the feel for the writing style. An unfortunate side effect for me was
that I found it fairly difficult to identify with the characters
because the descriptions tended toward the physical/analytical rather
than the sociological/emotional. In reading the postscript where Eco
discusses his goals as an artist (which was at least as interesting to
me as the book), he focuses on keeping himself as author out of the
interpretation of the story. I wonder if this focus wasn't also
responsible for the writing style. He has no access to the inside of
the characters minds save the narrator's and does little positing save
what the narrator would know.

I learned yesterday that the book was made into movie with Sean
Connery a few years ago. Unless, like me, you have a personal quarrel
with Eco or if you are looking to get deeper into the theology the
movie would likely be the most amusing avenue.

Love,
Will
