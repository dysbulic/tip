I ran across a link to some articles on peace corps safety in the blog 
of an (now ex) volunteer from Samoa:

USA Today: "Peace Corps security in question"
Jane: "The Peace Corps Never Warned Me what I was Really in For"

   http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/2016689.html

Honestly, my take on it is that the Peace Corps generally does a pretty 
good job with safety. I do live in Mauritania though and this is a 
pretty safe country. The likelihood I'll be hit by a car is several 
thousand times more than that I'm be murdered.

One article talks about forced taking of larium (and the associated side 
effects of larium). That part is decidedly not true, it is true they 
will send you home for not taking an anti-malarial, and that larium does 
have mental side effects in certain people. It is also true though that 
they will switch you to doxycyclene (which is taken daily rather than 
weekly) and that the side affects of larium are more pronounced in 
people who already had a susceptibility to mental illness.

I think putting it down as "forced medication" is true but an unfair 
slant. There was a volunteer who cos'ed in the last couple years, 
stopped taking the larium, didn't take the cycle they give you to kill 
off the malaria and died back in the States.

As for most of physical security, they try. They agree to improve the 
security of one house for you. Put bars on the windows or whatever. We 
have started doing site locater forms now where you have to go out and 
list where exactly you live. They even are taking a GPS around and 
getting the actual coordinates of everyone.

We do live in remote places though and many of the problems are just par 
for the course in countries which lack basic infrastructure. Also, the 
volunteers themselves sometimes make it hard. Apparently the last few 
people who have been administratively separated here have had it happen 
because they snuck off to take a vacation and not have to lose the days. 
Along the river it is particularly attractive to sneak off to Senegal 
for a bit. (Which is completely forbidden.)

They make a weekly round of calls to all the sites and here at least 
everyone has a telephone. Out in the bush people have satellite phones 
and some places have shortwave radios. (Mauritanian law prohibits them 
from having transmitters, but they can receive.)

Anyhow, I feel like they try. It does show in the bureau that there is 
alot of administrative stuff that comes in from Washington. It is an 
extension of the beaurocracy of the American government, but all in all 
they do pretty well.

Love,
Will
