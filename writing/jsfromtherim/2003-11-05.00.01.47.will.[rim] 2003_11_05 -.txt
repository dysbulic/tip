Things have been real busy the last couple days and I've not gotten to
write. The election is starting to heat up and every so often we get
calls along the lines of "don't go near the stadium there's a
demonstration."

There have been several for different condidates. Marc was telling me
the story yesterday when there were a couple thousand people marching
between where he ate lunch and the bureau. He had to choose between
wading through the crowd or just sitting for however many hours it
took them to go on their merry way.

Supposedly the police raided the house of one of the candidates the
night before last and sized some guns. There are a wide variety of
people upset about this. Either the people whose candidate was raided
or those whose opposition has guns.

I am headed out of town in about two hours. I'll be back at some
point. In the interim I'll more than likely be off email completely.
So, don't fret I am safely squirreled away far off from any danger (or
electricity).

It all goes well with the elections then I'll be back on the 12th. If
not I'll be back at some point. =)

Love,
Will
