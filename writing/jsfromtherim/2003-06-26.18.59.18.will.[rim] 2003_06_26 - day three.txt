6:00am - Last night was interesting. I went out and explored the streets 
for several hours. There are lots of little shops and places to eat all 
over the downtown. Along the Delaware river there is a very nice walk 
which connects a couple parks. I tried out my new cheap digital camera 
(which, I verified last night, thankfully talks to the computer.) The 
pictures look a little pixelated, but hopefully that's just the little 
screen on the camera and the screen on the laptop. I'll find out more 
soon.

As I was going back to the hotel I ran into April, Andy and Charlie.
They were headed to a place called Dave and Busters which is an "adult
Chuckie Cheeses." It was in an old warehouse and there were about 20
pool tables and a huge arcade. I played some pool and surprisingly won
both games.

People I met were:

April, who is a construction worker. She is most the the way through
an anthropology degree, but her entrance into the PC is based on
having 5+ years of construction experience. We talked for a bit about
cabin building and roofing. =)

Andy, who is doing agro-forestry. His major was geography. He and Matt
Mills are runners and both went jogging earlier. He was leading the
way to Dave and Busters since even though it was about two miles away
they had run past it. He was really cleaning up at pool initially, but
somehow the game got away from him.

Jason, who is another ICT worker. He is 28 and is a funny fellow. He
is the Spanish major with a concentration in French. He looks pretty
young and I was surprised to discover that he is 28. I played my
second round of pool with him and he took it easy on me. He said that
managing one of the womens' centers was something that he was
interested in, but he thought that Lisa (who is apparently a sixth ICT
volunteer I have not met) may be the only one who is allowed to do
that sort of work.

Karl, who has dubbed himself "Good Karl, the one with a K, not evil
Carl with a C" was there. He is the one that I visited the liberty
bell with.

Annika, who I trash talked some during a pool game, but just realized
I know remarkable little about. =) Actually, I do know that her whole
name I Annika Louise Assue DeSomething. I kept calling her Anita and
she corrected me "Annika, like Monica without the M." Apparently the
name is Swedish.

Stephanie, whose name should be easy to remember. She has a hell of a
background. Environmental engineer from MIT. She also sings in operas
and was talking about the last one she did was in non-transliterated
Russian, so she had to learn to read Cyrillic to sing the piece. It
made me long again for an environment like MIT where they'd just plunk
down impossible things in front of me and expect me to pick them up
and go with them.

Audrey, from the plane was there. Also, someone named Margaret who I
didn't talk to and I guys named Dan, Dana and Angus. All I know about
Angus is that he is a Texan with the accent to back it up. =)

Another girl I didn't talk to much was Julia. I remember her name
though from the training. We did a "cross-cultural exercise" where
they took half of us outside and told us to be open and friendly: look
people in the eye, give them a firm handshake and leave them their
room. The other half stayed inside and was told to be warm and
comfortable: make lots of physical contact, defer your eyes as a sign
of respect (which is done in Mauritania apparently) and don't be
audaciously loud. They then mixed us all together and then polled us
as to our impressions. Julia (a quiet one) said that they seemed
scared of her because they kept backing away and Chris wrote on the
board "scared of Julia" as one of the characteristics of the
gregarious bunch. As we were going back through and each side got to
defend itself I quipped that "while we weren't loud, distant or crude;
Julia certainly can be intimidating at times." So Julie is the
intimidating one.

(That was alot of telling for that little story.)

Anyhow, I am going to go try and find some stamps and a phone. Maybe
I'll manage to get his stuff sent out soon.

Love,
Will
