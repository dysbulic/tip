Omar is gone. I just learned recently that he wasn't the child of
Moussa and Mohma. Rather he is the son of Moussa's sister. Well,
yesterday Mohma told me that Moussa and Omar had gone to Nouakchott to
return him to his family there. I was saddened because I really liked
the kid. If I had known he was leaving I would have gotten him a
present or something.

My French is getting a little better and I have learned in the past
couple days both that Omar got here only about a month before I did
and that there was a trainee who lived here last year. They don't
remember diddly other than she was a she and she may be living in
Nouakchott now. What she was studying or what she wanted to do is a
mystery. Her being in Nouakchott is iffy since the only volunteers in
Nouakchott are third years except for Kristen.

I think I mentioned child labor before. Generally if you think of any
kids within seeing distance or who are related to you as your slaves
then you're doing well. You need something washed, find a kid to do
it. You need the floor swept? Kid. Need some cigarettes? Kid. Pretty
much any labor that they are capable of doing it is permissible to ask
of them.

I actually just used Omar for the first time to send him to the store
to buy me some cookies the night of my presentation. Yet another
reason I was sad to see him go. =)

So, all we have for kids is the baby. He's cute. He is at the rather
pleasant sit/lie and flail while smiling stage. Unfortunately he is
also afflicted with a cold right now so he oozes various colors of
mucus from different orifices in addition to the regular compliment of
drool. If I could clone him I think I could marked him as a diet aid
because the spasms of gurgled hacking do wonders for relieving the
appetite.

And on the subject of food, I don't know what the hell happened or who
the hell it happened to, but it somehow ended up being served to me
for dinner last night. It seemed like warm baby food spinach, except
it had bones in it. I ate a few bites of mystery mush and then
declined the rest, saying I was too fatigued to eat.

Love,
Will
