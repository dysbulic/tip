So, I am walking over to the Chinese place (which has a special PC menu)  
with volunteer Naruth last night. A taxi comes toddling along at probably
15mph when the front tire just falls off as he passes us. =) It was a nice
touch of the surreal for the day.

I read the online journal of a past volunteer named Trey Carr (94-96) and 
really got the sense of a two year long acid trip. It didn't sound like 
moving to Africa as much as it sounded like moving to dimension x.

Speaking of links I played this afternoon collecting a few I've fun across 
into one place: http://odin.himinbi.org/mauritanians/links.html

The most interesting one is http://nouakchott.com which is an English
language news site with more news on it than I have seen anywhere. I
learned there that the world heath organization is reporting an outbreak
of haemorrhagic fever somewhere in the country. Sounds like fun. =)

Actually there are only two WHO outbreak alerts in the archive (which go 
back to 2000) and they are both for this fever.

Love,
Will
