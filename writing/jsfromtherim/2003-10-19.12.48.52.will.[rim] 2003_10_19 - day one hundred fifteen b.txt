Among the places we went shopping today were the Marché Capitol and the 
Marché Cinqieme. While out in the cinquieme, Miriam decided to get a rug 
for her dirt floor in Djajibine. We went to the row where they sell 
matelas and rugs and she found a nice little rug she liked and the guy 
wanted 25k for it.

She only had 10k to pay, but she liked the rug and told the guy she'd 
come back later and pay for it. We went through a few minutes of him 
showing us various rugs and trying to convince her, and eventually we 
broke away and got out of the store.

The price that he came down to on the rug was 20k before we left the 
store. He followed us along outside of the store and as we passed other 
stores he would go in and and show us different rugs and offer them to 
us at various prices. Miriam stayed firm and kept telling him she'd come 
back some time later.

He wanders off back to his store, but after a couple minutes he comes 
running up and tells us he'll sell her the rug she wanted for 10k. We 
wander back to the store and when we get there he argues with some 
fellow sitting on a couch for a bit and tells us he'll sell it to us for 
15k.

At this point the guy has been working the sale for about 20 minutes and 
we are all getting a little tired of the whole situation. Miriam says 
fine and borrows 5 from Jen and I and pays the guy. I went in and got 
the rug for her and we go on our way.

We make it about ten minutes away and the guy comes running up to us and 
tells us that his boss won't let him sell the rug for 15k, and he needs 
another 5. Miriam is about ready to hit him and even I, who has a pretty 
high tolerance for irritation, am tired of the situation. He doesn't 
have the 15k with him though, so she can't trade back. He wants her to 
go back with him, but she's not going anywhere. So, I agree to go back 
so as to guarantee that she doesn't run off with his rug.

We make it about ten steps and he says to me, "well, I could take 2k and 
let her have it for 17." I tell him, we are all very tired of this, just 
give me the 15 back. He then turns back around and walks back to Miriam 
and makes the same offer of an additional 2 to her. She is moments away 
for hitting her and tells him to just give her her money back. At this 
he leaves us finally and we hurry away before he has a chance to try 
anything else.

As with most things this is all in French of course. So take all the 
already irritating things and add the frustration of not being able to 
tell someone to go fuck themselves (or much of anything else). =)

As always though, an interesting experience.

Love,
Will
