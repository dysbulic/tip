I'm working on a list of books for my mom to bring to me in Paris. So
far I've got:

Neil Stephenson - _Cryptonomicon_
   Already read _Snowcrash_, liked it and heard this was a good book.

Ken Wilbur - _Sex, Ecology and Spirituality_
   Read some essays by Wilbur which were interesting. I've been
   hunting for this book for a while which I heard described as an
   extended form of _A Brief History of Everything_.

David Payne - _Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street_
   Started this before I left, was getting into it and left it sitting
   on top of the car when I left Cookeville. It is now somewhere along
   the side of the road much to my disappointment.

David Richo - _How to be an Adult_
   A couple people were reading this before I left. Looked pretty
   fundamental, but also perhaps insightful.

Benjamin Hoff - _Tao of Pooh_ / _Te of Piglet_
   Want to try and firm up my understanding up Taoism a bit. I have
   listened to the _Tao of Pooh_ and liked Hoff's synopsis using the
   painting of the three philosophers.

_American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language_
   My already struggling grasp of the English language is slowly being
   weakened by the degenerative influence of French. There are lots of
   French dictionaries here, but not English.

GRE Study Guide
   Need to take this before I come back. According to the news all the
   jobs will be in India by the time I come home. I either need to get
   in a good grad school or learn Hindi.

John Gribbin - _Schroedinger's Kittens_
   Read _In Search of Schroedinger's Cat_ a little while ago and liked
   it. This is supposed to cover the twenty years since the first was
   written.

Robert Bly - _Iron John_
   I am reading _Fire in the Belly_ by Sam Keen right now and really
   liking it. I'd like to have some other sources to compare to and
   this is one of the canonical books on "men's liberation."

John Gray - _Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus_
   I expect for this book to drive me crazy. Gray's positions are
   almost diametrically opposed to my own, but I feel like I ought to
   read it and respond to it for thoroughness sake.

Don Richard Riso - _Personality Types_
   This is an enneagram book recommended to me by my uncle as very
   educational. I've not looked at any more than the basics of the
   enneagram thinking I'd just find a restatement of the MBTI, but
   given the strength of the recommendation I want to give it a read.

Daniel Boorstin - _The Discoverers_
   This is a big fat book that has been sitting on my shelf for a
   while and it seems like now would be a good time to read it.

Martin Buber - _I and Thou_
   I am thinking this book deals with the concepts of dialectical
   and dialogical thinking. They are concepts I have a fuzzy feel for,
   but would like to learn more about.

James Joyce - _Ulysses_
   Much like Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_ this was one of those which I
   attempted and kicked my ass. I've got time for a rematch now.

Albert Camus - _The Stranger_ (in French)
   This book is used alot in intermediate French classes for learning.
   I already own it in both languages, so I figure I'll practice with
   it.

Jean Paul Sartre - _The Wall_ / _No Exit_
   I have had Sartre's _No Exit_ recommended to me. I've never read
   anything by him and always figured it would be too thick for me.
   I'm willing to try though.

Coleman Barks - _The Essential Rumi_
   I like Rumi's writings and have had a couple poems come to mind I'd
   like to be able to reread.

Herman Hesse - _Magister Ludi_
   I know nothing about this book other than having liked _Siddhartha_
   and it is in the third tier of the mentor reading list:
      http://odin.himinbi.org/reading_list/mentor_reading_list.html

Roberts et al. - _A Saint in the City_
   When you are in Senegal there are pictures of Amadou Bamba painted
   all over the place. This book was recommended by a cousin of mine
   and it is on his life. Ahh, in looking up the author I find the
   subtitle is "Sufi Arts of Urban Senegal." It makes sense though I
   never thought of it. Divergent religious leader causing
   transformative experiences in his followers; could easily be a
   mystic. In predominately Islamic West Africa; probably a Sufi.

Andrew Harvey - _The Essential Mystics_
   Another one of those I own and never got around to reading. More in
   the general spirituality vein.

That's where I stand right now. If anyone has any suggestions for
interesting things to read, or if I'm confused on the nature of any of
these books, let me know.

Also, does anyone have suggestions on what they would consider to be a
children's story that captures a good picture of American life. I am
working on the translation of _Raja: Le Chamelon_ into English. It's a
children's book by a Mauritania detailing the adventures of a baby
camel as he voyages across the desert. I'd eventually like to try and
take a story the other way (which is orders of magnitude more
difficult). Doing a story about America would let me share it with
people here wanting to some English and make it more interesting.

Love,
Will
