A cannery is a type of low fired pottery that is porous allowing water to
seep slowly though. This, it seems, would be a problem. Ahhh, but in the 
desert the escaping water evaporates taking some heat in the process and 
cooling the remaining water.

I am pretty sure that my "shower" this morning came from a cannery because 
it was quite chilly. I had a new Mauritanian experience and in the balmy 
88 degree Nouakchott morning with my chilled shower I was actually cold 
for the first time. =)

This is quite different from the supper I had which was made with some 
extremely recently cooked rice. The cooking of rice requires boiling as I 
am sure you all know, so when someone takes a quantity of very freshly 
cooked rice and sticks their fool hands into it, they, not surprisingly, 
get burned.

Somehow my host family seemed largely immune. I also however see them 
regularly handling the little pieces of charcoal used in cooking. They'll 
get tossed out of the little stove and they just pick them up and put them 
back in.

Me and my damned tender white boy fingers.

Speaking of the tea, I don't think I mentioned my learning to make it. 
Maybe I did. Anyhow, things I learned are the thought of iced tea borders 
on the profane (for Habib at least) and the pouring it back and forth 
isn't for cooling, it is to put a head on the tea. Really, tea sans le 
mousse (tea without foam) just doesn't taste right (apparently.)

There is a video of our tea making endeavors (Habib having to pick up the 
pot (again with the fingers)) and I'll get it up before too long 
hopefully. If nothing else it may be possible to get connected through the 
bureau.

Speaking of pain, I am, as they say, crusin' for a brusin'. Not only did I 
have my nice salad last night I had a neat slushie sort of thing this 
afternoon at Robert's house. It was, as best Matt was able to glean, 
produced by washing the leaves of something and soaking them in strawberry 
juice. To make matters worse I am drinking my water without the bleach 
(though still filtered.) There are several drinks prepared locally 
including one with milk and sugar that I can't drink until I can consume 
some water without fear of death.

So, when I write complaining of my impending demise; know that it was my
own fault. =)

We had too many language hours and we had to cut some of them. It may be a 
secret though, so don't tell anyone. =) We have a whole bunch of TDA's 
though that take up all of our mornings and the last few days will be our 
working on teaching a class as a project, so to get the required language 
in we would start sometime around 3 and go for about 6 hours a day. Not 
really reasonable.

Love,
Will
