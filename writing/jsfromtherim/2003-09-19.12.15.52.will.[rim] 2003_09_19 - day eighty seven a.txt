I was talking to Steph the other night and she was mentioning the
changing of the seasons. I had perhaps my most nostalgic longing to
date as I remembered walking around campus as the leaves were changing
and there is the autumn crispness to the air. It is one of my favorite
times of the year, and I won't be seeing it for a while.

I understand that we do have seasons here. We are currently coming out
of the hot season and heading into the rainy season. This means that
we can expect more sandstorms and balmy 85 degree temperatures. I've
become pretty acclimated to the temperatures though. I'm pretty
comfortable sitting around at 90-95 so long as it isn't very humid.

What I'm really looking forward to is the cold season where we'll have
the 80 degree temperatures, but not the sandstorms.

I'm saddened though at the loss of autumn. I've been reminiscing about
stuff like pumpkin carving and trick or treating. I suppose I could
have little ceremonies to commemorate them, but without the leaves
crunching underfoot and the sight of my breath in the night air it
will be a body missing its soul.

I figure the nostalgia for various things will get worse over the next
little bit. I've been running around so much during stage that I
didn't really have time to think about how my life was changing. Now
that things are slowing down I figure the time to sit and think will
accumulate as well.

In particular I'm at a point in between leaving my home in the States
and beginning to feel comfortable enough here to call this place home.
I figure I'll be whining quite a bit over the next three months and
hopefully I can find ways to deal with it without too much pain. =)

Love,
Will
