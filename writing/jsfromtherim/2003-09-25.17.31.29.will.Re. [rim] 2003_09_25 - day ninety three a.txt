Oops, yeah. I am sitting at a XP box port ssh'd into my laptop. There
is another ssh session to the honors server port forwarding smtp and
ssh. I've got a iptables nat which reroutes all traffic to the honors
server to the machine I am sitting on. So, I type my message in mutt
which passes it to sendmail which tries to deliver it to the honors
server as a smart host. The packets get rerouted to the XP box and go
over the port forward.

It is very convoluted, but my connection is really slow here so it was
quicker to come up with a convoluted setup that used existing software
at both ends.

(The proxy between the laptop and the outside is a winsock proxy (not
normal socks compliant) and there is no client software for linux.)

I have a copy of all my web stuff that I rsync every so often. So alot
of the time when checking web stuff I just start apache on my laptop.
I was searching for the video and forgot to change the address once I
found it.

Thanks for pointing it out. I'm running mod_vhost on the webserver,
so the link will work as written, but would normally be:

  http://odin.himinbi.org/mauritanians/will/2003-07-25_05:54:14.mov
