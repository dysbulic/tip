Today was the first day of the end of Ramadan. The way it works is you
wait until you can see the tiniest sliver of moon and that means that
a new (lunar) month has begun. In theory last night one could see some
moon and so Ramadan has ended. So we are now in Shawwal, the first day
of which is Eid Ul Fitr or international visit your friends and party
all night because we aren't fasting anymore day.

I say in theory because supposedly a good deal of Senegal is still
fasting today because they couldn't see any moon. According to the
internet though Mauritania ought to be right though. I didn't look
last night because I didn't know what I was looking for.

The internet also told me that the Muslim calendar is 11 days shorter
than the western calendar and consists of twelve lunar months. It is
called the hijra because it starts on July 16, 622 C.E. when Muhammad
fled Mecca which is also known as the hijra.

(Another calendar note... I suppose most everyone knows, but if you
have not seen it before alot of people use Common Era (C.E.) and
Before the Common Era (B.C.E.) instead of Anno Domini ("In the year of
our Lord") (A.D.) and Before Christ (B.C.).)

For me it was national make a little yogurt, eat Chinese because it is
the only place open, take a nice nap cause there's nothing to do day.
=)

Love,
Will
