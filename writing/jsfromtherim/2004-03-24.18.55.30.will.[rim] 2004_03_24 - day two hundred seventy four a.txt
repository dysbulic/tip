I have been all over this country in the last two weeks. I'm back in
Aioun again trying to get the lab I was working on finished. If all
goes as planned I'll be back at home finally in another couple days.

For the last few days I've been back in Kankossa. During my brief
sabbatical in Kiffa I learned that if I waited a couple of days I could
catch a ride back on the shuttle that goes around delivering mail to
the volunteers once a month.

Before heading back I had the opportunity to be a guest author in
another volunteer's blog. I was more pleased with this essay than the
one I wrote for the school paper a while back. I like a little bit of
bite to my writing. Not quite jaded, but not all fuzzy and happy
either. This particular piece is a comparison of volunteers to
cockroaches in as flattering a way as possible.

Her entries are pretty entertaining in general. Her audience includes
family members and first graders she taught back home, so the tone is
a bit different. She has "respect" for her audience, whatever that
is. =) I've requested payment in kind and told her that we're all
adults here so she should spice it up a bit for you all.

On the subject of readings, I ran across this the other day:

This is a journal entry from someone in the first ever group to go to
Mauritania in 1966. Interesting to read the story of someone with such
a different experience of this country and the Peace Corps.

Love,
Will
