Something that I got to see while in Aioun that was pretty
entertaining was the Paris-Dakar rally passing through town. It is a
11,000km (7000mi) race going between (obviously) Paris, France and
Dakar, Senegal.

There are several classes of vehicles competing including motorcycles
and cars. The most interesting ones though are the camions
(semi-trucks). Parts of the race are closed to the support trucks, but
racers are allowed to help each other. So, teams enter the semi-trucks
into the race and there is a class to them all their own.

The race takes 18 days and at the time that we were talking to a rider
on the 14th they had gone from 200 motorcyclists to about 60.

It is mostly a European thing. Apparently there is an all motorsports
channel in the US now and it gets a little play there, but it is
really a big deal in Europe. The guy that we talked to was a driver
for an American motorcycle team that is new this year and is the
first.

They were all gathered out at the airport where a little city had
sprung up. Every team has lots of trucks and there is a whole big
exposition area set up where everyone eats. There were about a dozen
planes and as many helicopters helping to support the endeavor. It is
a goal of mine now to try and work tech support on the Paris-Dakar
now.

They've got an English website at:

Love,
