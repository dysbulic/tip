On the subject of buying stuff, I have learned that there is a
cookbook compiled by past volunteers of different things that can be
produced in country. Unfortunately it was stored on a disk which
died. That means there is one copy and it is paper. One thing I am
going to play with after stage is getting it back into the computer
and sharing it with everyone.

I'm all about the making of ice cream when I am in Nouakchott. I heard
from Andy it was possible and I've found something in the neighborhood
of evaporated milk. Ice creamy goodness, here I come. =)

*-*

Other interesting news, I was talking with someone yesterday who was
talking about people leaving. The ed volunteers get to leave three
months earlier than everyone else because school ends and if they want
they can ship out. Apparently though everyone here gets to leave a
month early if they want because Mauritania is one of four or five
"hardship countries" which the PC considers enough of a bitch to live
in that people get a bonus.

I talked to a girl who is here as a UN volunteer. She was here 4 years
ago as a PC volunteer and she said that at the end of her service she
went for 5 months down the coast to Kenya. There are some people who
will be COSing soon that are planning on through hiking the
Appalachian Trail after their service. Hell, after living here camping
for six months would be cake.

Right now my plans are along the lines of check out what I can get to
of Africa while I'm here. Go up to Paris next summer to see mom, dad,
Sharon and Steph. At the end wander my way up into Europe and do the
whole hosteling thing for a bit. Between English and French I figure
I'll be able to get around alot of it.

Love,
Will
