Well, I am back home again. New Years was fun, but largely uneventful... 
We crossed over yesterday afternoon and spent the evening in Rosso.

The crossing was entertaining. When you are crossing you can either wait 
for the ferry to fill up or you can get in a little fishing boat and 
they'll take you across for some extra money. We got about half way across 
and they decided to renegotiate the prices. The guy was saying "pay up or 
we'll turn this boat around." He actually cut the motor and let us float 
for a bit. We eventually made it over though.

Rosso was nice. I hung out with Natalie who lives in a village close by 
and she told me stories of life in the region. I really enjoy hearing 
about how different people live. The town seem pretty friendly and fairly 
clean.

I got some cool books from the library there. "Notes from the 
Underground," "The Ghandi Reader," "The Sound and the Fury," and "The 
Giver." I ought to be able to pass the two weeks before my next training 
in ease now.

We headed out this morning and rolled into Nouakchott after a pretty quick 
two hour ride. The only disturbing bit about it for me was we had four 
people in the middle seat and I was pressed pretty firmly against a door 
that wouldn't close well. It held though and I lived so all is well in the 
world.

We are getting ready for Early Term Reconnect (ETR) tomorrow so everyone 
from my stage group is in town. It is really cool to get to hang out with 
everyone. It is particularly cool for many of them; I get to see everyone 
semi-regularly living in the capitol, but the village people generally 
only see the people in their regions.

I'm pretty beat. It was a really good time, but not much sleeping. We are 
getting everything ready for throwing a party at Carl's. I've talked to a 
couple people who salsa and it is supposedly alot like swing (which I 
enjoy). I'm hunting now for some music...

Anyhow, going to go to a meeting.

Love,
Will
