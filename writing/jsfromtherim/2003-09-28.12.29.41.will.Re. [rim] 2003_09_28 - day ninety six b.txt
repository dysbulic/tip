Since some other people might not know this as well... The official
name of this country is "The Islamic Republic of Mauritania." (It is
the only Islamic republic where Peace Corps is serving currently.) The
name in French though (since they switch the position of adjectives)
is "RÃ©publique Islamique de Mauritanie" or "the RIM" as it is
affectionately called. =)
