Well, I took my final and I managed to squeeze by my required 80% for
the course with a 97.7%. =) I wasn't ever really worried about this
one though because it is all very basic information. Things should get
progressively harder from here. I ought to have time to get ready
though since it took us three months to get this one together. At this
rate I'll be able to begin teaching next year.

Merry Christmas Eve everyone. I am thinking I will go to mass tonight
at the Catholic Church. I have been in a church for the last 25
Christmases and I like the sense of continuity and community. Tomorrow
Obie is having us over and chocolate chip cookies and foie gras are on
my personal menu. Maybe some glazed chestnuts... I don't get to
experience any Mauritanian Christmas traditions for obvious reasons,
but I can at least sample some French ones.

Foie gras (which translates literally to "fat liver") is produced by
gradually increasing the amount of food a duck or goose is force fed.
Force feeding literally being a guy, a bunch of fatty food and a
funnel. This causes the liver to grow to as much as 10 times normal
size. The fatty liver then makes for a tasty dish apparently. The idea
is disturbing to me. Disturbing enough I'll only eat it once. =)

I'm off to find some supper. Hope everyone enjoys opening their
presents and spending time with family.

Love,
Will
