Today has been a good day. It was another meeting of a lovely care
package from Sharon with a free morning and a good book.

Last night Katerie had the volunteers in town over for a dinner. The
group before mine that will be leaving in a couple months is having
their close of service (COS) conference in a couple days and so there
are alot of people in town. Dinner was a pair of lovely sheep and I
gorged myself well.

On my way back home I picked up some sci-fi books from the bureau.
I woke up about ten this morning and spent the day eating skittles and
reading. Every so often I'd nap a bit. I had a couple of those moments
spent in drowsing comfort wrapped in my blanket where I wasn't
concerned about anything.

I really needed a day like this. I've been getting my schedule back on
track, but I've felt restless. Right now I started a book on
neurochemistry (_Descartes' Error_ by Damasio), a book on economics
(_Small is Beautiful_ by Schumacher) and a book on gender identity
(_Fire in the Belly_ by Keen). Good books all three, but I've been
doing too much thinking.

Schumacher divides the problems of the world into two classes. He uses
the terms "convergent" and "divergent" to describe problems that do
and don't have solutions respectively. (In math sums that "converge"
add up to some real number while sums that "diverge" add to infinity.)
He says that the only problems that really have solutions are human
devised ones. Reality is too complex to be managed completely by human
conception and so the issues surrounding human interaction (he is
dealing with economics) cannot be reduced to a science with definitive
answers.

He talks about a businessman who is riding home from the office and
who relaxes by doing a crossword or reading a detective novel. He
points out that though this is mentally active work it is considered
relaxing. He suggests that it is because it is calming to find
solutions and escape from the divergence that is reality.

I tend to agree. I think I've overexerted myself a bit trying to
tackle intractable problems. A little bit of a break is a good idea.

Love,
Will
