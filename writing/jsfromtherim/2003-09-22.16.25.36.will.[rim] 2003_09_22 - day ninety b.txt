So, I went to the University today and talked a little with Malik, the
UN volunteer who is heading up the Cisco Academy right now. I went
there with Matt a few days ago. Matt understood their situation to be
they have four professors, and one is in France taking some classes
and another is busy because he just got a new job.

Turns out that the situation is. They have two teachers. One is in
France for four months starting a week ago and the other has just
become the head of IT from the UNDP (UN Development Program) and so
isn't available to work. The math being fairly simple at this point
two minus two is no teachers. =)

He is wanting to find someone to get trained, but I'm not sure where
he can find someone. I'm willing, but I'm honestly not sure if I'm to
a point where I can take some intensive classes taught in French and
be at a point where I could productively teach.

One bit of reprieve is they have moved the start of school. It was
supposed to start on the first, but it has now moved to the twentieth.
I'd say if back home TTU had been jacking with the start date a week
before school was supposed to start you'd hear quite a bit of
bitching. =)

Actually the teachers at the secondary level play some part in
monitoring the elections, so the ed volunteers have been told not to
expect school to start until December at best and January at worst.
Those three months that you'll lose? Well, you couldn't have had
anything too important to teach. =)

I'm looking forward to being in the office where we will be working.
The internet seems quicker than here. Right now the air conditioning
is broken and any room with computers in it is not a pleasant place to
be without air conditioning. Actually the building has a tin roof, so
it is very much like the sweat boxes that they'd stick people in to
torture them in WWII. =)

Honestly, I was surprised when Matt told me that they were down 50% of
their staff. The theme here very much tends toward the dire. Learning
today that we are in fact fast approaching the start of school with
no one to teach is much more in line with how things go.

Love,
Will
