I think that my perspective is starting to change in some subtle way. I've
been very lax in writing over the last few days and I've not had much of a
drive to really be communicative at all. When I sit down to write the idea
of playing on the computer writing a program to make my pictures pretty on
the web has been much more entertaining than writing to everyone back
home.

I think a part of it is just a retreat to something that is known and
comfortable. It is really setting in that learning French is going to be a
daunting task that will take a very long time. I can certainly see
improvements in both my speaking ability and my comprehension, but at the
same time I have a much better understanding of just how far there is to
go. It is remotely possible that I will be conversational by the time
stage ends, but for me to be able to stand in front of a class and operate
comfortably is something that I probably won't see for a year at least.

Things were really booking at the beginning, but that was because I was
relearning French from high school and college and I was relying very
heavily on cognates. I've got the basics down now and I can generally
speak about very simple things in the present, recent past and future; but
nuance is entirely beyond me as well as pretty much all the vocabulary I
need.

I am going to visit a bookstore (called a librarie in French; bibliotech
is a library) when back in Nouakchott and see if I can hunt down an
interesting, but simple, book in French. I asked Steph that if she could
find the first Harry Potter to send it along. I wasn't too thrilled with
the story, but I figure the language ought to be simple. Also people have
been telling me to check out French comic books. Hopefully this stuff
won't be too expensive.

By the way, I am back in Kaédi. It is hot as ever. We left a very
comfortable 85 degrees to arrive down here at 98. I have been talking with
everyone who stayed down here and I've been seeing just how spoiled I've
gotten. =) (By the way I am writing this in emacs using a different input
method and if I don't watch the screen when I try to type I' I get Í (I
actually have to type I'' to get I'.)) Matt has switched his keyboard to
the French keyboard which has áéíóú keys. It is an azerty keyboard
rather than qwerty though (among other changes) and I don't type, so I
have to leave it like this so I can find the keys. =)

I'm still not feeling very talkative, so I will just leave you with a
couple quotes from a little handbook they gave us called "A Few Minor
Adjustments."

"Island life can be so slow that you'd swear you can feel your body's
 every internal function. And most of those functions don't work
 here."
                                                      -PCV, Micronesia

"Mali is a country which reaches out to touch you from the moment you
 arrive. It usually starts at your nose and works its way into your
 heart."
                                                      -PCV, Mali

Love,
Will
