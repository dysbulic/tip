I don't know if I have mentioned it, but I think I am actually
learning a new personality as I learn a new language. French is
starting to progress to the point where I'll get stuck saying
something and try and switch over to the English to figure out another
way to say it and the English isn't there.

The problem is that I still can't consciously think in French. So, I
when I switch modes and try and actively try to remember what I was
thinking it is in English and have a really hard time remembering the
French.

I am noticing though that when I have more forceful things to say,
certain things come out in French. Society is more confrontational
here in general and the way that I am learning to express myself in
French is more forceful than my English.

One of the things that I'm not really happy with in my personality is
how non-confrontational I can be. I think it is a holdover from
high school and I really admire people who speak up and speak their
mind. I think tact and interpersonal intelligence are important, but I
sometimes avoid my problems rather than tackling them and I think it
is something I need to work on.

Love,
Will
