Coming from Tennessee generally big storms run into the mountains and that
slows them down. I know that when I was living in Alabama really fierce
storms were more common because they had room to really work themselves
up. The same is true here except (as with everything else) magnified.

Last night a storm came tearing through at about 3:00am throwing garbage
all over the and threatening to remove the roof from our house. This
morning our front yard (well, the sand lot in the middle of the compound)  
is nothing but a bunch of gullies. Honestly I don't understand how since
gullies suggest water flowing and the ground is too flat for the water to
have gone much of anywhere.

I talked before about the logging truck hurtling down the mountain as a
metaphor for some of the diarrhea here as an unstoppable force. The storm
could easily be another. I had some bassi (the sand couscous) last night
prepared with untreated water. As I lay in my room listening to the storm
rage outside I said a little prayer that I not learn first hand the answer
to the question "what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable
object."

Having a bathroom inside the house... Well, having something other than a
hole in the ground, is a luxury I am going to try and find. I still feel a 
little guilty about having luxuries, but I really have no idea what I 
would have done last night if a load had come trundling down the mountain 
(so to speak.) =)

Love,
Will
