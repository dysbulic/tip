This morning we were supposed to have a meeting at 10, but it didn't 
happen, so I took a nap. After lunch we lay around outside and I took 
another nap. Then our afternoon classes were off schedule so I snoozed a 
bit more. I've been considering getting a hobby appropriate for the 
Mauritanian culture and currently narcolepsy is in the top spot.

*-*

Something that I am happy that I did was bring craploads (figuratively 
only) of underwear. I had about a months worth wearing each pair two days. 
The problem, unfortunately, as you might note from the subject, is that 
this is the 28th day and I am fast running short. My host mother in Khaedi 
washed alot of my shirts and pants, but someone said it is inappropriate 
to give them underwear and so I want to do that stuff on my own. Looks 
like I have a weekend project.

*-*

Something interesting I don't remember if I mentioned or not is that our 
language books are specifically African French. One of our lessons had a 
family tree in it and I noticed that one of the fellows had two wives 
which I thought was interesting.

Supposedly though Mauritania is much more a serially polygamous culture
like the U.S. I have no confirmation, but someone reported the average
number of divorces being near 5.

*-*

We went out tonight to a nice restaurant. I ordered a croque monsieur 
since I recognized the name from French class and as it turns out my first 
meal out in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania was a ham and cheese 
sandwich. Go cultural sensitivity. =)

Most people though had pizzas. Matt's in particular was cool; the fruits of 
the sea it was called and it was a seafood pizza. We went out with a 
Russian woman and her Mauritanian husband whom she met in Kiev. I mainly 
sat around and listened to people speak French I didn't understand.

The meal was really expensive. Most stuff was around 1000-1200um which 
combined with the 300um drink and 500um cab fair would be very taxing on 
our 500um per diems. I will go back at least once though because they have 
ice cream sundaes and I've been wanting one of those like you would not 
believe.

Anyhow, we theoretically have more meetings in the morning and I am 
considering sneaking my laptop into the bureau and trying to get it on the 
network there to get this mail out. I tried a cyber cafe today, but the 
fellow told Jay "no" and I don't know the French to try and bargain.

Love,
Will
