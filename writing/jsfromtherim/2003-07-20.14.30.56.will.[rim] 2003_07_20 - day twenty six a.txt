I have now moved and am living in the lap of luxury here in Nouakchott.

I was thinking about the movie "The Razor's Edge" today. Bill Murray's
character is a happy carefree sort slated to get married until he heads
off to WWII and sees the horrors of war. The rest of the movie surrounds
his search to restabalize his understanding of the world. At one point his
fiance's uncle puts him in a dump in Paris working in a fish market
hoping to shock him back into respect for wealth. I just remember the 
scenes with the dirty bathroom and the roaches everywhere and I figure by 
the end of two years I ought to be able to take damn near anything. =)

I'm almost to the point that I'd like to ask my friends who want to come 
visit to hold off until I am done and then come and bum around Europe with 
me for a bit. I'll definitely be speaking muey bueno francais in two 
years.

It is interesting that when Habib irritates me I speak pretty good French 
when arguing with him. Today he told my new family not to speak Pular with 
me because I was using the Pular for please and thank you. I spouted off 
that I had asked them to tell me that Pular and that I liked knowing a 
little and that I had to use French to as about Pular; all in French and 
all before I thought about the fact I was speaking French. =)

At my new house my toilet and my "shower" are separated by a wall. The 
actual amount of area alloted for both is actually less, but the separate 
drains is a nice luxury.

I thought that for all you who would like to experience the Mauritanian
shower experience I would help you to capture it. First go find a hole and
crap in it for a week or two. Your shower will need to be taken in an area
well used as a bathroom. Next find a medium sized bucket and fill it with
room temperature water. (First raise the room temperature to 92 degrees to
simulate the night in Khaedi. This should greatly increase the
odiferousness of aforementioned crap.) If you want the experience of a
real volunteer draw said bucket from a pond to simulate the algae you get
when you draw from a well. Now wet yourself from the bucket and then 
later yourself using a bar of soap. Do your best to lather completely 
since you have been sweating profusely since the last shower. Finally 
rinse yourself from the bucket and if water permits wash your hair. The 
particularly entertaining part of this process is washing armpits when the 
water is coming from below rather than above. =)

Really thought it is not very bad. I've not felt spectacularly clean, but 
you get used to it. The only hard part is trying to get he soap out of my 
armpits because they are hard to wash and any soap left there will cause 
irritation and a rash.

Expect a new diarrhea entry tomorrow. Tonight around 10 an interesting
dish was served. It was lettuce with french fries all over it and a couple
pieces of boiled chicken buried in the middle. Specifically, it was
lettuce freshly washed with lots of untreated water, so I've taken a good
dose.

When I started using the pepto bismol tablets regularly the last time it 
at least slowed me to once an hour, so I am hoping that if I get sick this 
time I can use the same.

My host mother bought some ice and had a nice big pitcher of water. She
kept offering and I didn't want to refuse, so I poured some in a glass and
carried it around for a while. =) I eventually hope to be drinking the
water, maybe, but in particular the thought of giraldial is not a pleasant
one.

Something interesting I saw today was a woman holding her purse with her 
head. It is natural when I think about it. People around here carry lots 
of different things on their head and it is a useful body part, so when 
you are stopped talking and want your hands free just hang your purse off 
your head. If it works, I say go for it.

Anyhow, it is late and I need a nap. I'll write more about my new home 
soon.

Love,
Will
