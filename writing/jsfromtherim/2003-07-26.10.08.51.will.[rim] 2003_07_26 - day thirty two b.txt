Just a couple lines since it is 0:30 (12:30am) and I am developing a 
habitual lateness. We did reviews this morning and I got good marks 
overall except I am usually late and I am not as careless as Habib would 
like with my French. He keeps trying to get me to just talk without 
thinking and that isn't even how I speak English. They've gone over 
learning styles sorts of things with us for when we develop our classes 
and it sort of surprises me that Habib doesn't pay more attention to it.

I like him though and if this is the greatest of my problems then I'll 
consider myself very fortunate.

After the morning meeting I went to the cyber and got mplayer for linux to
play my mp3's and movies. It took two hours to download (I did 46mb (30
up/16 down) of traffic in two and a half hours,) but I am very happy with
it and if any desktop linux users are not using it you should be. =)

*-*

After the cyber I got home and I had missed lunch. The practice here is to 
put the food in a little bowl and serve it to the person when they get 
back. People generally seem to eat alot and there was literally three 
pounds of food waiting for me. Eating old food put Carl out for the count 
a while ago, but this was pretty fresh, so I ate it.

The most dangerous thing I did was drink some of the ice water with lunch. 
It tasted alright and hopefully I'll be alright. The besap didn't do me 
wrong and I've stopped chlorinating, so perhaps all is well.

Something I've noticed though on the hands and don't know if I have 
mentioned is that the left hand thing seems to be mostly conventional. In 
particular I've seen people handling food items that will be consumed with 
their left hands. I was reminded today when one of the kids (1.5yr) was 
playing with the ice with his left hand. I didn't have any more after he 
put it back.

*-*

After I ate lunch I went outside because we were having Khaedi like 95
degree weather. The breeze was blowing outside though and it felt alright.  
Someone brought over a checkerboard (literally a board) and I watched them
play checkers for a while (called ladame or dame vinght (twenty) in both
Pular and French apparently.) It was pretty much the same except the king
can skip over multiple squares to make a jump. (More like a queen in chess
than a king.)

Wusaliman introduced me to a game called dame douze (twelve) in French and
chouki in Pular which is sort of like a cross between checkers and one of
those peg jumping games you find in the cracker barrel. I took a picture
of the board and I'll just let you see it rather than try to describe it.

The thing that was the hardest for me to master was leveraging the fact 
that a person has to capture a piece if they can, so you can use pieces to 
control your opponent.

*-*

Matt and Carl came by later and through their discussion with Wusaliman I 
learned that the name his friends call him in Gille (his French name.) I 
had been calling him by his given name because that is what people close 
to me use, but he uses the other because there are lots of Wusalimans 
around.

I met half of the Nouakchott fire department tonight. He was a nice fellow. 
Even though the buildings are almost all stone it still seems like a bit 
of underkill having him watch over 1.2 million people.

*-*

The mosquitoes are out now and I have been sleeping under a net. It is the
one that the PC issued and it is impregnated with DEET. I am guessing that
DEET is what killed the big ass roach that I found lying in my bed. I took
a picture of it with a 20um coin which is the size of a quarter for
reference. It's a little over twice a large I'd say. I have subsequently
tucked my net under the edge of the mattress.

Anyhow, bed time. French is progressing, some of my prepositions I started 
to write in French as I was tying. =)

Love,
Will
