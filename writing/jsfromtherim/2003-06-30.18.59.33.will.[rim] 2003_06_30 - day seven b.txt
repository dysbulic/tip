Today we did more general introduction stuff. The rain has made it really 
humid, so with the temp at around 90 I am really sweating. I managed to 
find an outlet, but I am typing in the dark, so hopefully this thing is 
charging...

We learned a little more about our language classes. This is something 
that can keep someone from becoming a volunteer. Right now we are just 
trainees, and we have to get recommendations from different coordinators 
to actually become volunteers. Apparently though, people who are having 
alot of language trouble often see themselves that they aren't making it 
and ET (early termination.)

We have bunches of acronyms. I am an ICT (Information and Communications 
Technology) trainee. We are a subset of the SED (Small Enterprise 
Development) group. There were 3 of us in the last group and all of them 
ET'd. One did not make it through stage (pronounced stahje, like in 
French) which is this training period. There are 5 of us now and all in 
all we seem to be a solid group.

We will be doing our language on a fairly personal level. There is a 
facilitator who knows a local language and French and we go to their 
house based on competence level. My group is so small that I am the only 
novice, so I may be studying alone. My French has been improving slightly. 
I have found some French speaking volunteers and keep harassing them 
"comment dit-on..." ("how do you say...") Once I get to intermediate 
French I will start in with Hassineya.

My hamstrings will be nice and loose by the time I come in. There is 
nothing like squatting for 15 minutes trying to get you ass as far out 
over your feet as possible so as to not shit in your shoe. I managed it 
though. How women around here manage to not live without constantly 
carrying bottles of monostat speaks of coordination beyond mine. =)

Also, pulling up sweaty khakis with one hand and getting them buttoned is 
damn near impossible. I have a ring that Steph gave me before I left and I 
have been wearing it on my left hand. I was wearing it on my left hand so 
that I would not have to eat off of it, but I've decided to move it over. 

On the subject of cleanliness we took showers this morning and the general 
consensus was it was asking to being pissed on. Well, I have no real point 
of reference, but someone said so and judging from the volume I am inclined 
to agree. The people out in the countryside though will be taking bucket 
bathes where you scoop and wet yourself then lather up and scoop some more 
to rinse. So, I'm not going to complain about being pissed on.

We went into town and there is lots of garbage. It literally smells like a 
dump. It is very hard to keep the place clean with so many animals 
wandering around and so little money to pay for garbage pickup. We walked 
down to the Senegal River and looked over at Senegal. Looks quite a bit 
like Mauritania. There are supposedly monkeys in some places and some of 
the trainees are hoping for pet monkeys.

Oh yeah, eating rice has its benefits stoolwise. I talked to a RPCV 
(Returned Peace Corps Volunteer) from Nepal before I came and he told me 
he used to spend hours discussing his poop with his friends. I am 
understanding how it becomes such an important part of your life. A couple 
of the guys have already gotten sick.

Anyhow, I'm going to go read a bit and sleep under my mosquito net. In the
morning if it isn't raining I'll try and take some pictures of the school
that we are staying at. It feels like such a different world. Just after
being here for two days I am starting to see how living in this different
world changes you.

Anyhow, dormir beckons.
Will
