I want to start drinking insecticide so that when the little sons of
bitches come to snack on me during the night it'll be their last
supper. Well, it generally is anyhow. Once the little vampires have
gorged themselves on my blood they are significantly less maneuverable
in the air and I have an easier time of adorning my walls with their
splattered corpses.

It takes some of the fun out of it though knowing that the smear of
blood came from me though. It is less graphic but more of a treat when
I do one in and there's no red to show that it got to me first.

According to the internet, here are some fun mosquito facts...

* The female mosquito needs the blood meal to develop her eggs. Male
   mosquitoes do not bite - they feed solely on plant nectar.

* Female mosquitoes can develop several hundred eggs at each blood
   meal and lay them in or around water. The eggs are attached to one
   another to form a raft or the individual eggs float on the water.

* These eggs hatch within 24-48 hours releasing larvae that are
   commonly called "wrigglers" because you can usually see them
   wriggling up and down from the surface of the water.

* In about 7-10 days after the eggs hatch, larvae change to pupa
   before becoming adult mosquitoes. The newly emerging mosquito has
   to stand on still water for a few minutes to dry its wings before
   it can fly away. That is one reason that mosquitoes don't breed in
   rapidly moving water.

* The female mosquito begins to seek out an animal to feed on several
   days after emerging from the water. Adult mosquitoes can live for a
   period of four to eight weeks.

I've been working at keeping my door closed and all my windows are
screened, but there are tons of the little critters in my house. I
played a combination of Mr. Miagi and Hiawatha for about an hour today
wandering around waving a towel and trying to see/kill any mosquitoes
that arose. Mighty hunter I managed to do in about fifteen of them. It
felt pretty good, but it would have felt better if I thought I'd
actually done something to stem the tide.

I think I am going to try hermetically sealing my door next. =) I'll
come back out after the hot season.

Love,
Will
