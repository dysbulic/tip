Since it is a Friday and we do nothing all day I've got some time to 
write. This is a little tech geeky note for anyone who might be traveling 
in the future and might find it interesting.

This is a PII 233mhz laptop. Pretty old and pretty slow. To say start Word 
in Windows XP takes about 8 minutes. I really only had one priority 
though: communication. I wanted to get and send email and I wanted to send 
pictures and web stuff. It doesn't need to be pretty, it just needs to 
work.

So, it is running redhat 9 and booting into runlevel 3. Pretty much 
everything is turned off except for sendmail which is listening on the 
loopback. I just send my mail as normal and when I visit the cybercafe I 
just take the patch cable from the machine I am on and plug in. They just 
have static ips and so I set the adapter to use the one for the machine I 
am on and bring it up. Sendmail then sends everything out.

Really I didn't have to change anything other than telling the ethernet 
adapter not to come on during boot and I changed the duration on the 
sendmail retry and fail queues to 5 days and 30 days respectively (from 4 
hours and 5 days.)

I also did a sudo on the mailq command so I can check it from my user 
account. And, I set up fetchmail to pull my mail down and set procmail on 
the box where it arrives originally to save copies in case this machine 
ever dies.

No problems so far. It definitely maximizes the bandwidth utilization alot 
better than reading mail via a browser.

Anyhow, I was pretty happy with it, so I thought I would mention the setup 
in case anyone else was ever in a similar situation.

Love,
Will
