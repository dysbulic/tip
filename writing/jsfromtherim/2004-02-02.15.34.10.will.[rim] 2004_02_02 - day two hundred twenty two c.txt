I took Matt by today to visit with my landlord for Tabaski. By rights 
the actual holiday was yesterday, but the visiting goes on for a little bit.

I want to get to the point I just drop in on him on my own, but right 
now it is so much easier with Matt. They sit and talk and I listen and 
interject an occasional question.

The day before yesterday he came knocking on my door and gave me a bowl 
of apples and oranges and bananas as well as a pretty nice cake. I 
really didn't want to take all of it since I had nothing to give to him, 
but much like back home not accepting a gift is pretty rude here. The 
best you can do is proclaim that the other person is far too generous 
and take it under protest.

In my gross foresight I managed to not think at all about the upcoming 
holiday and that I would be unable to visit the bank for a few days. 
This has left me with about two hundred ouguias in my pocket, a diet of 
bread for a couple days and completely unable to purchase a present for 
my landlord. Hopefully everything will open back up tomorrow and I am 
going to buy him some cheese. I fancied the swiss that I got for our 
Mexican night quite a bit.

On the subject of Tabaski. The day is apparently also the end of the 
hajj and there is a ceremony in the Valley of Mina (close to Mecca) 
where Muslims come and cast seven pebbles each at three pillars called 
Jamrah. The pebbles represent Satan being driven off by Abraham when he 
was tempted not to sacrifice Ismael. For the individual it also 
represents a rejection of their temptations. Apparently some people get 
really worked up in the process and will throw their shoes as well as 
their pebbles. There were some two million people who came to take part 
and unfortunately in the crush about 250 were killed.

There is a pretty good summary of the hajj at:

On the deaths themselves there is an article on the English Al Jazeera site:
http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/189AFE2D-0CCB-4860-A4AE-A0AC6F807DD4.htm

One interesting thing for the US mentioned in a couple articles was 
someone wrote "USA" on one of the pillars because "the United States is 
the greatest Satan." If you look at the tolls of who died though most of 
them were Asians. Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Turkey have 
the five biggest Muslim populations in the world. Most of these 
countries are not traditional havens for terrorist activities.

Anyhow, just thought it was some interesting stuff...

Love,
Will
