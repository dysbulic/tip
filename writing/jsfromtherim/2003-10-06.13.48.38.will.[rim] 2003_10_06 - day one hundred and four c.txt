Oh yeah, I wanted to mention that if anyone is interested in seeing
some Africa you are free to visit. The Peace Corps said they'd help
with letters of invitation which will help in getting a visa. Once you
make it here living is pretty cheap. My apartment would usually be
used for a family of about six, so there's plenty of room. =)

I was talking to some current volunteers about their trip to Mali and
hiking in Dogon Country. It sounds like it would be really cool. If
you want to come down and try some of that I'm up for it.

Anyhow, just wanted to let everyone know they're welcome to drop by.
=) My one disclaimer is you need to walk off the plane speaking French
or Arabic, or your experience won't be 1/10 what it could be.

Love,
Will
