It is fine. I am doing pretty well today. It is still hot as hell, but 
likely no hotter than your old home in Texas. I'm sitting in the shade and 
my thermometer reads 99. It isn't bothering me that much though.

On the packages though, you might just wait a little. I will be moving 
soon to the capitol and after that moving again back to Kaedi for a bit 
and then again back to the capitol. Letters and pictures are the easiest 
things to get right now. They connect me back to all of you not living on 
the face of the sun. =)

You can say whatever you like via e-mail. I get my e-mail on my laptop and 
no one reads it but me. Sending me really big stuff like lots of pictures 
isn't good though because my connection to the internet is so slow and 
really big stuff won't come through.

Mayhap. Something that I would like to look into from a health perspective 
at some point is protein supplements maybe. There is meat in he diet here, 
but a fish or two will be split among five or six people, so getting very 
much is difficult. I am wondering how hard it will be to keep on muscle 
mass in these conditions.

I will be living in Nouakchott though and supposedly I can walk over to 
the ocean (about 5km) and buy a fish the length of my arm off one of the 
boats for a few bucks.

Right now though I am waiting for things to stabilize so I can sort of 
develop a routine and start with some exercise. There's alot going on to 
worry about and I want to wait and see how things develop to decide what 
the real problems are.

Hillbillies, ha. One of us has eaten a goat with his hands in the last two 
days. Who's the hillbilly? =)

Love,

P.S. Messages sent to jsfromtherim@himinbi.org go to a bunch of people 
(and I think your message did.) This one is as well because your questions 
were general ones I wanted everyone to have the answers for.
