Today has been fun. I picked up Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut. I read 
quite a bit last night and then lay around until I finished it this 
morning. A cool book and definitely worht a read. I like the personal 
philosopies of Vonnegut's characters. They're always interesting.

Today is still a part of the post-Ramadan holiday, so nobody's working yet.

I went over to Marc's to discover that they had eaten all but five of 
the sixteen bags of yogurt I made yesterday. So, after we went out for 
mafe (a peanut sauce and rice dish) I got the stuff and made a extra big 
batch. I think I ended up with about six liters which is about two 
gallons. That's a bunch of yogurt, but it is looking like we may well 
have thirty people at Thanksgiving.

The stores were all closed, so I am still sugarless. I still have hope 
though and think I will eventually triumph and bear some chocolate chip 
cookies.

I felt guilty today which doesn't happen often. I was walking out of my 
house and my landlord met me outside. He asked me about the fete and why 
I didn't come visit him. The holiday is generally spent wandering around 
visiting with various people. He took me over to his side of the house 
and I saw the food he had set out for guests. He gave me some cookies 
and some fruit and dates. I was going out to the salon and he stoppped 
at the door. I wasn't quite sure if he expected me to go or not, so I 
went over to my side of the house.

Once I got there I ate the cookies which were really good and felt bad. 
I am really intimidated by the old guy. I don't know what to talk with 
him about. The fact that he is sixty years older than me puts up enough 
of a barrier and him speaking French and I not isn't helpful either.

I'm going to get Matt and take him by with me. I'm also getting on the 
French thing. It is easy to stay and play with computers which I am good 
and which is easy. I've got to get off my butt though and suck for a 
while at French.

The only times I feel guilty are when I feel like I didn't do my best. 
The French is hard and I've been avoiding it. As a result I've been 
neglecting pretty much all of my Mauritanian relationships. It is 
immature and I'm gonna change. I'm planning on taking him some cookies 
tomorrow provided I can find the stuff to make them.

*-*

Our evening was passed playing pool with various wagers. Marc will be 
saying a very patriotic prayer tomorrow at Thanksgiving in his 
Christopher Walken voice, Erin will be speaking in brogue and Marc now 
has a picture of me in my underwear holding a pool cue. An interesting 
evening all around.

Anyhow, it is 3a.m. here and I have much cooking to do tomorrow. Hope 
everyone has a happy Thanksgiving.

Love,
Will
