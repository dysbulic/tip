I think I burned out a circuit or something. I went home this weekend
with a short list of things to do and instead spent pretty much all of
it asleep or reading.

I did discover that _The Eight_ by Katherine Neville, _The Man-Kinz
Wars_ by Larry Niven, _Neverwhere_ by Neil Gaiman and _City of
Illusions_ by Ursula LeGuin are pretty entertaining all. None of them
are more than brain candy, but if you've got a bit of time _The Eight_
is worth a read.

I don't feel exactly rested now, but not quite fried.

I think Lent is a big part of it. I thought the whole bit with Molly
didn't especially bother me. Night before last I was at a dinner with
a cute French girl who usually I feel pretty comfortable talking
around. I had been speaking some English with a volunteer from en
brusse who can only speak Pulaar. By rights I knew I should switch to
French to talk to the French girl, but I let it slide.

By far the easiest way to break a discipline is to just try and not
think about it. Just put it out of your mind until it is too late. I
heard it said the other day, "it is better to ask forgiveness than to
ask permission."

I did recommit and managed to talk French with a French speaker. After
dinner I went to a April Fools party with a friend of mine who is a
really good cook. She had mashed potatoes with cheese. They don't do
cheddar here (because the French don't do cheddar), but she had
mimolette which was good enough. The next day she had me over for
leftovers and even though her English is as good as mine I spoke my
broken French.

For some reason writing makes me sleepy. =)

Love,
Will
