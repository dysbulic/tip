Disturbing image for the day... A common drink here is a combination
of milk and sugar (and some people report "soda"). My mother was
making a batch and I noticed that the container she was using to mix
the powdered milk was an old motor oil can.

I really wasn't sure what to do. I don't know:
 a. how hard it is to clean a motor oil can
 b. what had been done to this motor oil can
 c. what the long term health effects of drinking motor oil are

Or for that matter:
 d. if the milk I regularly have in my baussi is prepared in this can

I decided to let it slide since I wasn't quite sure if they'd feel
offended if I thought how they were eating was gross. Particularly if
they've been doing it for a while. I did politely decline a drink when
it came around though. =)

Love,
Will
