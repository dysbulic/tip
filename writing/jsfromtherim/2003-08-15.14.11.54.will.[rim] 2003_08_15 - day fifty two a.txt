As I was writing the subject I realized that we are exactly a month from 
swearing. Or at least we were. =) There has been something of a 
controversy because they changed the time and location of our swearing. 
Initially we were going to come up to Nouakchott for four days and then 
swear in on the 15th of September. Either for security or financial 
reasons things changed and we are now swearing in Kaédi on the 12th.

There were some unhappy stagiers over the whole thing. It doesn't bother 
me very much since I will be leaving for Nouakchott the next day, but I do 
understand the frustrations of the people who have been in Kaédi for the 
last month, will be there for the next month and then won't be able to 
leave for another three because we aren't supposed to leave site in the 
first three months.

There are certain things (like buy a cell-phone) that you can only do 
easily in the capitol. You can buy a crappy phone at a poor price in 
Kaédi, but apparently to get a good deal you need to come to Nouakchott. 
The other thing is that I see how much being in Nouakchott and having a 
change of pace changed my attitude. Kaédi really is a tough town (mainly 
because it is hot as hell) and getting out for a bit is nice.

I keep hearing it put in terms of the party that supposedly happens that 
night, and I don't think that is really what bothered most people. I think 
it was just never getting to leave Kaédi.

It just really drives home to me again how much suffering I am missing out 
on. I have not only gotten out of Kaédi, but I will get out soon after we 
swear. It makes me feel guilty for complaining at all about where I live.

Love,
Will
