As Steph was so kind to point out a sufferer of dysbulia is a dysbulic
(as in bulimia/bulimic) rather than a dysbuliac (as in
insomnia/insomniac). My Yahoo Messenger id has therefore changed. =)

I'm actually considering switching to AIM. I came from AOL in my youth
and eventually left, developing in the process the condescension often
a part of the distancing process. ("Only 'lusers' use AOL.") =) AOL
being a gigantic corporation and occasionally misbehaving didn't
help.

Now though they have bought Netscape, Nullsoft and sponsored the Peace
Packs. I reckon they're at least worth looking at. The protocol is
still closed, but I suppose switching from Yahoo it's six of one, half
a dozen of the other. Neither one is MSN so I suppose they'll do.

I suppose since the only person I talk to is Steph I could just get
her to use jabber. =)

Actually I have been reading and I can use gateways on other servers
than where my account is hosted. So, even though my account is
ivan_kara@jabber.org I can use the aim and yahoo gateways on a server
that has them. That's handy. It is like having a regularly updated
universal client except I don't have to update. =)

So, my new im's:
  Jabber: ivan_kara@jabber.org
  Yahoo!: dysbulic
     AIM: I Karamoz

Will
