On a lighter note I got a letter from my Aunt Sandy this morning.
Included was a clipping from the "News of the Weird" that included an
event I think sounds like an interesting trip for those who live in
Tennessee...

"In October, West Point, Ky., hosted 12,000 visitors for the weekend
 Knob Creek Gun Range Machine Gun Shoot, billed as the nation's
 largest, with a separate competition for flame-throwers. Especially
 coveted is "The Line," where 60 people (waiting list is 10 years long
 to be admitted) get to fire their machine guns into a field of cars
 and boats, and during which a shooter might run through $10,000 in
 ammunition."

That just seems like it would be quite a spectacle to see.

Love,
Will
