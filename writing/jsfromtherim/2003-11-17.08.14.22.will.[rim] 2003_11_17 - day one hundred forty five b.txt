Tech lessons for the day:

OpenSSH can operate as a SOCKS4 proxy.

Dante can be used under linux to forward traffic transparently across
a SOCKS4 proxy if the libraries are in the ld preload path.

Putting a library in the LD_PRELOAD environment variable will cause it
to be preloaded except for setuid/setgid programs.

Sendmail is setgid to be able to write to users mail spools.

Putting a file in /etc/ld.so.preload will cause it to always be
preloaded.

Mistyping the name of a file in /etc/ld.so.preload will render a
system completely useless because every process that tries to start
will die trying to find it.

You need to boot from a disk to repair a system that has a bad ld
preload setting. Even when booting to sash none of the tools will work
since they aren't statically linked.

The desert is a rotten place for disk drives. The sand eats disks and
drives alike. All the disk drives in our lounge are broken.

For the technically uninclined this means you will get my birthday
email once I go to the university and get my boot CD. My laptop is
dead. =)

I am off to see if I can find some brown sugar to make some cookies.
It is another of those surprising rarities.

Love,
Will
