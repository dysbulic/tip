Just a quick note before going off to the cyber to try and send these
off. (I've been in the computer room at the lyc√©e looking up names of
animals to try and put together a list for my host father. He's really
in to knowing what everything is in English.)

I was noticing today how they play with the kid and I was wondering if
the amount of touching that kids get around here affects their
emotional development. (In a positive way.) There's no TV and no crib,
so this kid is being handled almost all of the time by various people
saying his name and tossing him around and all sorts of things.

I've mentioned that touch here has alot fewer sexual connotations than
in general in the U.S. There's alot more same sex physical play in
public places and definitely alot more affection. I've had someone do
the French style kisses on the cheek as a close greeting and it made
me uncomfortable, but I thought it was cool. Literally the number of
men who I have been close enough to kiss on the cheek and have not
been in some form of combat with is almost certainly under five.

I like the physical closeness though and think it goes well with the
more evident emotional expressiveness. If I come back a little more
comfortable with both I'll be a happier camper. =)

Love,
Will
