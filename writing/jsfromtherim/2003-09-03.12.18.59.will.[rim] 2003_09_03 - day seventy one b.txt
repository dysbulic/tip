There are four levels of excited that the PC has here. It may be true
all over the world, I don't know. Seems like there would be something
like this everywhere...

There's the normal level of "try and not catch malaria, try and do
some good, blah, blah." This is what we normally do interspersed with
the occasional spectacle of nature for good measure.

There's a little worse of "that seems good enough, but don't you plan
on leaving town." This is called "standfast" and all that happens
pretty much is we stay at our site as much as possible and let the PC
know if we have to travel any.

From there we go to "hide!" Which is called "collect" I think.
Surprisingly it's not in my handbook. The gist is to get everyone
together. Sometimes it's everyone to their regional capitols,
sometimes everyone to Nouakchott. It really depends on the type of
emergency.

Finally there is "run!" Also known as "evacuate" and I suppose the
point is pretty clear. =) Security really is something that they think
about and there are several reasons Kaédi is good for training:
  a. It's on the river, so if the shit were to hit the proverbial fan
       we could be in another country in under an hour.
  b. There is also an airport with a 3km paved runway suitable for
       landing a jet.
  c. It's in the south and the Islamic tensions which are the most
       dangerous to a group of foreigners are less prevalent here.

So Habib woke me up a little bit ago and told me we're on standfast.
They told us a while ago that they be putting us through the paces and
I'm assuming that's what's going on now. I had to give Sidna (the
training director) a call and verify by voice that I knew that we were
on standfast.

I almost wish something would happen other than it would probably
screw up my getting to live in Nouakchott which I am looking forward
to. There's just not much to do in Kaédi. =)

Love,
Will
