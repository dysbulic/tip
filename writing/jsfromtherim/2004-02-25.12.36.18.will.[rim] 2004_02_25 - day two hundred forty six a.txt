In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real 
men, women were real women and Catholics didn't eat anything for forty 
days and nights except bread and water. They let off with the burning of 
people though and the whole system went to pot. Surely it seems as 
though it had gone as far as it could when they got Sundays off and only 
forwent meat, but no, the whippersnappers now-a-days pick their own food 
to give up. Bah.

Well, back wen Lent meant something there was a big party to kick it 
off. Not the Mardi Gras of today, but a pragmatic party to consume large 
quantities of food in the days before refrigeration. A traditional Mardi 
Gras food originating from this period was pancakes (food science wasn't 
especially advanced). In celebration we were to have pancakes last 
night, but Mauritania happened and so tonight we are to have delicious 
baked apple pancakes with honey syrup. Inshallah.

I'm off to do me some cooking.

Love,
Will

P.S. Discovery for the day. I am much better and comfortable with 
silence than French.
