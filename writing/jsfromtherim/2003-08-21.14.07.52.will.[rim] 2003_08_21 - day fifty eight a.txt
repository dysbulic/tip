I learned some interesting entomology last night that I wanted to share. 
The word toubab is the word used in pretty much all the languages to refer 
to white people. We have been told that it generally means foreigner and 
it was left at that. I had also heard that the word was originally Wolof, 
but it is widely enough used that while I was staying with my family in 
Nouakchott the only way I knew when my Pulaar speaking mother was talking 
about me is when she'd start saying "toubab."

Apparently though the word toubab is Wolof, but it isn't the word for 
foreigner. It is the verb "to convert." So, the term comes from the 
missionaries who were the first white people here. Whether it is a 
pejorative or it is just because they said it alot I don't know. I found 
the origin really interesting though.

Love,
Will
