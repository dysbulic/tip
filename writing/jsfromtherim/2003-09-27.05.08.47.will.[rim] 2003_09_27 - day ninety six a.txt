Interesting sight for the day:

In France, I have heard, that it is permissible for a guy to stop and pee 
on the side of the road if the spirit moves him. Well, the same is true 
here as well. The twist is that the guys crouch down like they are going 
to poo in order to do it. I have had the behavior described to me as both 
pragmatic (there are strong winds in the desert) and religious (something 
about wanting to keep everything close to the ground for some reason).

It is not something that there is any sense of uncouthness associated with 
so far as I have seen. If you walk by some playing fields all along the 
wall every three feet or so there is a little patch of wet sand.

The odd sight for the day was seeing some fellow crouched in a lot peeing. 
The odd part wasn't the peeing, it was that he was peeing in a bottle. 
After he was done he picked the bottle up and took it with him. What is 
going to happen with the contents of said bottle is something I would be 
curious to know.

Love,
Will
