Disturbing realization for the day: if you were in the desert and you
were going to be crawling around on your hands and knees the sand is
going to be hot. One thing you could do to deal with the heat would be
to wear flip flops on your hands.

It is an over here in the middle of the day. Yesterday I was walking
to the bureau in 105 degree heat and saw a fellow who looked like the
lower quarter of his legs had been sort of rolled sideways. It was
symmetrical so I assume it was a birth defect that had been like that
all his life.

I walked for a bit just trying to imagine living like that. Can you?
To be poor illiterate and have a birth defect that kept you from
walking. This guy was crawling down the side of the street in weather
I was lax to go walking in.

On the way that I walk to work there is a girl who is maybe 12. Her
mother who is sitting with her must carry her out there and lay her
out. Her legs are misshapen and the shape of her face suggests some
sort of mental retardation. She lies there as an incentive to give a
little money.

I haven't seen the same stigma with begging here. There's maybe five
minutes between when I can see the girl and when I pass her and I have
never seen less that four people give her money. I was walking the
other day and a taxi just sort of slowed down and the passenger tossed
out a little bag of rice. I don't know if it is the religion or
something else, but the people here are far more giving with the
little bit that they have than I saw back home.

I mentioned that one of the questions during my language exam was "the
U.S. has so much money why are there so many poor people there?" I
think that is a question that is going to stick with me for a while.

Nouakchott is not only my first time living in the third world, it is
also my first time living in a big city. There aren't really beggars
in Bristol or Cookeville. So this is just alot of new and disturbing
sights for me.

I had something cute to write about I think but it has slipped my
mind. Really I am starting to like this place there is just an edge to
it that I've not experienced before.

Love,
Will
