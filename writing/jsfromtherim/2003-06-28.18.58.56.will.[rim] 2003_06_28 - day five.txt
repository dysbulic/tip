We are really starting to get into the serious stuff. The big thing for 
the day was the butt pot. I asked a friend of mine who went to Ghana who 
Africans wipe their butt. He told me that they use toilet paper which 
surprised me since it seems like the shipping would be a real hastle.

Turns out that they don't. When you go to the latrine you take a little 
tea kettle full of water and when you are done you reach under and give 
yourself a washing. This was demonstated for us today. =) (Well, 
simulated.) I wasn't real clear on the left hand thing (you don't use the 
ass hand for any public exchange (no handing money, no shaking, etc...)) 
it makes alot more sense now. =)

Eating is really cool too. We get this big dish which today contained a
base of rice and a chunk of fish with vegetables on top. You scoop out
hadfulls of rice, ball them up, squeeze out the oil and them pop it in
your mouth. Something that is cute is that while you eat other family
members might flick little chunks of good things to eat in front of you. 
Women have a hell of a time because largeness is a sign of wealth in 
women, so they like women to eat alot. There were several volunteers that 
have been here a year and they didn't look especially chubby though.

All of it is eaten while sitting on the floor. I was thinking that the 
people will wonder why I have food stains all over the cuffs of my pants 
when I come home. =)

They also talked about the tea, which we haven't had yet. I'll write about 
it when we do...

It is a much more affectionate society intrasexually. Men and men (or 
women and women) can apparently be seen walking down the street holding 
hands. It is customary often to keep a hand on the other person while 
talking to them. Very different than the American bubble of personal 
space. Intersexually though things are very different. The Moors are very 
conservative and many won't shake the hand of a member of the opposite sex 
at all. In general a handshake might happen, but pda's simply don't happen 
at all.

I am running on a rapidly dying battery, so one last thing...

About the tea: between each cup a new pot is boiled, and that can take a 
while on a wood stove. So, sometimes people fall asleep and it is 
considered a compliment. You are trusting the people with your life and 
valuables essentially. Women however may not fall asleep flat on their 
backs because it is "an obvious invitation for some man to jump on you." 
Similarly, men are not supposed to lie on their front.

Well, gotta go. Some other trainees are playing cards downstairs. Tomorrow 
we journey to Kaedi.

Love,
Will
