Well, I had a nice boost today. There is a French fellow here who is in 
town searching for French Mauritanian literature for his thesis. He has 
a Linux based laptop that was not working well. I fixed it up for him 
and got him on the network here.

He was actually pretty lucky. The flag for journaling on his ext3 root 
filesystem was off and mandrake wouldn't mount it. The kernel couldn't 
find init (of course) and it was panicking. The number of people in this 
country who know enough about the linux boot process to fix it quickly 
you could probably count on one hand.

It just made me feel good because there is nothing like the exuberance 
you get from someone whose computer you have brought back from what they 
assumed was its death.

Also, at lunch I told my first joke in French. It wasn't much, but 
people chuckled and that was more than enough for me. Jay was saying 
that they don't like for us to live in Taverak-Zeina because it is too 
much like home, and I said that it was just San Francisco with goats.

Matt has been hanging out today as well and things are looking like they 
will be shaping up pretty well. Katerie is having a get together tonight 
and Matt and I are going to explain to his landlord that we want to 
trade. Hopefully all of that will go well.

Love,
Will
