Programming is no more about understanding a computer language than
being a novelist is about knowing how to write. It is a requisite to
be sure, but knowledge and skill follow each other no more naturally
than in any other creative practice.

When I was in Huntsville I went to the art museum and they had
paintings done by elephants. They'd set out five or six buckets of
nice bright primary colors out. The elephant would take a big fat
paintbrush and swipe at the canvas a few times. I think maybe gorillas
get an artistic itch sometimes as well.

Such is the level of a beginner programmer; broad and crude strokes.
They are often taxed enough learning the syntax of the language.
Grasping how one must think in order to properly use the language (and
different languages require different styles of thinking) isn't even
an issue yet.

That they manage to get anything on the canvas is a feat. The idea of
beauty is not even on the horizon.

I consider myself to be a fairly skilled programmer. Most of the work
goes into taking the problem and figuring out how to express it to the
computer. The actual writing it down afterward is mostly a logistical
formality. I have a real appreciation for seeing a problem well
dissected. There is a definite beauty in it as I have mentioned
before.

Seeing that butchered by beginners is troubling sometimes. Imagine
a place by a river where everyone grinds all their grain by hand. It
takes most all of their time since it is a slow process and the flour
that they produce is course and difficult to eat. Now imagine a
similar village which built a water mill. It took more time and
foresight, but now they have one man who makes lots of high quality
flour in less time than the one person in the other village.

Less efficient solutions that require more work to accomplish are
tiring for me because I would like to be able to teach them how to see
a water mill when they see a stream and a field of corn. It is a much
more direct path though to see, "grain... need it crushed... find
something to crush it with..." and look no further because they have a
solution that works.

I spent this afternoon helping a class with their work for a java
programming class. There was that usual sense of frustration at
needing to teach something more ineffable than simple syntax. It was
compounded a hundred times though by all communication being in
French.

I'd try and say, "using static sizing and positioning of the
components in your layout will likely cause your program to display
incorrectly in certain environments and will make future revisions
more difficult." I'd come out with, "that bad, see bad sometimes,
future more hard like that."

I'm pretty sure if I get sent to Hell for my heathen ways everyone
there will be speaking French.

These guys are screwed anyway. There are literally hundreds of pages of
documentation for the programming language that they are using. Even
the most skilled of programmers have to refer to this regularly
because there is simply too much information to remember it all. They
can't read a lick of it because it is all in English.

I'm sure they can finish their projects for class well enough, but as
for becoming real professionals? You've got to speak the language and
the language for 90% of computing's new developments is English. So
far as programming, I've not spoken to anyone doing programming work
locally. There's some work setting up networks and fixing computers
and a bit designing webpages, but no real programming work. I suppose
though that for many of them this class is just a stepping stone in
getting their degree. I feel sort of bad though because I know that
there have to be at least a couple who have the knack and would likely
both enjoy and succeed as programmers.

I still like the idea of teaching though. I especially like the idea
of having a class of my own where I could try and train them that the
syntax they are learning is the least of their worries. One day,
inshallah.

Love,
Will
