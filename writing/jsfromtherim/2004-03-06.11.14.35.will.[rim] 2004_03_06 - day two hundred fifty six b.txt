During my hunt for salmon last night I ran across something called
"halawa" in the grocery store. Whatever it was, it was mixed with
tahini and chocolate, so I figured I'd give it a go. I checked the
list of ingredients but all that they revealed was that it contained
"natural extra roots." Mmm, extra roots...

(It turns out that in French the word "extra" exists and it can be
used like "choice" in English. So I assume "natural extra roots" was
supposed to be "choice natural roots." The French version of the
ingredients includes "racines de halawa" or "halawa roots.")

It was odd. If you took play-doh and mixed it with a bunch of sugar
and crushed nuts you'd be in the neighborhood. Not bad really for a
non-discriminating eater such as myself. The chocolate in it goes a
long way with me.

It seemed though like it was meant as as ingredient rather than tout
seul. So I hunted on google this morning on "halawa recipe" and the
front page has two recipes for "hair removal wax" and one for henna.
I'm wondering what exactly I ate. =)

Love,
Will
