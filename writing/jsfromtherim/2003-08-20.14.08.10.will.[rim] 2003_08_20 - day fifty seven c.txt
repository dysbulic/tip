It wasn't really planned, but I think I am going to follow up the sex 
journal with a relationship one. I just got off the phone with Steph. I 
talked with her for about 30 seconds. Other than talking with my mom for a 
similar period earlier that's the sum total of my oral communications so 
far.

Really I've been cool with it. I generally like email better because I 
have time to think and they can be long or short depending on how much 
there is to say. It also lends itself to storytelling which is how I talk 
anyhow. =)

I don't really feel lonely right now. I just came from visiting with some 
trainees and volunteers. The talk was more gossip sorts of things though 
which I enjoy some, but I generally like to get in and try to understand 
people more than you get with gossip. I just felt sort of out of the 
conversation both interest wise and also just didn't feel very included in 
the group.

I wrote about the isolation stuff some before and it is something that is 
still with me. I just don't feel most of the time like I am clicking with 
the people around me. It's not bad and I'm not a social outcast or 
anything, but it just feels sort of flat and I'm not sure what to do about 
it.

It's not really a new thing though. I have it pretty much all over. It's 
even there sometimes with Steph and it's a problem in our relationship. 
Honestly I can't imagine that it could be anything other than something 
the matter with me. Generally when I can't seem to line up with the rest 
of the world it only seems reasonable to assume the problem lies with me.

I just wish I knew what to change. I try sometimes to "fake it til I make
it," and try to act like I think I would if I felt like I want to, but I
only seem to get farther away. The only time I remember feeling especially
connected to myself was for a bit in Huntsville after I adapted to being
alone and then I wasn't especially connected to anyone else.

And I don't want to make this sound polar and to say that all my 
relationships have been meaningless to date. Nothing could be farther from 
the truth. It is just like I've only been between 75-90% present and I 
want to go that last 10%.

So I was thinking about all this and just wanted to call some people and 
hear the voice of someone I knew cared about me. I didn't really think it 
at the time, but that was it. Unfortunately it is running about 500um per 
call and my per diem is 500um, so I just spent two days worth of money.

Love, (and mopey self-pity)
Will
