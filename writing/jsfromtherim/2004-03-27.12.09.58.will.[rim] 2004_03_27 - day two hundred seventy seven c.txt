While lying around Kiffa I was perusing an old copy of The Utne
Reader. There was an interesting article on water consumption.
According to the article the average household in the first world with
a dish washer, washing machine, sinks, showers, sprinklers and
what-not uses an average of 1000 liters of water a day. The average
household with a distant water source uses 5.

I think perhaps they were exaggerating a bit. The five liters is low I
know because in Kankossa I was pulling water from a well and I was
drinking probably four liters a day. (The hot season is once again
commencing.) Saying that the differences are along orders of magnitude
is probably true though. When you take a shower out of a bucket you
use maybe fifteen liters. Washing clothes in a bucket uses maybe
forty. The simple fact that you have to go get it and carry it to
where you want to use it makes a big difference.

Interestingly a report recently published by the UN says that it takes
1.8 tons of raw materials to produce one new home computer. About 1.7
of those tons are water.

I really don't know enough on the issue to know if the world really is
shaping up to start having water problems. I figure it's something to
keep in mind as you go about your life though.

Love,
Will
