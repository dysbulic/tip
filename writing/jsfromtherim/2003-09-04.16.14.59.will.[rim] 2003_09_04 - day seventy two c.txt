Sorry about all the duplicate messages earlier. Here is my lesson for
the day in mail in unix. I mentioned recently switching from pine to
mutt.

Well, pine sends its mail by connecting to a mail server and actually
sending the message. This means that pine can operate pretty much
anywhere since it handles all the particulars of sending the message
itself. The way that it worked on my laptop is I was actually running
sendmail which allowed relaying connections from localhost.

Relaying, for anyone who cares is simply when a computer accepts a
message that is not destined for it directly and passes it on. If you
have ever set up something like outlook and specified a smtp server,
you were specifying your smtp relay.

The way that mutt sends mail is to pipe the message to another program
which then delivers it. In general on a *nix machine this program will
be sendmail as well. This is how it works on my laptop. The advantage
to mutt is that I don't have to have access to a smtp server in order
to send mail. (I.E. I don't have to run sendmail all the time.)

Sendmail though, when it is run as a program that receives piped input
is not running as the root user. This means that it cannot store
messages in the usual queue location of /var/spool/mqueue (which is
only writable by root). Instead it uses /var/spool/clientmqueue which
is writable by the smmsp group (and the sendmail binary is sgid to
that group).

Ok, the thing is that when you run the mailq program it only checks
/var/spool/mqueue and so it always reports that there are no messages
waiting to go out. (Which is what I was talking about yesterday with
the disappearing queue.) Before with pine it was always in the mqueue
and so I could use mailq to see what I had waiting.

When I checked and saw an empty queue I was confused and didn't know
there was another place and so resent one journal to see if it would
appear. It didn't and so I waited until I went to the cybercaf√© to try
and see if running sendmail -q would make messages appear on the
receiving end. It didn't and I am guessing that is because it only
checked the mqueue.

So, I bounced the journals I sent before (and accidentally bounced the
one I resent). Bouncing something is like forwarding, but you don't
edit the messages and if they came from someone else, to the new
recipient it will look as though the message came from whoever sent it
to you.

When I bounced them though, I am guessing, the sendmail running as a
pipe checked the clientmqueue and send the first round I had sent
already. This meant that one journal went out 4 times (twice in each
batch). Sorry about that. =)

Now I am using mailq -O QueueDirectory=/var/spool/clientmqueue and all
is well in the world. =)

Love,
Will
