I finished Catch-22 a little while back. I enjoyed it as a piece of
artwork quite a bit. So far as inciting deep insights, not so much.

One thing that I did find a bit of resonance with in my own life is
the disconnect between the soldiers and the army. The relationship
between them is based almost completely on the receipt of a reward or
the avoidance of punishment. I think that in part it comes working with
any large bureaucracy.

My experiences with Peace Crops have been not quite as extreme, but I
do see certain correlations. The administration has to deal with about
75 people in this country and has to try and maintain a consistent set
of regulations for dealing with them. This means that oftentimes it is
impossible to deal with the nuances of the individuals needs.

This is true in the army and it is true to some extent in the Peace
Corps. It is not something I fault them on, but rather consider it to
be a systemic artifact. It just comes from having so many people and
dealing with them from a centralized bureaucracy requires a certain
degree of dehumanization.

One of the more unfortunate side effects of this phenomena is the
disconnect between the individuals and the administration. It is not
quite to the point of it being "us volunteers" against "the bureau,"
but there is a definite sense of identification of individuals with
one group or the other. It is largely without any detrimental effects
other than the occasional rule being bent (or occasionally broken).
Our particular group is mature enough that they don't simply disregard
all the rules which is the one thing that could be a real danger of
the division.

This ties in to the other book I just finished, The Gandhi Reader by
Homer Jack. Philosophically I really admire the satyagraha (passive
resistance) movement. His willingness to sacrifice himself for his
beliefs is something I am awed by. I can see and recognize it, but the
thought of patterning my life after it seems as foreign as the thought
of getting a full body tattoo (though more enviable). It is something
theoretically possible, but so outside of my everyday experience that
it feels like I would need to be a different person.

I think that the foreignness is not so much his philosophy as his
resolution. I agree with the basic premises pretty thoroughly, but
having the force of will to carry out my decisions no matter what...
That is just amazing. The writings in this book are biographical as
much as they are philosophical and I think you get a good sense of
just how deep his resolution runs reading it.

It seems to me to be based out of selflessness. I suppose that I can
say that my not holding to my commitments is usually selfish. I am
already feeling intimidated about my decision to not speak English
during Lent. I am coming up with situations where it isn't practical
and where I am going to need to mediate it. (Like at work sometimes.)
Marc and Matt both make fun of me sometimes both because of my accent
and my construction. The thought of dealing with them is about as
intimidating as anything. I suppose this is my opportunity to practice
being more like Gandhi. =)

Economically the jury is still out on the guy. As an unabashed
technologist his positions of the effects of technology and the
necessity of simplicity don't quite sit with me. Interestingly I found
a copy of E.F. Schumacher's Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People
Mattered in the bureau today. I'm going to read it and give it more
though.

Love,
Will
