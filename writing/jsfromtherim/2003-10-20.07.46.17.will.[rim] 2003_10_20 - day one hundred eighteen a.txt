Last night we had the most amazing meal I have had here and am ever
likely to have here. I have never been sitting at a table knowing that
I was eating better than all the rest of you, but last night I was.

There is a Lebanese restaurant near my new house. Jay has tried to get
us to go a few times, but it hasn't worked out. Last night I took a
group over there. What we discovered once we got there is it is pretty
pricey. Main dishes were running about 3000um and appetizers in the
800um range.

They had something though called an assortment. There were 6, 8, 10
and 12 assortments. The problem was that it was still really
expensive, starting at 2500um and going to 4000um per person. We tried
discussing exactly how it worked with the guy. Unfortunately everyone
was from the South and spoke Pulaar other than me. His accent was
really thick and I could only sorta understand him.

Eventually we gave up and he wandered off to give us a bit more time.
He came back a bit later and after a similar experience he said "don't
worry, I'll bring you something good."

He came back with tons of little bowls. There were literally in the
neighborhood of twenty little bowls. If it was Lebanese and it was
food it was in one of those bowls. Tabouli, hummus, falafel, eggplant,
and many other things whose names I don't know. It was by far the best
meal I have had or expect to have here. It was so much food that we
didn't even finish all of it.

In the end he charged us 15,000um for the seven of us which really
wasn't a bad price for the quality of food. Shelagh worked out a deal
with the Chinese place to give us half off and I'm thinking about
taking her by to try and work out a PC special there too.

Love,
Will
