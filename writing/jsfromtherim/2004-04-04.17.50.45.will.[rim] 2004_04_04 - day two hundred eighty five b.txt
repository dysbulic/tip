So, I've been here more than seven months now. In that time I have
only really managed to accomplish one thing: I am certified to teach
the first semester of the Cisco curriculum.

In principle we were going to head to Dakar and get all trained up
right after we finished Stage. Then I was to go down by my self. Then
someone was to come up from Dakar to train us. Then someone local was
going to come in and do the training. Finally we managed to get
through the first training. The second never happened as it was
supposed to, but I had the solace of at least having started since I'm
past a third of my Peace Corps service.

I talked to Cisco in California on the telephone the other day. I'm
not certified to teach the first semester. The class that they created
online was a student class rather than the instructor class we needed
to take. The information was the same, but the exams would have been
different. So, it turns out I've not actually done anything yet. I
think if I hang out here long enough accomplishments from earlier in
my life will begin to disappear. It's a good thing I spent such a long
time in college. Hopefully Mauritania won't manage to eat through
eight years before I get back and I'll still have my high school
diploma.

I'm not terribly troubled. It just worked to cure me of any lingering
attachment I had to being productive.

A friend of mine, Eric, sent me the following question:

"Something that echos through my head every time I read one of these
 things is, 'why?' From the tone of most of your journals it sounds
 like these people need food, water and clothing alot more than they
 need internet access via Cisco routers. With your knowledge and
 abilities wouldn't it help them more if you came back to the western
 world and donated 20% of your salary to do something like distribute
 information on how to rebuild their agricultural base?"

>From a the standpoint solely of the most good to the most people over
the most time, quite possibly. As I understand it there are more
people looking to get into Peace Corps than there are people looking
to give them significant amounts of money.

If I were replaced with a agroforestry volunteer who would work on
reforestation or nutrition or water conservation, would that likely
help the lives of those most in need? Again, it is possible. I'm going
to assume yes.

It is saddening. I disliked the feeling that would come over me every
so often sitting watching TV that because I was choosing to use that
time for myself somewhere a child starved to death. I thought maybe I
could lose it in coming here, but there's always something more that I
could be doing.

The main question for me was the extent to which I owned my life. Was
it mine to use as I pleased, or with privilege did there come some
responsibility. If there did, as I suspected, how much. Did I have a
right to any comfort at all so long as there were those with less who
I could help by giving some of what I had?

I eventually decided that more than likely if I were really
enlightened I'd think not, but as it was I was only sufficiently
enlightened to want to suffer a bit. I'm generally helpful and caring,
but not to the point that it is really uncomfortable.

It is not an especially pretty truth, but it is one I think most
everyone lives with. I don't know any saints. We all decide to stop
giving of ourselves at some point.

Being here is pretty much along those lines. I am here mostly because
I was scared of going out and getting a job or trying to get into a
grad school. I liked the idea of traveling and seeing some of the
world. I liked the idea of helping the world, but I was already a bit
disillusioned of the idea that the world, in general, likes to change.

It isn't that I don't want to help. I do, it just isn't the only
reason I'm here. As Wilde said, "the truth is rarely pure and never
simple."

Maybe I'll get enlightened and leave the Peace Corps and get a job
with a big corporation making oodles of money to give away. That'd be
an interesting twist. =)

Love,
Will
