Some interesting sights for the day...

Something that we don't get back in the States, not having law 
enforcement descended from the French military, is guys walking around 
with the look on their face, "my beret makes me look like such a 
bad-ass." Whereas here if you have a machine gun in your hands you 
likely have a beret on your head.

You ever seen the movie Homeward Bound? It has two talking dogs and a 
talking cat trying to find their way somewhere. I saw the Mauritanian 
version today as a goat wandered by with a cow and a dog following along 
behind. =)

The dean just stopped by again and supposedly the air conditioning guys 
will be by today. That'll be nice; I'm slowly melting here.

Love,
Will
