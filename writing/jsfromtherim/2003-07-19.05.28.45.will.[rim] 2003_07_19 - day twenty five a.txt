I'm hanging out in the cyber cafe trying to get my mail downloaded. Steph 
sent me some pictures, but they are in one big block and it keeps running 
for twenty minutes or so trying to download them and then dying. Alas.

Something that they have here that we don't see much in the US id 
unrepaired birth defects. There is one young girl who visits my house 
whose feet are turned such that the bottom is turned toward her back and 
she is literally walking on her ankles with her heels facing behind her.

Amazingly though she is one of the most spry people that I have seen. 
Yesterday we heard someone calling out and looked up and someone was 
peering over the edge of the roof. I was really surprised to see her come 
climbing down a little bit later.

I really don't know how those sorts of things stand in this society. 
People don't seem to notice, though I suppose in my society people would 
notice and act like they don't. I think though that people notice where I 
come from because it is so unusual. Here it is still unusual, but not as 
much so.

*-*

I got a few pictures up on the web. I am going to go through and generate
some indexes of thumbnails and comment them, so you could just wait. As I
collect stuff it will go up at: http://odin.himinbi.org/mauritanians/

There is also a bob directory under pictures and that is stuff from Robert 
Salita. The stuff other than the movies was an accident, but he has a 
digital movie camera and has gotten some really good shots. He has some 
interesting stuff at: http://wheresbob.smugmug.com/Other/1872 from 
staging.

The other IT people will almost certainly have stuff going up and as it 
happens I will post links.

Love,
Will
