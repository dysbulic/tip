Subject: [rim] Ants
Message-ID: <20040720195006.GA12880@honors.tntech.edu>

I have ants in my house. This is reasonable since one of the staples
of my diet are "camel biscuits," a local cross-breed of animal cookies
and oyster crackers. I'm actually sort of fond of them. Back in
college I had a family of ants slowly consuming the gummy bear army I
had guarding the window. During stage I had limited success training
an elite force of attack ants to help me in my constant battle against
the Ka?dian flies.

To date we've generally shared the space amicably. Every so often
they'd get a little ambitious or greedy and I'd sweep up a couple
hundred and drop them in the toilet just to show them who's the
boss. Then there was the debacle where a brash few of their lot were
eaten alive for underestimating my love of cornbread. All in all
though they wander about cleaning up crumbs and I am happy to leave
them to it.

This is changing though. I whacked my foot on a rock a bit ago leaving
some scrapes on my toes. For whatever reason the ants think that scabs
are food. So, I will now often wake up during the night to find my
feet covered with little ants doing their best to chew holes in my
toes. It is more disconcerting that painful, though it isn't exactly
soothing. I was hoping that it was some sort of anomaly and that maybe
I'd gotten something on my feet to cause it, but it's been a week now
of pretty much consistent toe munching.

I've stepped up my toilet drownings in an attempt to send a stern
message, but to little avail. Other than reduce their numbers I've
seen little change.

I think I'm going to have to start sleeping in socks.

Love,
Will
