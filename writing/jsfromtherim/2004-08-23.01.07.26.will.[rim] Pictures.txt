Apparently the Peace Corps has been holding a contest to expand their
repertoire of marketing images.

Of the 25 winners, we had two from Mauritania:

 PCV Jessica Dunsmore: Showing Off Our Henna Hands

 RPCV Kerry Zahn: Women at Well
  http://www.peacecorps.gov/learn/whatispc/Gallerypop_PhotoContest.cfm?Gallery=hcn&ImgNo=2&maximgs=6&catNo=5

There are some really pretty pictures there. You ought to check them
out. I'm thinking I'm going to try and crack my camera open and get to
the bottom of its mysterious death. It is a real shame not to get more
pictures while I am here...

Love,
Will
