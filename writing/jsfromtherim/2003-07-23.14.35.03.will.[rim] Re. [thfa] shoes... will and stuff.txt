That is an excellent question and one that I have no good answer for. 
There is actually a campaign back in the states called something like "we 
need water" which is against the introduction of information technology 
infrastructure when more fundamental needs are still pressing.

The main thing that I do know is that the country wants us here. I have 
about 30 pages of poorly translated French that I have been wading through 
that is the Mauritanian plan for using IT to boulster the economy, improve 
education, and facilitate health care.

The problem is that there is next to nothing right now. I don't think that
computers are a solution on a large scale to the problems of Mauritania,
but there are a few areas where they could be really helpful (like
ecnomics and some health care), but there is no skill base to support it.  
I really don't see myself as offering Mauritania a panacea, but I do hope
that what I do can be a part of helping to sustain the work of others.

This is a question that I would like to come back to when hopefully I 
learn a little more about exactly what I'll be doing.

Very cool. There was an address that I had in a journal a couple of days 
ago and that should be the one. My physical location is going to be 
sporadic for a bit, but hopefully whatever you send will arrive intact. =)

Pat, just before he left, recieved a box of cookies via FedEx that left 
about six days before he got them. No idea on the cost with that...

You'll have to get them to Brett and have him get them on the web. I'd 
love to see them, but getting large things via email is a problem right 
now.

Love,
Will
