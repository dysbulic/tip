Well, Christmas has come and gone. It was largely uneventful. Thanks
though to my psychotropic anti-malarials I at least got to be home
rather vividly in my dreams. =)

Christmas Eve after I finished writing in my journal I was touched
with a bit of homesickness. I wandered the streets of Nouakchott for a
bit singing Christmas carols to myself until eventually ending up at
the Catholic church.

The mass was interesting for a variety of reasons. We started out with
Silent Night doing each verse in a different language. I've been in a
service like that before, the thing about this one is that more than
likely each of the seven languages was likely a first language for
someone in the crowd.

The service itself was mostly in French with a smattering of Latin and
a few songs in African dialects. Most of the people there were African
and I am guessing a few French. The choir was entertaining because
they were singing what were obviously French church songs, but the
singers, particularly the guys, were singing African style which is
much more akin to chanting. They also had djembes (drums) and shekeres
(gourds covered in netting intertwined with cowrie shells, think
maracas) going in addition to the piano. All of these combined to make
a bizarrely pleasing musical concoction.

They had a Protestant guy come up and give a sermon before the homily
and that was interesting. I was actually able to understand the
majority of what he was saying. The priest then read something or
other. His voice was sufficiently soporific that I think I would have
missed most of it had it been in English.

After the mass (which lasted two hours) I got a call from Miranda
saying she had some food so I went to visit her house. I sat around
talking to a Mauritanian fellow for a while. He was trying to convince
me that learning Pulaar would be a useful endeavor. I told him that
I'd attend the French first.

(As a note I now use the English phrases "ameliorate" instead of
"improve" (am√©liorer is French for "to improve"), "demand of" rather
than "ask" (demander), and occasionally "attend" rather than "wait
for" (attendre). There really is only room in my head for one
language. The melange ("melanger" = "to mix") of the two though is
rendering my already obfuscated English nigh incomprehensible.)

*-*

I've been feeling a disconnect with many of my peers in the last
little bit. The going out to a bar and drinking is the thing to do for
alot of people. I like going and dancing, but night after night is
leaving me wanting interactions in environments where I can speak to
my companions.

Christmas at Obie's gave me a chance for a little of that. I had a
chance to try chocolate chip cookies again and they were really
popular. They were accompanied by yogurt that I successfully produced
the night before. It was definitely a good day culinarily.

Giftwise it was a little sparse. We did a "Yankee swap" where everyone
brings a gift and then we go around allowing people to steal. I ended
up with a quarter of a roll of duck tape. Certainly not a bad thing to
have, but not terribly satisfying to my materialist side. I have a
report that there is a box from my Cousin Ted probably somewhere over
the ocean now. It contains "consumables" so I await its arrival
expectantly. =)

I did get a call from Steph which was cool. I spent some time talking
to another volunteer about my parents (who seem to have lost both my
address and phone number; it's 222-675-9910.) She suggested that I
call them and I think I will once I get back from Senegal.

The day after Christmas was spent largely asleep. I got up to wash
some clothes and find supper. Other than that I had neither the
impetus nor good reason to get out of bed. Matt and Carl came by for
supper and we hung out shooting the breeze for a while.

Carl's landlord came to visit him and told him he likes his house
better than his own and wants to move his family in. Carl can either
continue to have a room of his own for free or move. It took him three
months to find this place and another two weeks (and 20,000um) to get
the water turned on. The guy has offered to pay his rent in a new
place, but finding a new place is likely going to be a pain.

I feel really lucky to have the place I have. It is small and simple,
but it suits me.

Well, I leave out for Saint Louis, Senegal tomorrow and I need to try
and get some CFA. Hopefully everyone has an enjoyable New Years. I
certainly hope to.

Love,
Will
