I've been back in town for a couple days.

I pulled an all-nighter working on the Aioun lab and then we left town
and drove 14 hours through the night to Nouakchott. The only sleeping
I did during a 36 hour period was sitting up in a car seat. I,
naturally, spent my first day back asleep. Yesterday the internet was
dead here, so I didn't get caught up on much.

Here I am though and with my handy list of interesting things to
mention.

The thing that has been foremost on my mind other than sleeping since
I got back has been Molly. I spent about a week in Aioun and the other
half in Kiffa and Kankossa with Molly. We spent some time together
right after WAIST as well.

I enjoy being around because she is bright and playful with a tinge of
angst which resonates with me. Unfortunate incompatibilities in what
we seek in a significant other precludes the possibility of romance,
but hanging out with her and talking is entertaining regardless.

Sadly this time it was less fun since Easter is two weeks out and I am
still practicing my rutabaga imitation. The word that comes to mind to
describe her attitude toward my language problem is the French verb
d√©ranger means "to bother." The reason it comes to mind though is its
more dramatic English cousin derange meaning "to make insane" or in
this case "to piss off severely."

I was staying at Molly's house and she accused me of violating the
sanctity of the English safe zone within its walls. She did have an
excellent point. Kankossa is a three hour drive across sand dunes from
the nearest paved road. There's only one other fluent English speaker
in town (the other volunteer) and they don't see each other all the
time. Whereas I, in the big city with many people around, have to work
at practicing my language she has no choice. The one place she gets
away from it is with her friends and in her home and I came and
despoiled both of those.

She also had some good points about "by what right" did I get to
choose to make the lives of those around me more difficult by
rendering myself unable to communicate all but the most basic
thoughts. I had discussed my desires to be less detached and more
connected to those around me and she said this seemed to fly in the
face of that.

My position was that a big part of the point with Lent is to choose
something and see it through. Jesus didn't go hang out in the desert
for a week, say "Damn I'm hungry, I could sure go for a hamburger,"
and leave. He was there for forty days even though, as I can vouch,
the desert is a rough place to hang out.

(There is also the counterpoint I'm not Christian by any traditional
definition, not that a Christian would likely give up English anyhow
for Lent.)

The French thing has been probably one of the harder things I have
done for Lent. Not talking at all was easier than this since it was
both for less time and in a place with more distractions. While it
forced me to seem a bit odd, it didn't force me to do something I am
actively bad at.

In the end with Molly I took a couple dispensations and started
reading and writing in English as well as recounting stories. With the
everyday talking I decided that even though was extremely tiring and
exasperating I was going to stick to it.

Molly, like others in my life before, got a taste of the fact that
there are a variety of things more easily accomplished than getting me
to change my mind once it is made up. These things include: going
faster than the speed of light, blotting out the sun, walking on
water, and teaching an old dog new tricks. In short, I wouldn't budge
on the issue and we subsequently passed the next two days largely in
silence broken by brief rehashes of our positions.

I wrote her a letter before I left apologizing for the whole violation
of sanctity thing and expressing a desire that we could be friends in
the future. I really do respect that she has a much harder time that I
do. I made the decision to go back out to Kankossa not knowing that it
would be a problem. Lent is important to me though and I felt like I
had adapted some and that she needed to work a little harder to adapt
to my desires.

Honestly, I've got hope. My sense is that our personalities are well
suited even if we do have a lamentable quantity of stubbornness in
common.

To briefly touch on another issue in the key of women put off by
Will's personality, Steph's journal today included this tidbit:

 "Justin is not Will and I need to stop my fear in its tracks that he
  will become him. When I compare, when I expect things to happen- I
  so shortchange Justin and how he makes me feel. And that is simply
  not fair and something he doesn't deserve.
 "I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop- but it hasn't.
 "I keep waiting for the moods to kick in- but they haven't.
 "I keep waiting to be ignored- but I'm not."

Again, I know that some of my beloved readers dislike what they
perceive to be an unhealthy habit of continued attention on Steph when
distance would likely give me time to recenter. I respect the
position, but as you've likely noticed from the increasingly
introspective (and depressive) tone of my journals, I'm working on some
identity stuff and she is someone who knows me better than nearly
anyone else. Even though all she sees is not clear, it is an important
way for me to be able to see myself.

I don't think I'm a good match for a whole lot of people. The things
I'm looking for in my life are a little bit different from alot of
people. I'm ok with not making everybody happy. The hope is still
alive though that I will find someone who is looking for the sorts of
things I am. At this point I'm more content to wait than to try and
become someone new.

Love,
Will
