So, what I am supposed to be doing right now (and for the last three
days) is getting my class ready. I will be giving a class tomorrow
afternoon all in French about the parts of a computer. I'm doing the
same class that I did before because it is something that alot of
people don't know, but that it can be useful information.

For example Sharon was talking about how computer being out of
memory. (Which hopefully Brett has dealt with.) =) She wasn't familiar
with the two kinds of memory that a computer has and so couldn't
really describe the problem to me. Knowing just the basics of what is
going on under the hood can be helpful at times.

So, I have written the whole thing out in English and now I am going
back through and translating it. Most of it I could probably fake if I
did it off the cuff, but to really know that I can say all of it takes
doing this.

Also writing is really good to make sure that I really know it. It is
easy to fudge speaking, but with writing I've really got to know
it. I've already done a little writing to Kaitrin in French and I'm
planning on starting with Steph once my French gets a little
stronger. I figure if she's going to come bum around Paris with me
it'll be more fun if she's got the French going on.

So, my presentation as it takes form is at:
  http://odin.himinbi.org/mauritanians/hardware_101.html

One of the many things that I did other than work on it is play with
the stylesheets. If you have a browser that can do it you can change
the stylesheet. (Mozilla, Netscape, Opera, Konquerer, etc. (anything
but IE I think and maybe 6 does it.)) It also has to do the css2
selectors, (which again all but IE do) because each paragraph has a
"lang" attribute and you can change stylesheets to turn different
languages on and off.

Well, it is getting late and I'm only about halfway through. I'm
trying to write something to explain the human psychology ideas of
"short-term" and "long-term" memory so I can use them as analogues. I
ought to get on it.

Love,
Will
