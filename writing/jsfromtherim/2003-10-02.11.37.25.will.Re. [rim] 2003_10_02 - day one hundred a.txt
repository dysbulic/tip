This is true. One cannot completely ignore though the mitigating
circumstances. This country is currently listed as having 0-0.48%
arable land. I can't find the actual statistics, but I am thinking
they have gone from 15 million hectares to under one in the last ten
years or so. The desert is literally consuming this country.

A very small part of this can be contributed to poor ecological
practices, but there have been far more initiatives to combat the
desertification than careless people contributing.

As a result the population of Nouakchott is exploding. This town was
founded in 1960 and designed to hold 200,000 people. It now has likely
more than half of the people in the country because the desert is
making village life impossible. So, the town is younger than my
father and has 1,200,000+ inhabitants. It has driven housing prices
out the roof and labor prices through the floor. As a Nouakchott
volunteer my living allowance is 107,000um; village volunteers get
32,000um.

Another important issue is the ouguiya. Most of North Africa is on the
cfa franc (pronounced "sepha"). It is the "franc de la Communauté
Financière d'Afrique" ("franc of the African Financial Community"). It
is backed by the French Franc and was used in Mauritania until '73.
There was a push to Arabize the country and the separation of currency
was one part of that.

Through the course of the '90's the ouguiya which wasn't backed by
anything in particular fell hard. The drought was a big part of it
combined with civil disputes and fluctuations in the iron market (which
is a big chunk of Mauritania's exports).

I have a guidebook from '84 which lists the ouguiya as trading at
about 55um per dollar. If I went to the market today I'd could get
300um per dollar. Most international trading markets center around the
dollar or euro and this means that as well as a crappy job market
inflation is horrible.

I guess my end point is this. While I certainly agree on the
importance of self-determination and the value of hard work, there are
a variety of very large forces at work in this country. Joe
Mauritanian has a smaller degree of self-determination than you do.

I am not for simple handouts and think that programs like the UN's
"work for food" programs are excellent ideas.

At the same time there is something to the quote "geography is
destiny." I recognize that a very large part of my success as a person
came from my environment. I therefore respect the same fact in those
around me. I really do not think that this country is capable of
supporting itself at this point. Perhaps it will be possible
eventually, but the infrastructure and resources just aren't here right
now. It takes external resources to keep the place going.

I don't think that everyone should just pack up their homes and leave.
Nor do I think that they should just be abandoned to starve. For now I
think that money coming in is the only way to keep people alive and I
am fine with that.

SO, yeah, I agree with your statement, but think that there is another
major perspective that has to be balanced with it.

Interesting Mauritanian facts learned while looking for change in
arable land:
  The name Mauritania actually comes from the word Moor or Maure.
  The international abbreviation for the ouguiya is MRO.
  The French called the country 'Le Grand Vide' ("The Big Nothing")
  "Weather between December and March in the capital Nouakchott is
    nearly perfect, with maximums averaging 29°C (85°F) and overnight
    lows of 13°C (55°F)." Sweet.
  The "White Moors" are more properly called the "Bidan."
  The "Black Moors" are more properly called the "Harattin."
