Will,

    I want to express a little concern over this package business.
Your grandmother was in Kingsport yesterday and spoke to the postal
person there who said you should have the package in 7 days with the
rates we have chosen to send your goodies. In other words in
Mauritania in 7 days. I am beginning to wonder if it is a good idea to
tell the complete truth about what is in the packages. Jill suggested
instead of putting candy to put snacks. Any suggestions from anyone
would be appreciated. Also, your grandmother mailed some of the French
books yesterday. I don't mind contributing to people in need but I
think of you as the contribution and our job to keep you healthy and
somewhat happy while this country gets the benefit of your knowledge.
In other words, those Sugar Babies are for you and you then may choose
with whom you wish to share. I am looking for suggestions so I may
feel better about this. If you have read others accounts of this type
of situation and how others overcame their concerns, please let me
know. Also, can you check to see if they are holding some packages? It
couldn't hurt!! I am encouraging you to take some proactive steps
here.

Much love,
Auntie Sharon
