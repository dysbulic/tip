Just a note on mail...

My address will stay the same after the Stage. All that changes is I
go from a PCT to a PCV. =)

So far envelopes have had a far higher success rate than boxes. I've
personally not gotten anything other than envelopes and the one USPS
box that I know of coming thorough was relieved of all the food items.
There have been FedEx and UPS boxes that came though, but they cost an
arm and a leg. =)

I still want someone to try and send me some French lit via a mbag. It
is supposedly $16 for 11 pounds and it can be any media sorts of
things. There are surprisingly few books in French here. I figured the
PCV's would want to read French to work on their proficiency, but
there's not really anything here. So far I've seen Le Petit Prince and
L'Enfant Noir.

Anyhow, just figured I'd let everyone know how to continue to get
ahold of me. =)

Love,
Will
