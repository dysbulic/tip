Disturbing anecdote for the day. Yesterday while I was sitting talking
with the Gambian fellow a car runs off the road and into a stand
across the street.

Normally this would be at least slightly understandable. Traffic here
is just crazy. Today I had to cross a busy highway and I eventually
managed to make it across. I was then almost squished because a taxi
decided that the traffic was too heavy and so he was going to drive on
the side of the road.

Things close down here for a little siesta in the middle of the day. I
remember a comedian making fun of Mexico for approving a national
siesta time. They've never lived in a desert without the benefit of
air conditioning obviously.

So, we were at the tail end of break time and there were hardly any
cars on a big paved road. This guy goes driving off the side, over a
bunch of African drums and into a big glass fronted bureau with some
art in it. He managed not to hit anyone, but he completely destroyed
the stand.

This in itself was not really disturbing. It sucked that all the stuff
was broken, but no one was hurt. Well, then the driver just backs up
and drives off. I asked the guy I was sitting with, "What's he doing?
Doesn't he need to give the guy some information or money or
something?" To which he replied, "He's white [Arab], he doesn't have
to do anything."

I've not really been seeing the racial differences here much other
than when I'm walking home or to the bureau (I now walk pretty much
all the time) I see alot more black faces on foot than white ones.
Definitely when a pass a bunch of guys out digging a ditch they'll be
black 99% of the time.

I think there's alot more thinking and writing to be done on the topic
or race, but for now I'll leave it at the anecdote.

Love,
Will
