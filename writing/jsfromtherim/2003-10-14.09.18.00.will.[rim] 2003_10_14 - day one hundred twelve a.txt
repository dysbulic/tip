Ahh, the glories of air conditioning. =) I'm still bikeless, but I care 
less when it is a balmy 89 degrees.

I was wondering as I was walking over this morning if any of you 
wondered where I get my numbers from when quoting temperatures like 108 
or 95 or whatever. My watch has a thermometer on it and so I'm not just 
making random numbers up. (Just in case you wondered.)

The catch though, since there is always a catch here... They overloaded 
the circuit for the room with the new air conditioner. This means that 
the price for the nice cool air in here is that this computer will now 
turn off randomly. I suppose I just need not to do anything too 
important. A small price to pay.

I just got through wandering around on a tour with the Director of the 
UN Volunteers. Malick was showing her what goes on here and I went with 
them to take the tour again. It made about 75% sense this time as 
opposed to the 25% it made when I took it two months ago.

Speaking of unintelligible rendezvous, I had dinner with a friend of 
Malick's last night who is the head of the NGO (Non-Governmental 
Organization), Actions in Favor of the Environment. They do 
anti-desertification stuff as well as general sustainability of life in 
the countryside. We were doing alright initially, but he eventually got 
warmed up and proceeded to leave me behind. The dinner was really good. 
Chicken and rice with peas on a bed of shredded carrots. Much better 
than the cookies and reconstituted milk I had the night before. =)

I'm getting a little braver with my French, or at least a little more 
willing to impose on those around me with my bad French.

Our most recent development here is the coordinator for the Academy has 
resigned. So, our status is:
   1. No coordinator. (The coordinator being the "boss" of the place and 
the liaison between any other organizations.)
   2. No teachers. (One teacher being the now resigned coordinator and 
the other being in France for a couple months still.)
   3. A one month course to train teachers maybe being taught starting 
in November.
   4. All PCV's in regional capitols (including potential teachers Matt 
and myself) attending conferences in sparsely populated areas the 
5th-12th of November. (The national election being the 7th.)
   5. The UN volunteer, Malick, the one person with a clue, having his 
contract come up November 10.
   6. 90 students supposedly starting classes around the 15th of November.

In short it has gone past bleak to almost comically insurmountable. No 
one has died yet and the university hasn't burnt down, but other than 
that not much else is left to go wrong. I'm not stressing over it since 
there's really not anything I can do. The one possibility the worries me 
is that Malick will not find the money for an extension, the university 
will not find a new coordinator, and either the Academy will die or 
someone will expect me to have a clue/

I'm not opposed to being clueful, but discussing the weather is 
currently a challenge. Wheeling and dealing within the infrastructure of 
the university is so far beyond my abilities it isn't even funny. We can 
ship Matt in though. Hopefully it won't come to that.

Love,
Will
