Last night was not a good night. I think that all the bug thoughts right 
before bed was imprudent. I woke up about halfway through the night 
dreaming that there were big bugs all over me. Interestingly today I 
learned that in addition to really vivid dreams methlquine also inhibits 
melanin production in some way, so I won't be getting a tan. I was 
wondering why all the volunteers were as light as they are, living in 
Africa and all, and that is apparently the reason.

I talked to a current PCV about the bug we saw and he said that when the 
locals see them they don't really react. When they see a scorpion though 
they go scattering, so apparently whatever they are they aren't terribly 
dangerous.

The difficult thing about dreaming about giant bugs and then going to 
sleep on the floor in a place that has giant bugs and no doors is there is 
no guarantee that said giant bugs won't come in to visit. I really did not 
sleep at all well last night. I took several naps during the day though 
and I am feeling alright now.

We had a neat cultural show today. They had little stations under 
different trees where different local practices were being shown. There 
was a blacksmith that had a bellows made of two leather sacks that I 
thought was really creative. I wonder how much they produce on their own 
and how much is imported. There was also our tea guy out there showing how 
he made the tea. There was frozen yogurt as well. Not the sort in the 
States, but a little plastic bag of yogurt that was stuck in the freezer. 
There was also a local dish called something with a b and made with 
hibiscus flowers or baobab fruit.

There was a fellow making talismans which are called gregres in 
French. Apparently something special is written on some paper and then 
folded and wrapped in leather and stitched up. It wards against an "evil 
eye" which can happen when someone admires you. An interesting cultural 
note is his examples were "he's so tall" or "she's so fat." Largeness is 
valued in women here because it bespeaks of wealth. I wonder if the 
superstitions behind the charms have and basis in Islam (I am assuming 
not) and what the local religions were like that gave rise to them.

The neatest thing of all though was the drumming and dancing. There wasn't 
alot of form to most of it, but there was certainly vigor. =) Some 
volunteers got out and cut a rug, (umm, some sand) but I was not quite 
brave enough (and it was still 90+ degrees).

Got to talk a little bit more to the philosophy major. Pretty cool and 
very interesting to talk to. Something feels a little off though. I feel 
though like I am making some good friends though. People that I can come 
to and confide in when things are tough. I'm not sure how spread out we 
will be and how much chance I will have to be with other people. I suppose 
I'll start learning that soon.

The amount of structure still makes this feel a whole lot like summer 
camp. Things are almost certainly going to change though. Statistically 
40% of us will be gone by the time stage ends. I feel pretty good about 
our group and think we could well beat that curve, but I think that this 
next transition will really start to separate things out. I'll be hanging 
in mashallah (God willing).

Oh yeah, one last thing. At the end they did the night prayer out in the 
open so that we could watch. Then we talked some about it. It was notable 
that it was only men praying. Women cannot lead prayer and so can't pray 
by themselves. If they do pray with men then they have to stand at the 
back so as to not distract the men. Little kids start praying around 5-6 
years old. There are different sets of different types of prayers, but I 
didn't catch all of that.

I've been wearing my Jesus fish hat. I have been telling people that I am 
a Taoist though. It really is alot closer to how I believe, so I figured I 
might as well make it official. I tried explaining the hat though and why 
I was wearing it. It really does make sense to me on several levels. For 
one I am not without a sense of irony and to be mistaken for a Christian 
when I am no longer foremost claiming to be panders to that. Also, I still 
do consider myself a Christian even though many Christians would disagree. 
I really like the religion I grew up with except for some of the more 
intolerant bits.

Finding someone with whom to discuss the nuances is something I think I am 
seeking. I feel like mentor at TTU spoiled me because I got to be around 
so many people skilled at introspection and understanding applied 
psychology both internally and externally. I really like these people, but 
those skills are ones that it takes practice to develop and alot of people 
haven't had opportunity to practice.

Anyhow, someone is showing a movie on their laptop so I am going to go 
check it out.

Love,
Will
