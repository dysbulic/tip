I have been wandering the internet looking for a particular word I am
pretty sure exists but can't find. It is for when you perform an
action without conscious thought. Not the sort of autonomic (right
word?) response like yanking your hand off the stove. Also not a
conditioned behavior a la Skinner et. al. Anyone know the term I am
hunting for?

A good example is something both my mom and Steph have done to me
while riding in the car. Something will happen that makes it look like
an accident is impending and their right arm would come out
instantaneously to hold me back in my seat. Certainly faster than the
conscious decision process to try and keep me from going through the
windshield. It was a warming gesture if a bit absurd since I outweigh
either one of them by a good fifty pounds.

When I was teaching Steph to drive I worked at instilling in her a
certain response, and that was if there is uncertainty of any sort
your foot should be on the brake before you even realize it. Nine
times out of ten it is far better to be going slower rather than
faster when headed into a possible accident.

The one notable exception that she was still working on when I left
was merging and changing lanes. Slowing down in those situations is
just a good way to get hit.

Last night I learned that at least some Mauritanians have similar
instincts. Unfortunately the fellow who came to an abrupt stop did so
because he had just realized he had pulled directly in front of me. I
managed to walk away with nothing more than some scrapes and a front
tire bent in the shape of an "L."

To my fault I was expending far too much thought on whether I wanted
to stop for a burger and far too little on paying attention
considering that I was riding through the world's larger bumper cart
rink.

My house is fairly a crossroads and it it at least once a week that I
hear the screech of tires and crunch of metal. You'd think that people
would at least slow down a bit when coming to major intersection.
Granted the stop sign has as of yet to be discovered here, so perhaps
that is the cause.

Anyhow, I got a new tire at the bureau and proceeded to a quite
enjoyable Risk game at Obie's where I was mostly successful at not
getting blood on anything too terribly important. I spent a brief and
shining three rounds as Royal Emperor of Africa before Carl embroiled
myself and South America in an arduous war of attrition ending with
the eventual demise of both our peoples. His died first though and
that made it all worthwhile. =)

Love,
Will

P.S. In French you would say, "J'ai fait un accident, Je suis rentr√©
dans une voiture." Or literally, "I made an accident. I returned in a
car." Okie. Sure.
