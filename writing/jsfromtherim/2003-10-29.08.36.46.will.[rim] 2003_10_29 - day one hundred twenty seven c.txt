This is a horrible country for cats. A couple weeks ago there were
four volunteers with kittens. One kitten got stepped on, one got in a
fight and killed, one was killed by village children and one is still
alive. Marc found a group of kittens under a bush near his house and
nursed them back from the brink of death feeding them from a syringe.
Now they have stopped eating and he is contemplating either letting
them waste away or killing them.

If you'd asked me things I'm likely to be doing in Mauritania, killing
kittens would never have made the list...

I'd enjoy having a cat, but the young ones have a really high
mortality rate and the old ones run at the sight of people. I was
planning on taking one of Marc's when they were a bit bigger, but now
it doesn't look like that'll be possible.

Maybe once I get settled in I'll hunt some more and something will
turn up. Every day I get a little closer to settled here. Really all
that is left is starting cooking and starting teaching. Now if we can
just not have a coup after the election that'd be great. =)

Love,
Will
