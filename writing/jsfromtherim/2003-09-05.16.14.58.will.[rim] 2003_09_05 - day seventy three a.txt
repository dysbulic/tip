Ok, the name for what we do when we go hide is "consolidate." I know
because we are now consolidated. I really should have seen it coming.
This is our last weekend and model school has just ended. (The ed
PCT's do a school with classes of around 70 where they are actually
teaching English.) This afternoon PC people came by to drop off food
at the house where one of the facilitators works. I just didn't get
two and two together. =)

So Robert and I are spending the night at chez Habib. They both went
to bed a while ago and I've been trying to hunt down what was up with
my mail.

Habib did a pretty tasty dinner with some pasta and some mutton and
veggies. If I can manage to prepare food of this caliber on the little
gas burners that most people cook with then I'll be happy. After that
we sat around and chatted for a bit. All in all a pleasant evening.

Sometimes in class I get frustrated with Habib's teaching style and
might want to do him a bit of bodily harm, but he's a nice enough
fellow.

I got into the ChocoMousse and bisquit (cookies) while I was working
and I think I am now going to be ill. =) I ate too much sweetness.

Oh, I did have a moment of wanting to harm Habib tonight. He asked me
if I'd make the tea after dinner and I agreed. This is the second time
now that I've prepared tea in Mauritania. It is done putting actual
tea in a pot and boiling the lot of it with mint and sugar, so it does
require a little bit of skill. So, I made the tea and he was happy
with the first glass. It is consumed in three rounds drunk out of
shot glasses. The second pot though was sweeter and he said it was too
sweet and wouldn't drink it.

I thought that was kinda rude. I mean, it took me a good 10 minutes to
make that cup of tea. You put the tea and the water together. Then you
boil the water. Then you take it off and add the sugar and mint. You
reboil. Then you pour a glass full of tea and alternate pouring it
back and forth to put a head on the glass. (As Habib said "tea without
foam isn't real tea.") Finally you put the tea back and give it one
more heating before serving. This is before each round.

The tea that he wouldn't drink was no sweeter that the sweet tea that
you'd get at most restaurants in the south. I went ahead and drank
both of them since I thought it was alright.

I still think Habib is a waste of a perfectly good Victorian woman. =)

Love,
Will
