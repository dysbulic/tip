I'm leaving in a minute to go try and get this stuff sent off, so I 
thought I would go through the notes that I have been making in the 
margins of my French on things to write about.

If I repeat something I apologize. I have had massive amounts of French 
coming in and it is really wreaking havoc with my memory. What I wrote 
about and what I only thought about writing is blurred.

We have class lying under a big permanent tent with a cloth roof. There
are almost no tables and very few chairs. Everything takes place on the
floor. There are goats, short-hair sheep, cows and donkeys wandering
around the streets. The goats are particularly adventurous and even though
many are hobbled by having a front and a back leg tied together they still
scale walls five feel high and traipse along the top. Every so often one
will jump down into Habib's yard and he will have to chase it out.

There aren't houses here really. There are "compounds" which is a wall 
five or six feet high with rooms inside opening onto a common sitting 
yard. It gets very hot inside during the day so most people sit outside 
under tents or occasionally a tree.

The other day Habib sang me a Michael W. Smith song. Smith is a 
contemporary Christian artist, but the language or the song was very 
generic. We are united by our love and our faith sorts of things. I 
thought that it as cool of him to try and talk to me in my language.

So far nobody has even broached the subject of religion. I have a Jesus 
fish hat that I will likely eventually wear, but not until I have 
sufficient conversational skills to understand what people are saying to 
me.

Habib told us about restaurants. He said that you go in and they bring you 
a large menu then you order and they say, "sorry, we are out of that." You 
just go through choices until you get to couscous or rice. =)

Strangely yesterday we did every simple tense in French. There are seven
of them. The day before we learned how to say eraser and book. So we can 
now identify simple object and conjugate the present subjunctive. OK.

For supper one night we had tapioca. At least that is what I thought it
was. Apparently it is a very large couscous in a sweet cream sort of 
sauce. If you switched it with tapioca though no one would be the wiser.
We also have a very fine couscous called baassi. If you mixed sand with 
water then you'd be at the right consistency. It is not my favorite meal, 
but beggars, as they say, can't be choosers.

Love,
Will
