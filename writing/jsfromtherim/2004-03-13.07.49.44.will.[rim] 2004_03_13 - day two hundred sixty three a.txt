I think there will likely come a point in every volunteer's service
when they would give serious thought to trading a part of their
anatomy for a bottle of water.

If for instance you were working in a strange town and you were
suddenly attacked gastronomically by the change in water. Having
expected this you would calmly head to the restroom. Imagine your fear
and revulsion as you turn on the water to fill the makaresh and
nothing more than a gurgle comes out.

This is Mauritania mind you. A place that has tables and chairs is a
fairly upscale establishment. When I take my garbage out it is
descended upon by a throng of street urchins seeking such valuables as
plastic bottles. There's not many consumables left lying about to be
appropriated. The nearest store with water is a half mile away. In
short the situation looks bleak...

Fortunately you happen across a quarter bottle of windex dropped
behind a desk. God has chosen to look favorably upon you today.

Not shake using my left hand? Hell, at this point I'm not especially
pleased about having it attached to my wrist let alone touching
anything with it.

Love,
Will
