Subject: [rim] The Bestest Auntie Ever

Oh my, oh my... I am sitting here up to my eyeballs in jelly beans.
There's a warm happy feeling in my heart and a big smile on my face.
Why? Because my Aunt Sharon, to quote myself as I was emptying her
most recent care package, "fuckin' rocks!"

It is late and I am headed to bed, but I just wanted everyone to know
what I very special Auntie I am so very lucky to have in my life. Not
that you can buy my affections or anything... Hell, who am I kidding?
I'm all yours Sharon, forget the rest of them. They left me to wither
in the desert with nary a jelly bean, but not you. You rock.

Love,
Will
