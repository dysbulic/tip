Thanksgiving was nearly all I could have hoped for. It was lacking my 
family, of course, but I did stuff myself until I couldn't move anymore. 
  There were about 30 of un at Obie's so there wasn't a quite place to 
take a nap, but there was alot of interesting conversation. Also there 
were no pineapples and cheese (since this country is without cheddar), 
but there were finally chocolate chip cookies.

I had my grandma's pineapples and cheese recipe on the web and I appear 
to have changed it into a poulty rub recipe. A google search returns my 
mom's poulty rub as the second result on a search for "pineapples and 
cheese." I guess I meant to copy it and overwrote it instead...

Ok, I fixed it, go make, eat and try to psychically communicate the 
experience of:

   http://odin.himinbi.org/pineapples_and_cheese.html

We had about a dozen chicken. No turkey, but I wasn't complaining. One 
thing I had never had for Thanksgiving but which was my favorite part of 
the meal was biscuits and sawmill gravy. I didn't know it, but I think I 
was suffering a grave gravy deficiency. =)

I made a cookie and saved it for my landlord. I forgot it though and it 
is probably still nicely wrapped in aluminum foil sitting at Obie's.

I also learned what happens when you screw up yogurt. It was shortly 
before I learned where cheese comes from and just how gross a bucket 
with two gallons of spoiled milk is. It is also true that really no 
quantity of sugar can make spoiled milk taste like a yummy treat.

The whole next day I didn't eat at all. It was great.

Love,
Will
