Well, I once again discovered the dangers of having food and a good
book within arms reach of my bed yesterday. I also learned it takes me
about nine hours to read 400 pages.

Daniel Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha is a pretty entertaining book. I'd
give it around a 7/10. It would have done alot better if not for the
ending. It is a fictional account of the life of a geisha and up until
the very end I could have believed that it was the account of a real
person. It finishes though by tying everything up in a pretty little
bow that flattens the previous vividity of the characters' humanity.

Still it was an entertaining read if for nothing else the historical
information on the lives of geisha around the time of WWII. There is
also occasionally some entertaining dialog and wordplay.

I also finished up The Gandhi Reader, but I want to hold off talking
about it until I can bring it in and quote some passages.

Love,
Will

P.S. I made it by the bank and am once again a well financed man about
town. I took out some extra money for going to WAIST and right now I
am carrying 100,000um. If I were to change it to dollars it would be
about $300, but it sounds so much more impressive to have 100,000um
than to have $300. Now I get to go exchange money. It has all the
usual confrontation of bargaining except when you start talking to one
money changer there will be suddenly ten around you all shouting
various rates. It is great fun in that being lynched sort of way.
