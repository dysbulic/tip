You don't know what it is to feel dirty until you go through a night with
horrible diarrhea and a "turkish toilet" in 90 degree heat. I've not had
much other than water in the last day, and four or five times last night
that is what I had to get up and evacuate from my body. It didn't take its
usual, relatively convenient, path though; instead choosing a much more
odoriferous path.

And I can't stop drinking. The dehydration will not only prolong the 
disease, but the nurse told us the story of an older volunteer who had a 
heart attack after her blood thickened because she choose to stop drinking 
to stop her diarrhea.

The other thing is that there isn't a usual place for the makaresh (butt 
pot as it is called by the PC.) I kept getting up and needing it and 
someone would have moved it. That time spent in search was often time that 
I didn't have. That and our water comes from next door, so if it is all 
gone it takes a trip with a bucket next door to get more. That didn't 
happen mashallah.

(I think I mistranslated earlier. Mashallah is "Thanks be to God" and 
inshallah is "God willing". Inshallah can be used either when describing a 
plan like: "I am going to Senegal, inshallah", or as sort of a "knock on 
wood": "Things are peaceful here politically, inshallah".)

About the fourth time at around 3:30am I lay there for a good 5 minutes 
and contemplated simply soiling myself. After that episode (I decided 
against sacrificing my undies) I took a couple of the pepto bismol tablets 
from the medkit and made it to the morning.

Love,
Will
