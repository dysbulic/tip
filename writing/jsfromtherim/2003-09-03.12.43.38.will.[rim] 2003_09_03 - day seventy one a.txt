I'm planning at some point to get all these journals up on the
internet. (Actually it is a dream of mine to create a site to make
blogging easier for PCV's around the world. They face interesting
issues in that accessing the web can be next to impossible, and most
blogs have only web interfaces.)

For my afternoon class though Habib and I are going to visit the
cybercafé and I'm going to give him a short course on the web in
French. I realized though that when I get these up on the web there's
only one person I've bitched about in them and that is him. I've been
contentious about the fact that any and all the PCV's and the PC
official might read, but not so much for Habib. =)

It really is the most public forum possible. Accessible anywhere at
anytime (provided you don't live in Kaédi).

Love,
Will
