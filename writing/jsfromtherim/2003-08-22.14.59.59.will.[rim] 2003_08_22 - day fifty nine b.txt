Last night I tried to explain the chorus to the song "Sailing Away" 
knowing only the words for boat (bateau) and the verb to leave (partir) 
and in a language which doesn't use the present participle anywhere near 
as much as English. Honestly I screwed it up but I did manage to 
communicate the much simpler "Lady in Red." Apparently these songs are by 
the same person, Christabel? I recognize the songs but have no idea who 
sings them. According to my host father the fellow is famous across 
Mauritania, and he has a whole tape with nothing but his songs.

Steph called last night. It was my first real call and it was nice to 
have. The annoying thing though is that there were pauses of anywhere 
between two to ten seconds between speaking and the other party hearing. 
It was at 8:00 on a Thursday night (start of the weekend here), so I bet 
the network was pretty heavily loaded.

My speaking seemed to get lost in the ether about 20% of the time. I am 
pretty sure I was receiving fine though. She is going to give me a call 
tonight at midnight and we'll see if it works better.

In other news I was cleaning my room this morning and happened upon a
little scorpion. There are very few things that I have seen universally
feared here, and they are one. This one just sat patiently, and I was
going to take a picture of it, but my father noticed it and squished it
before I got a chance. It was a sand colored scorpion which I think are
the last dangerous. Supposedly they'll hurt like a son of a bitch, but I
won't need serious medical attention. There are red ones which are worse
and black ones (that supposedly don't live here) that if you are stung by
your best bet is to use your remaining time to make peace with the maker 
you will soon be meeting.

Love,
Will
