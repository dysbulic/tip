This is the last night before we head out to the great unknown. They did 
little skits today about what it may be like being out on our own. It 
looks like it will be a hell of an experience. There have been PCV's 
hanging around and there is some look that all of them have to them. I 
almost think that I could pick one of them out of a lineup. There is a 
sense of security and self reliance that is really cool.

I forgot to mention about the culture fair that several of the girls got 
henna done. I saw it in Key West and for the uninitiated it is just 
patterns on the skin made by exposing it to a ground up henna plant. It 
leaves a dark brown stain and the patterns can be very intricate.

A couple of trainees put together a talent show tonight. We sat around and 
sang folk songs out of the Hootenanny book. It was entertaining. Carl did 
an interpretive dance called Le Debutante de la Corps de la Paix. It was 
very entertaining to watch his antics. He moved well though. The PCV's did 
some silliness and also showed a powerpoint on "Dating in the RIM." 
Apparently the last group had quite a few people hook up though no one that 
I know of out of this group has.

Something just feels off right now. I think part of it is nervousness 
about tomorrow, but more so it is dissatisfaction with the relationships 
that I am forming. I know that it has only been a week, but I don't feel 
like I am really getting into emotional depth. Maybe it is just me. There 
are some cool guys in our group and I am not one of them. I feel a certain 
drive to try and be that way because I know that people can tell and that 
people care. At the same time maybe my lack of depth is just coming from 
pretending to be someone I'm not.

Perhaps it is only projection, but the independence in the PCV's really 
does seem to remove them from that. I imagine being the only person of 
your race and culture for 100 miles does foster a bit of self-reliance. 
Maybe going into this with things unsettled will help me find a new depth.

I still feel like I am not pulling my weight because the agfo and ee
people will be in the middle of the desert doing the hard work while I
piddle with computers.

Anyhow. I think I'll let the laptop charge a bit and get some sleep. 
Tomorrow is a big day.

Love,
Will
