Just a little job update...

Last time I checked in we had two teachers. One in France for the next
three months and the other with a new job at the UNDP. Well, today I
learned they have 90 students waiting to take classes. Also that they
are going to be able to send us to Dakar to get trained (and before
classes begin even). =)

The catches (there are always catches):
  1. There are four semesters of Cisco training to become a Cisco
      Certified Network Associate (CCNA). Each semester is 3 months at
      6 hours a week. To pass our training exam we have to pass those
      CCNA exams as well as some other exams. The teacher trainings
      last one week per semester (that would be three months
      compressed into a week). Generally teachers have already had the
      class, so this is just a week of pedagogy and review.
  2. Classes start on October 28th, so there's only time for us to
      take the training for semesters one and two.
  3. The University needs semesters two and three taught. There are
      people who can't graduate because these classes aren't being
      taught.
  4. Matt and Carl are in Nouadhibou right now working to get some
      micro-finance institutions on-line. They are pretty occupied and
      they'd rather not leave right now.

So, the plan right now is to try and find someone to teach the
semester three and for just me to go to Dakar. It'll have me teaching
12 hours a week which is just fine with me.

To spice things up a bit I got a letter from the Country Director of
Senegal detailing recent robberies. It includes hints for avoiding
trouble like "common trouble signs are things like seeing crowds
pulling people from cars and the smell of tear gas in the air."
Yippee.

Honestly I know that Nouakchott is a safe place to be all in all and
my behavior reflects it. From what I have heard of Dakar I could find
serious trouble there, so I will be alot more careful. I'm hunting now
to find some Senegal volunteers so hopefully I can learn a bit before
arriving.

Love,
Will
