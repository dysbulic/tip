_ABHoE_ is a completely inadequate (and relatively atheoretical) book.
SES is the real mind-baker. :)  it should take at least several months to
read.

wilbEr, btw.

i have been reading bits of wilber's _no boundary_.  that particular book,
almost 30 years old and only 150 pages, is the only one of his that i've
read in which it would be blindingly obvious to most readers that he and
connie are gnawing on the same set of problems.

[i think i've now read all but one of the books wilber has written - why
anyone would be interested in reading _Boomeritis_ completely eludes me.]

it all depends on which segment of indian society, i think.  one of my
indian officemates speaks better english than most of the native speakers
i know- complete with euphemisms and slang-words like "grok".

i really liked Magister Ludi.  it is a very ENTP-ish book, in my opinion.
the most important bit of it that i can remember is his struggle for his
own humanity.
