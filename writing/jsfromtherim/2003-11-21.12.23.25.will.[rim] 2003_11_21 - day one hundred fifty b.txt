I just wanted to post a little bit on the randomness here.

I've mentioned before the dirty fellow who comes up to me sometimes
and tells me about his sick baby and tries to get me to go to the
pharmacy with him to buy medicine.

He has found me a few times and he is generally one of the dirtier
people I've seen. I gave him 1000um the first time jut because he
really did look hard on his luck and convincing.

I have run into him a couple more times (over the course of a month)
and his story is the same. I figured he was just scamming me after a
bit because his kid would either have gotten better or died by this
point.

Well, yesterday I am headed out of my house and he comes up to me
again. This time he has a bona fide child complete with dried snot on
his face. He proceeds to show me the kid and emphasize the snot so
that I can fully understand the extent of the child's illness.

He let me go with a surprisingly small amount of effort. I told him I
had to go to work and that I didn't want to give him money. He just
let me go. I was pleased not to go through the usual "not today," "but
my baby is so sick, he goes 'cough, cough' all the time," "not
today..."

He revealed to me that he is a foreigner as well. That is why it has
been so hard to get a job. (Which I believe, so much here operates
based on personal relationships.) It turns out he comes from Western
Sahara.

Well, I'm gonna go take a nap. I stayed up too late last night playing
with math.

Love,
Will
