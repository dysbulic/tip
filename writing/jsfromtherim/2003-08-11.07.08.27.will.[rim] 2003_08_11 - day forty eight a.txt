I just wanted to mention a note about calling cards. They are apparently 
the cheapest way generally for people in the U.S. to call Mauritania. I'm 
not sure how the process works, but apparently the call sort of bounces 
through a couple places. It affects reliability some, but you are calling 
Africa after all, so that is really part and parcel.

The websites that I have had recommended are:

Clifton Telecard Alliance (http://www.ctacard.com/) which has a 115 minute 
Hello Africa card for $20 ($.17/min) and 104 minute CTA Africa for $20 
($.19/min). (Both might be useful because both don't break always at the 
same time.) Also, from the site:

  "Semi monthly maintenance fees of $0.59 will be assessed after the first 
   call. Calls placed to mobile telephones may be billed at a higher 
   rate, 3 minute rounding. This card has no cash value and is 
   non-refundable. Prices and fees are subject to change without notice."

Kristen, who gets calls regularly, says that the cells run the same rate.	

There is also a "Hello Mauritania" from nobelcom 
(http://www.nobelcom.com), but it seems like the rate is higher ($.20/min) 
the rounding is higher (4min) and the maintenance fee is higher 
($.99/week). Seems like the other is a better deal, but maybe there are 
reasons (like reliability) to go with this.

All incoming cell phone calls are free of course and outgoing calls are 
crazy mad expensive. Somewhere around 150um/min = $.80/min. Not many of us 
have numbers currently. The lists are growing and are at:

Mark Valentin bought an Alcatel phone for 21kum and that was supposedly a 
little pricey because he got it in Ka√©di. There are a wide variety, but I 
don't speak French well enough to shop. =)

P.S. If you know of anyone who doesn't get this, have them check their 
bulk mailbox because it is a listserv and might be picked up as spam.
