I spent most of the morning ferrying Miriam and Jen around Nouakchott. 
They were wanting to do some shopping, so I figured I'd try and save 
them the trouble I had finding anything in this great sprawling mass of 
a city.

Last night I finally made it over to Matt's place. I left on Thursday 
planning on it but ended up staying at Marc's after dancing and then 
sleeping at Melanie and Heather's hotel the next night. It was 
definitely time for me to change clothes by the time I made it home. =)

The place is looking more attractive location wise. This morning I got 
out and wandered around and saw the boutiques and restaurants in the 
area. Everything is a little farther away; a block as opposed to 
actually in the same building, but not bad. The selection is definitely 
better.

When we got here Marc and I heard a talk of a black currant Fanta that 
supposedly tasted like Dr. Pepper. I've been keeping an eye out for it 
and so has Marc. He found a drink called "red fruits" Fanta that was 
apparently discontinued and contained currants. We assumed that was the 
mythic drink and hopes were abandoned. Today I found the real thing and 
bought a couple that I'm going to visit with Marc and give a shot. The 
many Fantas of Mauritania are:

   Orange Fanta: pretty much Slice
   Strawberry Fanta: very sweet strawberry drink
   Green Apple Fanta: also quite sweet
   Lemon Fanta: not bad, in the neighborhood of carbonated Country Time
   Black Currant Fanta: rumored to be Dr. Pepperesque, a mystery
   Red Fruits Fanta: only to be found dusty and flat, fruit punch sorta

Love,
Will
