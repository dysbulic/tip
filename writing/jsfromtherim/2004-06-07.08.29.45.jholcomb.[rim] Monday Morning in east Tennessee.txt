Paris how romantic and what an adventure - This note is a request that
Sonja write me so I can tell Mrs. Lawson that I heard from you guys.
She is certain that there is a lot of potential for catastrophic
problems.  Have  great time take lots of pictures keep a diary of daily
activities I want to experience as much of your trip I can.  Jim
