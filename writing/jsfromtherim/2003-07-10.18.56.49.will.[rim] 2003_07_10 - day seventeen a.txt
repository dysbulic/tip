Oh God, I am sick. Last night at supper I had no appetite at all and this 
morning during class I shat myself empty and lie delirious on the floor 
for half an hour. I tried drinking some more and in another half an hour 
it left via my ass. They gave us some salts to drink when trying to 
hydrate and I am giving those a try now.

They told us to expect a variety of types of diarrheal and the virulent 
types only last a couple days unless they are amoebic or giraldial.

The ambassador is in town from visiting with Bush in Senegal and we are 
meeting him at 4. There will be a nurse there and I'll visit with her 
perhaps. There's really not much that can be done. Unless it is bacterial 
I just wait it out.

Yum, chlorinated salt water. Maybe some apple cider will make it tastier. 
Steph hid them around my bag (which was very cool) and I have been trying 
to use them sparingly.

Oh God, I think that this is what baby puke in water would taste like. 
Bottoms up.

Speaking of Steph, last night I had a dream that stage was only an intro 
and I got to visit home to say goodbye before doing my service. Steph and 
I were lying on my parents bed talking and I was bawling because I didn't 
want to go.

Really this is among the more difficult experiences I have had. Each 
moment is in itself bearable, but it is just a continual string of 
bearable moments. It is like a sadistic reality show. We are going to take 
you and drop you in the desert with a bunch of people you can't talk to. 
You are expected to form relationships with them and improve their way of 
life. Just to make things interesting you will shit in a hole in the 
ground, wipe your ass with your hand, bathe out of a bucket and be 
infected with massively productive diarrheal. Oh yeah, and your prize is 
losing two years of your life and a marginal chance that you might 
accomplish something meaningful.

There I go again, spouting that Peace Corps rhetoric. =) I sound like a 
commercial. I read online about a guy being asked to pull his journals 
because they were negative. I wonder what I will do if they ask me to not 
put this stuff up. Right now, what are they going to threaten to do, send 
me home? Oh God, please no. =)

It has been said though, and I agree, that the people that make it out of 
this can make it out of damn near anything short of a war (inshallah 
(which can also mean "knock on wood")).

I also do expect for things to improve. According to the other volunteers I 
can expect sporadic diarrheal for the next two years, but that it true 
around the world. The heat is not unbearable really and eventually I 
should be able to speak to someone.

I'm definitely not leaving. I am not happy, but I haven't learned how to 
converse at all and I have only been at this a week. The strangest thing 
perhaps is that I don't really feel challenged. I am uncomfortable as I 
ever have been and I really miss the mountains, but it is just like I have 
alot of work to do.

I think part of it is that this is almost like a game. I know that the 
next 9 weeks are prestuctured for me and all I have to do is stay on task. 
After that perhaps I will have to be more self reliant and it will be more 
challenging. Also, knowing that at any time I can say "screw you guys, I'm 
going home" takes the pressure off. There are several safety nets and I am 
comfortable trusting them. (inshallah)

Love,
Will
