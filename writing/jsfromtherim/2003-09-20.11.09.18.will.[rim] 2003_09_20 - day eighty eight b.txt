I've been walking. Alot. (Steph reminds me from time to time "alot"
isn't a word. I remember. It should be though. Beaucoup in French has
the sense that alot is used in English. Supposedly the word "lot" can
mean "many" but I can't come up with a sentence where it means that
when not preceded by "a." "Lots" can means that, but in the singular
it generally means "the entire collection." What are other words like
this?)

So, anyway, about the walking... Have you ever seen The Family Circus
where it will show the path that the kid takes from point A to point B
via a couple dozen stops in a big circle? That's me in Nouakchott. I
go from Rhonda's over to the Sosiem Market and then the Moroccan
Mosque and eventually wander by the French Embassy and after a while
arrive at the PC Bureau. The difference is I am wandering because I
don't know where I'm going.

The other differences being my circles wander over a couple miles,
it's 100+ degrees and I can't ask directions of half the people around
me. It's been a fun learning experience.

Alot of my walking has been at night since I don't leave the bureau
when it's really to outside. When wandering around the darkened
streets at night it gives me time to contemplate safety issues.

We've had two murders here in Nouakchott in the week. Both were
nationals and both happened in Tavragh Zeina. One was a fellow walking
around with a million ougias and someone strangled him for it. The
other was a group of guys who met up in a hotel to do something with
money changing. Something went awry and one group beat the other up,
with one fellow being beaten to death.

In many ways even though Sokogim PS is a poorer part of town it is
safer for that reason. There are so many people crammed into so small
of a space that it is literally impossible to be alone. The general
populace here is honest and I've found people to be good natured. When
I'm walking through neighborhoods I usually feel like the people
around me would help me out if something went awry.

Tavragh Zeina is much wealthier and much less populous. It is the
arrondissement with the bureau and there are lots of big houses with
high walls. It is hard to catch a cab at night sometimes because most
cabbies don't need to come over here since most people have their own
cars. So far as crime goes it is actually a better place since there
aren't many people around and it is easier to waylay someone in
private. Back home there would probably be alot of police around, but
there's not a whole lot of patrols around here.

So, I'm sticking to the well lighted and populated streets. I've not
really felt unsafe since my one late night wandering session. I'm
getting a better feel for the city and can't imagine there being any
problems. (Don't want anyone to worry about me.) =)

Love,
Will
