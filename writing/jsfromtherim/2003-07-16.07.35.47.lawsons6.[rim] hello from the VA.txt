Will,
  This is sort of a test mail.  I am not sure you are the only one who
sees this (and I am not in the habit of sharing my thoughts with the whole
world) and how long it takes for you to get it. I am very proud of the
your commitment and know you must be suffering horribly. I guess you are
in a reality show with too much reality. This is kind of like the way it
must have been in the old West....you're lucky if you survive but will have
one hell of a story when all is said and done. This calls for the animal
(raw instincts) need-to-survive that each person has. I wouldn't try to
think too much about what is happening and just try to get from one day to
the next. Basic needs are what you need to concentrate on now, food,
water, cover, etc. Leave the philosophy to easier days and I do think it
will get easier as you learn to deal with the situation, the environment,
the language and its barriers, and the intestinal flora. I miss you and
have faith you will find a way to make the best of this. I have to close
for the day. Let me know if you get this.
Love.
Auntie Sharon
