We had some more malaria talks yesterday. It is really pretty 
intimidating. Every 12 seconds someone dies of malaria apparently. Last 
year a PCV who was returning from an African country developed virulent 
malaria and was dead within two weeks.

The thing is that many of us will catch malaria while we are here. The 
larium does not keep us from catching it; it simply strengthens the cells 
in our liver (where the malaria parasites live) so that it does not 
spread. When we leave we will be given a regiment of drugs to kill the 
parasites that are potentially living in our livers.

This is why there are stories about people going off to Europe for 
vacation and coming down with malaria because they go off their drugs. It 
isn't that they caught it, it is that they already had it.

Matt has invited the girl that he was dating, broke up with, but is
reconsidering the decision to visit him here. We were talking about 
having people visit and whether that would be a good idea. He has 
different goals for her since she is a nurse and could work with a 
non-governmental organization (NGO) (red cross, flm, etc.) But I think 
that seeing this sort of place could be a real eye opener for anyone.

I don't think though that I would recommend it for anyone who isn't at
least at a conversational level in French. It would be interesting to see 
everything, but you would be the consummate tourist and unable to really 
get a taste of what life is like.

If anyone did decide to come and visit Mauritania though the malaria is a
big concern. Even when I go back it is a concern. I learned I won't be 
able to give blood again for several years because it can take up to three 
for malaria present in your system to become active.

The other thing that we had to do is practice our finger sticks. In the
chance there is a malaria scare and we have symptoms then we have to
prepare a slide to send to the lab. We had to do a practice slide. So we
all lined up and stabbed ourselves in the finger with a little jagged
piece of metal from the slide kit. Much fun was had by all. =) One issue
though was I choose my left hand since the injury to my non-dominant hand 
would bother me less; not thinking that I now regularly stick that hand in 
poop and so may not want there to be holes in it. Live and learn I 
suppose. =)

Love,
Will
