I shouldn't be writing now, it is nearly 100 and I am risking screwing up 
this machine that I am so fond of. I just got through though discussing 
the US a little with my brother and I was bothered and wanted to catch it.

The conversation started initially because he asked me how much my digital 
camera cost. I know the conversion rate and it would have run about 
28,500um / $100 * $140 = 39,900um, but pretty much anyone working anywhere 
could spare $100 after saving for just a bit and I think that 40,000um is 
more than most families could spare for a camera. (I could be wrong.) So, 
I said 10,000um which is the cost of a tailored set of clothes and that 
seems fair.

Later though he went off to buy ice. (I mentioned earlier that my family 
has a fridge, which they do; it is broken and stores clothes I learned.) 
When he returned he asked me how much ice is and I tried to explain that 
we don't generally buy ice because most people have refrigerators in their 
houses.

I felt bad about that because I didn't want him to think that I was 
getting down on his country. I tried to explain that America has it a 
whole lot easier because they have access to so many resources. I think 
though that I may have come across as bragging since my damned French is 
so weak.

I was thinking though about a place like Utah. If you took out all the
rivers and all the imports and just tried to have those people have a go
with the sand and the rocks I think they'd be doing well to pull off what
the Mauritanians have. You can talk about systems of government and
economic systems and whatever you want, but there is only so much that can
be done with piles of sand and lots of heat.

I certainly don't fault my country for its wealth. I am happy to have it
to return to. In part I wish that people could see things here and know
that they are damn lucky regardless of their circumstances. Matt lived on
the side of a river for a while and I admired his willingness to forgo
luxury to follow his desires. Right now that life is a good bit more
luxurious my own. I could go get in the Senegal River, but it is full of
scistocomiosis and I'd likely be pissing blood and twitching in short
order.

Anyhow, just learning a bit more about thankfulness. =)

Love,
Will
