About half of our training class is in Nouakchott right now. Many of 
them for the first time since arriving in the country. In honor of this 
there was a little get together held for them.

I've mentioned before not being an especially good drinker. I try, but I 
end up morose of contemplative as often as happy go lucky. When we went 
out dancing on Thursday a few people offered me drinks and I tried them 
but to no real effect. I had people say they'd like to see me drunk, 
since I am generally reserved. Since I've not got anything against it, 
during the party on Friday night I gave it another try.

I was pacing with Mark. The problem was I ate supper and Mark didn't. 
(Also, supper was a loaf of bread, so lots of absorption.) All told I 
did between twelve and fifteen shots depending on how you count doubles. 
Mark got pretty well toasted and all I got was a little more extroverted 
and a little less coordinated.

(I checked with sober people and they confirmed my assessment. Well, I 
had people give me a surprised "really" when I told them how much I'd 
consumed.)

I did find it easier to drink than I have in the past. Usually with 
alcohol even the smell is so overpowering I have a hard time drinking. I 
managed to drink this time without too much trouble. Shooting tequila 
and vodka still made me twitch a bit, but that's normal. =)

Another thing that factors in is sitting I think. I've started back with 
it a bit and it helps keep me grounded. You know when you are getting 
angry and you take a minute to breathe and find some calm? Well, sitting 
is like that except you do it for twenty minutes. That's a bit of an 
over simplication since it isn't always calm that you find, but getting 
connected to the part of yourself that is not affected so much by what 
is happening in your world is a part of it.

So, I've been practicing finding mental calmness. It carries over a bit 
and makes it harder for me to lose control when drinking. Or maybe it 
was just the bread, I dunno. =)

Love,
Will
