Well, I am back. I went off to see Katerie and got a better idea of where 
they are coming from. Their general position is that generally Mauritanian 
men don't move off and live by themselves unless they are too wild to 
abide living with their families. So, this house with 5 single guys is 
probably a den of ill repute. =)

I really don't think so having seen the place. The place was in too good 
of shape to have sustained regular negligence and there were too many 
breakable things sitting around. Maybe they take everything out, put 
plastic down and have wild orgies every night, but I am thinking not.

It was also a concern of Katerie's that there would be lots of people 
coming by and that everything I bought would be communal. I just moved out 
of third and denton, so I figure I can handle it. I actually calculated it 
before I left and I had more money owed to me than I actually had. I am 
kinda proud of that. I figure I'll have to do the saving thing someday so 
I can raise a family and what-not, but for now I don't want money to be 
too important to me. (Since I earn $250/month I suppose I am doing 
alright.)

I did say though that I wanted these guys to be judged on their own merits 
and not on a cultural stereotype and Katerie agreed. She sent the security 
guy out with me to talk to the fellow and things went ok. I think. Again, 
recall that most of the experiences I describe are in French which I only 
pretend to speak. =) It seemed to me though that some stuff might have 
been clarified.

The security guy, Maseri, said that he would write a report and that I
should be able to talk to Katerie tomorrow. So, I'm going to give it a
shot.

While talking to her I realized that I still really like the idea of 
living with some Mauritanians. Also, that part of what I don't like about 
my current situation is that it isn't equal. There are 4 rooms in the 
place shared by about 10 people and I have one of them. Also we are almost 
always short on water and all the time I am taking the lion's share. It 
just makes me feel very external to the family to all the time not be able 
to speak to them and also to be treated so differently. I do like them and 
I want to visit with them, but I really don't like how I feel there. It 
isn't comfortable.

If I am going to live there I don't want to be their pampered guest and I 
don't want to be their benefactor. I want to be a part of the family and I 
really don't think that we can get there.

She brought up the point of them needing money and that got to me. It made 
me feel guilty for not only taking more, but for not trying to help them 
out. Good God though, if I start getting into that guilt I can't see where 
there is an end to it here. You can strip everything I own from me and I 
still have my health and my education. I am going to have privilege over 
someone here no matter what happens. I'll die well before I match this 
place in a poverty contest. It is another place to balance.

I just want to live with a family where I feel like a normal member of the 
family. I want for it to be less luxurious than living by myself, but I'm 
looking somewhere around average. Surely we can strike this balance. It is 
just frustrating.

The other thing that Katerie said was that "it's against policy" and that 
didn't especially entertain me. She said that we could either be with a 
family or by ourselves. Since I don't know anyone other than myself who is 
living or planning to live with a family it seems like the option is to 
live by myself.

Anyhow, I still like the place, but I agreed to abide by the ruling of the 
security guy. So, I'll report in tomorrow on how that goes.

Love,
Will
