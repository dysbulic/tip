Interesting sights for the day:

Donkey carts are used frequently for either cheap transportation or
carting things across town. One particular type has old fifty gallon
drums strapped on and take water around to different places. (Some of
these fill from a well right below my house. Nice braying wake-up
call each morning. Sometimes donkeys are struck with fits of braying
for some reason.)

When donkeys are not being used to work though they are often tied to
something and hobbled by having two of their legs tied together.
Today I saw a donkey who had somehow gotten loose and was wandering
down the street. The funny part though is that its two front feet were
tied so closely together they were touching. So, it would bring its
back legs up and then hop its front legs forward a step. Watching this
hopping donkey wandering through the heavy traffic put a smile on my
face.

I think I've mentioned the toilet back in Ka√©di. It was a pit that had
sort of a roof built over it and a hole though which to deposit you
leavings. When I would come and visit I would look down in the hole
and think of the eighth circle in Dante's Hell where flatterers spend
their time wading in a sea of shit.

I have since revised my opinion of hell and have decided it is being
reborn a Mauritanian donkey. "Animal rights" is a completely foreign
concept here. Animals are useful objects, but I've not really seen any
concern though about causing them suffering. I've seen carts loaded
with 30-40 bags of cement and a fellow beating the donkey pulling it
hard enough to get its knees to buckle.

They've all pretty much got places around their backside where they're
raw from being hit. I'd say of the stuff I've seen that makes me the
saddest this is it because it is so needless. It was like seeing Omar
being hit before, it just makes me cringe. I've wondered if I will
eventually be sensitized and not be bothered when I see it. I hope
not.

*-*

The other sight for the day was some graffiti which had someone's name
an equals sign and a Star of David. I've not even got a good enough
understanding of the tensions involved to discuss that, so I'll leave
it as an exercise for the reader.

Love,
Will
