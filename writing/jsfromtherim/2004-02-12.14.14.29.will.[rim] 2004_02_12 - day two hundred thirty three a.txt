I've been working on an article for Honorable Mention, the newsletter
for the Honors program at Tech. It has been slow going, but since I
leave town tomorrow for WAIST I am calling it done. =) If you've been
here for a while it is nothing new, but if you want to read it, it is
at:

I have been running all over town getting ready to head to Dakar;
changing money, buying supplies, gifts for my host family, etc.
Inshallah, I'll make it out at 7am tomorrow. I should be incommunicado
for about a week. Hopefully when I get back I'll have some good
stories to tell.

In the interim here is an article I thought was interesting, but don't
have time to comment on right now:

Love,
Will

P.S. Many packages just arrived. There was much rejoicing.
