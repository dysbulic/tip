Ok, this is just bitching/whining, so unless you like that sort of thing 
you might skip this one.

What is really wearing on me right now is my feet. I literally have seven
significant holes in my feet and they all hurt and attract flies. I tried
wearing shoes today, and it kept the flies out, but it also mushed my toes
together and caused a couple of them to start bleeding more.

I just have to walk literally everywhere I go. I stayed home most of the 
day because I was sort of grouchy and my feet hurt, but I had to get out 
and walk to class. Not very much fun.

The two Carl's did nicknames last night and mine was "Drawl at a Crawl." 
I'm going around asking people what they consider themselves the most 
likely to have happen by the end of stage. Mine is only half jokingly 
"most likely to get gangrene."

I'm trying to get a bucket of water to soak my feet in. I think I 
communicated that to my mother. I actually walked up feeling irritated and 
started the conversation off with that. "Good evening. How are you?" 
"Fine. I want a bucket of water to put my injured feet in." I recognized 
that I was being particularly rude in a culture where greetings literally 
can last for several minutes. So, I rescinded it and said it wasn't 
important, but I am going to try again later.

And Habib told us the French schedule he wants us on. Alternating 5 and 6 
hour days. We did some 5's in the second phase and I was getting some 
serious headaches after 3 hours in a row. We are now going to do 4's. And 
Robert has lost most of his motivation. He seems to be planning to coast 
through stage knowing that they will give him an extra month and he can 
take that at the Alliance Fran√ßais in Nouakchott.

I'll admit that Habib is not all I would hope for in a teacher. In 
particular he doesn't focus on pattern at all. He just gives lots of 
examples and when I try and figure out patterns and ask them he really 
doesn't seem either to comprehend or care. He is also not very meticulous 
which I am, particularly when I am learning. He will drop in extra 
articles and then when I ask him about it he'll say "oops, you're right."

I learned today that he grew up in Atar, which is entirely white moor 
(Hassinya speaking, Arab descent. There are also black moors which are 
Hassinya speaking black people. Other black races are Pulaar, Wolof and 
Sonike (or at least those are the languages and the terms that are 
generally used.)) He didn't learn to speak French until he was in his 
20's. (I'd put him in early 30's now.)

He just thinks he understand what we are trying to say much more often 
than he actually does. So we have to figure out what he is thinking, then 
figure out how to convince him that we mean something else. Robert seems 
to be pretty much past putting in the effort. I am going to keep at it. I 
really expect these days to wear on me though.

On a good note though, Mark Lange's mom made these really neat tye-dyed 
boubou's where she transfered the PC logo over and I may be getting one. 
The fabrics here are amazing. The women literally spend hours and hours 
tying hundreds of knots of string around the cloth and then doing the 
dying. One trainee who went to a cooperative said she was told that it can 
literally take weeks to produce an intricate piece. I definitely want to 
get some before I go.

Love, (and venting)
Will

P.S. The Internet is broken too. =(
