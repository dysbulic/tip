Just a quick "not-dead" note. I am in fact (not dead that is). I have been
working furiously trying to get a set of computers up and running for one of
our solar powered computer labs. The requirements of supporting three
different language groups which are mutually exclusive are very taxing.

These computers are going into a Hassiniya speaking village, so the
volunteers who will be working with them speak Hassiniya and no French.
Unfortunately very few volunteers can read Arabic, so they need to be able
to work in English. Since there are also some Francophones in the village it
needs to handle French as well. Windows XP has some very nice support for
multiple languages, but it is characteristically unstable and tempremental.

I am headed home now to pack and at 5am (in 3 hours) I'm due at the airport
to fly to Bamako. Yippie!

Just wanted to check in since I may not be here for another week and a half
depending on Mali.

Love,
Will
