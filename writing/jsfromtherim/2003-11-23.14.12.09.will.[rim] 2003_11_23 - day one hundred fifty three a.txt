I used to be pretty good at the whole introspection personal development 
growth enlightenment sort of thing. I feel like I've lost my edge in the 
last couple years. Went off into town to try and become a businessman, 
in so much as programming is my business. Unfortunately I couldn't fast, 
wasn't especially good at waiting and my thinking seemed to bring more 
problems than it solved.

I think part of the reason that I've been sort of leveling off is my 
drive is gone. When I got to college I was a pretty sad kid. I didn't 
like myself and didn't see any good reason for other people to like me. 
The thought of just being happy once in a while was enough of a carrot 
to get me moving. And besides it at least made me feel like I was doing 
something which makes shitty circumstances more bearable in general.

Now, I've lost alot of that fuel. I'm not necessarily actively happy all 
the time, but I'm generally content. I could certainly live like this 
for the rest of my life and other than it being a bit boring I'd say it 
wasn't a bad run.

When I was in Huntsville. (Fowler talks about creating the myth of our 
lives. Huntsville, if you haven't noticed, is a particularly mythic bit 
for me.) Anyhow, I did the whole meditation and seeking challenging 
experiences and growth bit in Huntsville and after a bit I started to 
really like the way things were going. Not just the sort of defacto not 
disliking that I've got going on now, but to really be entertained by 
pretty much everything that was going on. (I ended it by nearly working 
myself to death and fighting with Steph alot, but that's a different myth.)

Since I am here though and have newfound copious spare time, I figured 
maybe I'd start easing back into some of the patterns that I was holding 
then. Just little stuff like waiting until I'm really hungry to eat and 
exercising regularly. Little stuff to pay attention since paying close 
attention to the experience of life seems to make it better for some 
reason. I guess it just keeps me from glossing over so many of the details.

So Jay had some random growth oriented book and I borrowed it. Not 
really looking for any deep insights, but just wanting to sort of have 
something to focus me on that sort of work. The title is The Four 
Agreements and I agree with Jay's characterization of "nothing really 
new, but not a bad summary of good stuff to remember."

One bit I did like is that he uses the metaphor that we are dreaming. 
That's common enough, but rather than taking about "waking up" he talks 
about changing the dream. I liked the expression of the idea that we 
can't stop playing the game. We can see it and we can choose to respond 
to it in different ways, but there are certain aspects of living life 
that we can't change.

The book reminds me a big of Casteneda, but without the supernatural 
bit. I suppose that's alright. I always liked to dream of having magic 
powers when I'd read Casteneda. It is probably best that I don't have 
magic powers.

There is a rooster who lives somewhere near my house. On TV you see the 
rooster waking up and giving a hearty cock-a-doodle-doo "Good Morning 
Mr. Sun" to the sun crests the horizon. Real roosters aren't like that. 
They start calling to Mr. Sun a good hour before he arrives and continue 
for a good hour after he is shining brightly. They manage somehow to 
keep the same fervor the entire time.

I say that it is good that I don't have magic powers because I'm pretty 
sure that one of the first things I'd do with them is reach out and 
choke the life out of that rooster.

Ok, that's it for me. The rooster joke is all I had really. It took me 
an hour (between 4:30 and 5:30a.m.) to come up with that. I am off to 
find some falafel. The French Cultural Center is showing Bowling for 
Columbine. Maybe it'll be in English so I'll understand some if it.

Go enjoy the autumn. Play in the laves for me. Palm trees don't loose 
their leaves unfortunately.

Love,
Will
