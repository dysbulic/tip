Will,

   Saturday I put in the mail 2 separate packages to test the delivery
time. One was heavy almost 3 lbs filled with candy, the other a single cd,
Garth Brooks, "Scarecrow". Iim trying to track the delivery time of the
packages in order to get a handle on the mail service. I am wondering if
size and weight will make a difference. I found out any package under 4
lbs can be sent letter post rate which must be cheaper than parcel post
rate. She didn't go in to detail.  Also, today is week 3 for the first
package that was mailed. I am anxious to know if you get everything. I am
a visual person and have images of mail carriers leading donkeys with
packages and letters in burlap sacks on their backs to little villages in
the middle of no-man's land. I am an old west fan, you know.

   Yesterday your grandmother and I spent some time in the French
section of Barnes and Noble trying to find the miracle you have been
searching for. I believe she found you some books and tapes for younger
children and I concentrated on the texts for adults. I found a book your
mother said you had in high school, phrases you never learned in your high
school French class, along with a workbook and a Stephen King book, "RAGE".
I expect these to have heavliy worn jackets by our visit next year.

   As always, my thoughts and prayers are with you. Let us know how you
are doing, both mentally and physically. I loved the story of the semi
racing down the mountain hell-bent for disaster. However, I doubt if you
left small children trama-sticken, or did you?

Much love,
Auntie Sharon
