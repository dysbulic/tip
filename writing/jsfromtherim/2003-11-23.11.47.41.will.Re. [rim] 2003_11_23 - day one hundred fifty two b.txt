I am going to answer this publicly since I think it is an interesting
question...

The way it works is Friday is the holy day, Saturday is the relaxation
day and then the work week starts on Sunday. They have the French
influence though and many people do the month long vacation during
August. They go "en brusse" out to the desert somewhere and hang out in
a tent drinking tea. And there's Ramadan of course and one can only do 
so much work when you've not eaten all day...

Have you ever seen the movie Office Space? "I'd say in a given week I
probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work." There is
actual work done here, but the pace is certainly more relaxed.

> How many hours a week do most people work?

It varies widely of course. A boutique owner is usually in his boutique
pretty much all day. A guardian for a house seems to generally be
divided between a daytime guy and a nighttime guy. At the university
people seem to show up around 9a.m. and leave around 4p.m. I figure most
people are running around 35-40 hours a week.

> What is your work week like?

Currently nonexistent. I get up around 9 and come to the university
around 10. I fix computers here or occupy myself with whatever the
project is for the day. I usually wander off anytime between 3-8p.m.

We should be doing our instructor training (8 hours a day for 10 days 
straight) in December. (Have I mentioned that it doesn't rain, but it 
pours here?)

I'm not sure exactly how our teaching schedule will work since the
university is theoretically starting today. They told us to not expect
students to come by before next week though. This Tuesday is the end of
Ramadan which will be a big party. Then people need a day to recuperate
and after that it is already Thursday, so why work just one day?

I'll also hopefully be helping them set up a server to do some computer
networking stuff. They are getting the labs set up now and will probably
be needing me in about a week. (Once my class has started of course.) =)

No, the only time it goes to the whole list is when you send it to
jsfromtherim. Just replying should send it to only me unless you choose
to "respond to all recipients." When in doubt, just check who it is
going to and make sure jsfromtherim isn't there.
