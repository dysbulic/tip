The day before yesterday we went to one part of the IT ministry and met 
the national webdesigners and the fellow responsible for making the 
national IT plan actually happen. It was interesting to see everything, but 
we didn't really learn a whole lot that we didn't already know.

Afterward though, we went over to the bureau (the PC bureau) and Sharif 
was there and showed us his apartment. It was pretty nice by my standards. 
It had a bedroom, a living room, a bathroom and a closet that passed for a 
kitchen. The bathroom though had a shower in it and a European toilet. You 
still wash your butt with your hands, but when you're suffering with 
diarrhea you can sit down at least.

He said that he pays 28,000um + electricity, but that it was also an
unheard of good deal. Apparently the PC stipend is 81,000um for volunteers 
living in Nouakchott because the cost of living is so high. Obie said to 
expect to pay around 40,000 a month.

Another interesting story Sharif told while we were visiting was that he 
was run over by a car about a month ago. Apparently he went to the beach 
with some friends and during the night some of the cars moved around. In 
the morning one of his friends started to leave and backed his land rover 
onto Sharif's chest. Everyone started screaming, so he stopped the car and 
got out (with the car still parked on Sharif.) He ended up having to drive 
the car off Sharif, but did it the wrong direction and ran over him a 
second time.

Honestly the guy looked really good to have been run over twice so 
recently. I wouldn't have though anything at all was wrong with him. He 
said that he still has some back pain, but that generally he is doing 
well.

On the subject of cars imagine what driving would be like if you took away 
all the stop signs and lights and then about 80% of the pavement and 
allowed people to pass on either side of the road. As best I can tell 
there are basically no appreciable traffic laws here. At best I think 
there are some loosely recognized suggestions. Definitely the borders of 
the road are much less sacrosanct; you drive wherever you want so long as 
whatever is there currently can be convinced to get out of the way.

We aren't allowed to operate anything motorized and honestly I'm surprised 
that we ever were. I suppose that for volunteers way out in villages a 
moped could be useful, but here in the city you'd have to be suicidal to 
get behind the wheel of a car. The one advantage to it is that the 
combination of chaos and unpaved roads generally slows most traffic to 
about 30mph, so most of the accidents are probably not serious. (As 
evidenced by the ubiquity of dinged bumpers.)

Love,
Will
