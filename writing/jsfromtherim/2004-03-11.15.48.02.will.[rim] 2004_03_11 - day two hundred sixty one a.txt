Imagine a smoky room with the lights down low. On a low stage a single
spotlight picks me out sitting in a simple wooden chair by an equally
simple table. My only companion is a glass of water that I drink from
as I occasionally as I address the crowd in an even tone.

That was the picture playing through my head most of the time as I've
been addressing you for the last few months. I'm no circus with
booming voices and dancing monkeys, but I am a performer
nonetheless. I am here to regale you with a bit of tale and hopefully
let you see it through eyes that makes it all interesting.

Of the people who I might have hoped to emulate here Spalding Gray
comes to mind. If you ask me, the crown duke of the monologue, subject
only to the bard. I suppose much of that admiration is as a
pathologically dark person exploring their own darkness. He's dead now
though having finally succeeded in his repeated attempts to end his own
life.

The problem that I am facing tonight is that I have nothing
entertaining to say. To all inward appearances I am stuck. Stuck on
fearing death and wanting love. Stuck in this same place you've seen
me in for the last month and in all honesty I've been wallowing in for
the last ten years at least.

I fear though what I will hear if I stop talking and but listen to the
audience. Not the rustle of chairs as people shift uneasily and
prepare to leave. I fear hearing nothing. I fear that out beyond the
glare of the spotlight the place is empty. If I but stop and turn my
attention outward will I begin to feel the void surrounding me? Best
to push such unpleasantness from my mind. Look up for a moment into the
spotlight till I can't see anything else. Grimacing as a bit of pain
flickers though my head I focus on my job again...

I'd like to recommend a bit of reading in the face of my inability to
produce nothing more than this morbid bit of exhibitionism. Jay,
another volunteer with me in Nouakchott, has also been writing for the
last few months. His style is more polished and less self-involved
than my own. You can find him at:

Come check back on me in a week or two and hopefully I'll be cheeky
and cheerful. It does happen occasionally.

Ok, that aside, ::sips water::, I've got more of this death and love
stuff that is currently filling my head and those of you who've chosen
to hang around are going to get to see if I can pull it out.

Love,
Will

P.S. For those, like my dearest Auntie Sharon, who fear for my mental
health and happiness, you needn't. Well, at the least you needn't fear
for anything serious. Just think of me as one of those painter types
living in a grand studio who are occasionally touched by fits of
creativity marked by brooding and mood swings. I'm like that other
than the lack of creativity and ability to paint and the
studio... Well, pretty much all of it other than the mood swings.

I write to work things out. This doesn't mean that there is a problem,
this means that the problem is being dealt with. Why do it as publicly
as all this? I think it is the whole love/seeking connection
thing. But, I'm getting ahead of myself...
