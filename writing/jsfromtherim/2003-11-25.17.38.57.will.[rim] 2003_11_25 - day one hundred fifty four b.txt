I don't know how much publicity this got back home, but the Dayton
Daily News did a series called "Casualties of Peace" that painted the
Peace Cops in a fairly negative light.

It particularly focuses on the issues of safety and security. At this
point I am pretty much without comment. I can say that I feel safe
here, but I am a male in a relatively calm country.

We went to see Bowling for Columbine the other night and I thought
that Moore's characterization of our society as one in fear was an
interesting one. I didn't feel especially nervous back home, but that
there certainly were enough reasons to do so.

Here is pretty much the same. We have had robberies and the State
Department just released another general world wide warning for the
end of Ramadan. "Watch out, wherever you are, it isn't safe." I
suppose that if I wanted to worry I could find reason. All in all
though it doesn't seem like it would do a whole lot other than make
life less fun.

Anyhow, I said I wasn't going to comment.

Love,
Will
