Wow, what a hell of a day. I have been in a plane for over 13 and a half 
hours now. I would start and stop my watch each time we would take off. 
Unfortunately Delta overbooked the flight to Paris and so another PC group 
to Gabon, which had a longer layover, had to give up some of their seats 
so that we could make our flight and the ensuing luggage debacle took two 
hours and ate our whole Paris layover.

So, I have some rushed shots of running through the Paris airport trying 
to make our flight. Interestingly the last flight of the Concord was going 
out as we were sitting in line and so I got to watch it take off. There 
was a bunch of cars with lights flashing that followed it out.

The Paris flight was pretty rough. All 6'3" of me could not sleep at all 
well in the 20" of seat space I was allotted. I ended up half flopped over 
onto the girl sitting beside me and still didn't actually do more than 
doze.

Speaking of people:

I rode on the plane next to Cat. She is a poly-sci major who is hoping to 
use her PC experience to help her work with the State Department. She was 
entertaining to talk to though eventually the conversation devolved to an 
argument between Stephanie (who was sitting on the other side of Cat) and 
I about the reality of gender stereotypes. Cat is a SED volunteer.

Behind me was Julia who I mentioned before. She was wading through the 900 
page children's book that is the new Harry Potter.

The plane ride on Air France was very fancy. I don't especially enjoy 
wine, but they were handing out beer, champagne and wine, so I drank about 
a half a bottle of reasonably nice red. The dinner was very nice too. 
Calamari with steamed vegetables in olive oil. Then veal in mushroom sauce 
with rice. There was even a mini-baguette. Also, the plane had a little tv 
behind every seat and you could play video games or listen to music or 
watch movies. I watched About Schmitt and Catch Me If You Can.

We flew over desert for a very long time. It is really amazing when the 
expanse is sand is so great that it covers everything; even from 35,000'. 
There were two colors: tan on the bottom and blue on the top with a little 
bit of white fluff in the middle.

Mauritania is very poor. I mean, I knew that, but it is really poor. We
are in the upscale part of town and the shape of the buildings is like in
the inner city. They are more widely spread out than the inner city
though. All the streets but one are sand. There are lots of goats and
kids just milling in the streets. It isn't like there is a sort of normal
city and then really poor parts toward the outside. It starts out as 
rough and goes to mud huts and tents.

We got some more shots and met for a while. I am getting tired of writing, 
so I will return to that later.

Love,
Will
