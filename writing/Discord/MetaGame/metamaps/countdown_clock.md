I like the idea of going up and down layers and switching to a different map.
I am fascinated by the 13-sign scientifically accurate zodiac. I would like to move our holiday schedule to it, but have production on the Hijri running two week sprints.

The Hijri is the Islamic lunar calendar. Unlike the Chinese, they don't insert months to keep track with the sun.

It just trudges on 12 months at a time.

It is some set of pieces of software that are the evolution of however a more equitable world comes into being.

I get a real sense of belief here that we're getting close with the rise of ERC tokens and the ability to realign wealth distribution.

On the 13-sign calendar, the beginning of Capricorn coincides with the Inauguration.

This clock: https://z13cdn.web.app/ is counting down to 0/:capricorn:/0 when Biden will be sworn.

Negative dates reverse the direction of counting. The Military gets a new Commander in a week, so it is -0/:sagittarius:/7.

The only way I won't change 0 to 2025 (making this -3/:sagittarius:/7) is if Biden ceases all bombing his first day on the job. 

It is well within the real of what he is permitted to do, but it's not realistic for some perverse reason.

I like how you are arranging your y-axis there :heart: and the Z date moves so fast, but the rest moving slowly is pretty hypnotic :heart:

I want to define a set of events like:
• the end of war
• the end of hunger
• the end of homelessness
• the last bomb dropped by the US

Then lay them out aligned with the countdown clock. The end of war hinges on us being able to convince the world that a true revolution has taken place and whatever grievances they have it is with our predecessors.

This is why the beginning of Capricorn (the Inauguration) is the 0th year, the revolution takes place using the democratic process.

Biden could be the start of it, but to do so he'd have to do something decisive: end bombing. It's -0/:sagittarius:/6, tomorrow is -0/:sagittarius:/5, up until the Inauguration: 0/:capricorn:/0 which is followed by 0/:capricorn:/1 and things progress as expected.

Biden ending bombing exists within the narrative of the revolution, The Technoanarchist Revolution, taking off and the idea going viral.

Within that context the date really would mark a pivot because if Biden ended bombing at our behest we could likely do our fundraising unmolested.

I want to take the violence and adulterating out of the black market. A customer shops online, is able to see lab results for the substance they are purchasing, and receive a hygienically packaged product.

How this is implemented varies widely depending on the political climate.

That is access to a market of literally billions. 

With those funds we buy living spaces and lease them through an equitable system such that everyone has access to a place to stay.

We also aid UBI efforts to combat hunger.

Yeh, I'ma not comment on fictional figures like politicians here... :heart:

Ending bombing is a stretch, I know, which is why I don't think Jan. 20th will be where the exponential curves driving much of this really start to take off.

The plan then is to figure out a candidate for the next race.

The most fundamental way I want to change the office is to livestream the bulk of it and enable the populace at large to participate in the conversation.
