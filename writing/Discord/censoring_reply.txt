It's just sucking the fun out of it. I had one argument I almost never deliver (& I've got one on the n word I've done with 8â€’10 black people) b/c of how incendiary it is, & it was ill received.

I believed that there could be a separate adult space where open discussion and radical expression could take place. That was incorrect.

I've got not vendetta @heterotic, I'm working on and through some ideas. I express them as best I can and revise. The OP was not from the most balanced of places precisely because of the extreme societal pressure not to examine it. I have no desire to flip people out.

I'm just tired and disappointed is all. I think that denying me an hour to get my affairs in order after I listen to a half dozen people discuss my moral decrepitude for an hour was unjust.

I don't know who of you can see that it is better to take extreme actions from a balanced place, but you rushed to judgement.
