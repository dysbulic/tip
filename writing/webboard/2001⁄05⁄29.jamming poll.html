<p>I read an article today on <a
href="http://www.slashdot.org">/.</a> by John Katz about the <a href="http://slashdot.org/features/01/05/24/160210.shtml">fastfood as a preview for the potentials of technology</a>. In the comments below the article I ran across a site I remembered from a while back called <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/">adbusters</a> that did some <a href="http://adbusters.org/spoofads">spoof ads</a> I saw on <a href="http://www.attrition.org/gallery">attrition</a>. The Obsession ads are good, the <a href="http://adbusters.org/spoofads/fashion/obsession-m/">men's ad</a> was cute and the <a href="http://adbusters.org/spoofads/fashion/obsession-w/">women's ad</a> was disturbing.</p>
<p>Anyhow, enough of my weblog. <img src="http://www.himinbi.org/images/small_smiley.png" alt="=)" /> From adbusters <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/creativeresistance/jamgallery/street/">"jamming" section</a> I got a a site called <a href="http://www.changingtheclimate.com/">www.changingtheclimate.com</a> and it is a bunch of people who go around sticking bumper stickers that say "I'm changing the climate, ask me how" on SUV's.</p>
<p>My poll is on people's thoughts on such a practice. They have guidelines like, only put them on metal bumpers and not on paint and if you put them in a window put them at the bottom so it doesn't obstruct the drivers visibility. Stuff to make it so that they are only causing an inconvenience and not any serious damage or danger.</p>
<p>Me personally, I don't think that I will do it but I largely respect and sympathize with those who do. I think the strongest argument against it is that it is a direct breach of another person's personal space and private property, but I think that actions taken without awareness or concern for the rest of society breach upon other's rights it is just not so obvious.</p>
