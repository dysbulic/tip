1
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,568
I had ambitions to set out and find...

2
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,900
like an odyssey of going home somewhere.

3
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:44,739
I set out to find this home
that I'd left a while back...

4
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:49,074
and I couldn't remember exactly
where it was, but I was on my way there.

5
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,319
And encountering what I encountered
on the way, was how I envisioned it all.

6
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,855
I didn't really have any ambition at all.

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,753
I was born very far
from where I'm supposed to be...

8
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,793
and so I'm on my way home, you know.

9
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,039
<i>Once upon a time you dressed so fine</i>

10
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,475
<i>You threw the bums a dime in your prime</i>

11
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,216
<i>Didn't you?</i>

12
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:29,546
<i>People call and say,</i>
<i>"Beware, doll, you're bound to fall"</i>

13
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:34,252
<i>You thought they were all kidding you</i>

14
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,201
<i>You used to laugh about</i>

15
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,403
<i>Everybody that was hanging out</i>

16
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,771
<i>Now you don't talk too loud</i>

17
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:58,578
<i>Now you don't seem so proud</i>

18
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,145
<i>About having to be scrounging around</i>

19
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:06,453
<i>For your next meal</i>

20
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,757
<i>How does it feel</i>

21
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,161
<i>How does it feel</i>

22
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,736
<i>To be on your own</i>

23
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,443
<i>With no direction home</i>

24
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:34,052
<i>Like a complete unknown</i>

25
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,388
<i>Like a rolling stone?</i>

26
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,910
<i>Time... You can do a lot of things</i>
<i>that seem to make time stand still...</i>

27
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,508
<i>but of course, you know,</i>
<i>no one can do that.</i>

28
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,965
<i>Maybe when I was about 10,</i>
<i>I started playing the guitar.</i>

29
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,005
<i>I found a guitar in the house</i>
<i>that my father bought, actually.</i>

30
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,940
<i>I found something else in there.</i>
<i>This kind of mystical overtones.</i>

31
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,036
<i>There was a great big mahogany radio.</i>

32
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,581
<i>It had a 78 turntable</i>
<i>when you opened up the top.</i>

33
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,017
<i>And I opened it up one day...</i>

34
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,781
<i>and there was a record on,</i>
<i>a country record...</i>

35
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,483
<i>this song called</i>
Drifting Too Far From Shore.

36
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,125
The sound of the record made me feel
like I was somebody else...

37
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,230
and that...

38
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,569
you know, I was maybe not even
born to the right parents, or something.

39
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,390
<i>It looked like any other town</i>
<i>out of the '40s or '50s.</i>

40
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,191
<i>Just some rural town.</i>
<i>It was on the way to nowhere.</i>

41
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,198
<i>And you probably couldn't find it on a map.</i>

42
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,841
<i>Maybe three blocks one way,</i>
<i>and maybe three blocks the other way...</i>

43
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,072
<i>and that was like a main street</i>
<i>where all the department stores were...</i>

44
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,741
<i>the drugstores, the...</i>
<i>That's about it, you know.</i>

45
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,223
<i>What happens to a town</i>
<i>after the livelihood is gone?</i>

46
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,123
<i>All right, it just sort of decays</i>
<i>and blows away, doesn't it?</i>

47
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,093
<i>That's the way it goes.</i>

48
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,328
<i>Most of the land was either farmland...</i>

49
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,698
<i>or just completely scavenged</i>
<i>by the mining companies.</i>

50
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,862
<i>Very hot in the summertime...</i>

51
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,440
in the winter,
it was just rightly cold, you know.

52
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,805
All winter, it was just, I mean...

53
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,276
We didn't have the clothes they have now...

54
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,745
so I mean, you just wore
two or three shirts at a time.

55
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:16,837
Slept in your clothes.

56
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:23,578
<i>The pit was on the outer limits of the town.</i>
<i>That's where everybody worked.</i>

57
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,648
<i>You couldn't be a rebel.</i>
<i>It was so cold that you couldn't be bad.</i>

58
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,354
<i>The weather equalizes everything</i>
<i>very quickly.</i>

59
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,954
<i>And nobody was gonna really pull a stickup.</i>

60
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,126
There really wasn't any philosophy,
any idiom...

61
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,461
any ideology to really go against.

62
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,210
<i>My father and his brothers,</i>
<i>they had an electrical store.</i>

63
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,906
<i>'Bout the first job I ever had</i>
<i>was sweeping up the store...</i>

64
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,006
and I was supposed to learn...

65
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,551
the discipline of hard work or something,
you know...

66
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,884
and the merits of employment.

67
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,129
<i>Circuses came through.</i>

68
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,168
<i>There were tent shows</i>
<i>at the carny midways.</i>

69
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,566
<i>And they had barkers.</i>

70
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,263
Got a horse with two heads!

71
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,967
Got a chicken in there with a man's face!

72
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,906
Come see the girl-boy!

73
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,874
<i>It was just more rural back then.</i>

74
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,471
<i>That's what people did.</i>
<i>You could see guys in blackface.</i>;

75
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,250
George Washington in blackface...

76
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,384
or Napoleon wearing blackface.

77
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,754
Like, weird Shakespearean things.

78
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,123
Stuff that didn't really make any sense
at the time.

79
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,325
<i>And people had other jobs</i>
<i>in the carny team.</i>

80
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,058
<i>I saw somebody putting makeup on...</i>

81
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,532
<i>getting back from running</i>
<i>the Ferris wheel once.</i>

82
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,466
And I thought that was pretty interesting.

83
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,301
Guy's got, you know... He does two things,
you know, or something like that.

84
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:53,107
<i>I've got a song here that I'd like to do</i>
<i>that's been awful kind to me and the boys.</i>

85
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,338
<i>It's a tune called.</i>;

86
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,813
Cold Cold Heart.

87
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,030
<i>We'd have to listen late at night</i>
<i>for other stations to come in...</i>

88
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,692
<i>from other parts of the country,</i>
<i>places that were far away.</i>

89
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,237
<i>Fifty-thousand watt stations</i>
<i>coming out through the atmosphere.</i>

90
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,569
<i>Johnnie Ray.</i>;

91
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,135
<i>He had some kind of strange incantation</i>
<i>in his voice...</i>

92
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,874
<i>like he'd been voodooed...</i>

93
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,610
and he cried, kind of, when he sang.

94
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,488
<i>It's Grand Ole Opry time.</i>

95
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,932
<i>Another big folk music show,</i>
<i>starring Webb Pierce.</i>

96
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,038
<i>It was the sound that got to me.</i>

97
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,908
It wasn't who it was, or...

98
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,012
It was the sound of it.

99
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:14,213
<i>This is our town, Hibbing, Minnesota, USA.</i>

100
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,551
<i>I began listening to the radio,</i>
<i>I began to get bored being there.</i>

101
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,615
I thought about going to military school...

102
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,389
but the military school
that I envisioned myself going to...

103
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,091
I couldn't get in...

104
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,461
which was West Point.

105
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,599
You know, I could always envision myself
dying in some heroic battle somewhere.

106
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,004
So I mean, maybe that era...

107
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,943
has gone.

108
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,809
<i>First time I heard rock 'n' roll</i>
<i>on the radio...</i>

109
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,856
<i>I felt it was pretty similar to the</i>
<i>country music which I'd been listening to.</i>

110
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,823
I formed a couple of groups, growing up,
and we rehearsed and played...

111
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,261
where we could play.
There wasn't much opportunity...

112
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,159
to really break out of that area.

113
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,565
<i>Robert was in my class, and that was</i>
<i>the era that they had the talent show.</i>

114
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,002
<i>Robert, of course, he was up on stage.</i>

115
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,710
<i>His concert began,</i>
<i>and it was quite surprising.</i>

116
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,213
<i>I saw Robert stand there at the piano...</i>

117
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,117
<i>and my guess is</i>
<i>that he was trying to destroy it.</i>

118
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:00,591
<i>He was pumping on the thing.</i>
<i>It was a most unusual thing to observe.</i>

119
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,394
<i>The principal pulled the curtain on him.</i>

120
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,455
<i>He said to me, "I didn't think</i>
<i>that music was suitable for the audience...</i>

121
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,090
<i>"so I pulled the curtain."</i>

122
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,369
Nobody liked country music,
or rock 'n' roll, or rhythm and blues.

123
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,135
<i>That kind of music wasn't</i>
<i>what was happening up there.</i>

124
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,984
<i>The music that was popular was</i>
How Much is that Doggie in the Window?

125
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,782
<i>That wasn't our reality.</i>
<i>Our reality was bleak to begin with.</i>

126
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,756
<i>Our reality was fear that at any moment...</i>

127
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,692
<i>this black cloud would explode,</i>
<i>where everybody would be dead.</i>

128
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:42,934
<i>They would show you in school,</i>
<i>how to dive for cover under your desk.</i>

129
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,165
<i>We grew up with all that,</i>
<i>so it created a sense of paranoia...</i>

130
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,365
that, I don't know, was probably unforeseen.

131
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,850
<i>In May, 1959,</i>
<i>I recorded a tape for Bob Zimmerman.</i>

132
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,251
Bob was real excited to learn
I had a tape recorder...

133
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,125
and he wanted to know
what he sounded like.

134
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,824
<i>I really can't say</i>
<i>if the girls took a liking to me or not...</i>

135
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>from playing around town.</i>

136
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,867
<i>The first girl that ever took a liking to me,</i>
<i>her name was Gloria Story.</i>

137
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,496
<i>Gloria Story, I mean,</i>
<i>that was her real name.</i>

138
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,838
<i>Second girlfriend was named Echo.</i>
<i>Now, that's pretty strange.</i>

139
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,037
<i>I've never met anybody named Echo.</i>

140
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,843
<i>I serenaded her underneath the ladder</i>
<i>that went up to her window.</i>

141
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,720
And both these girls, by the way,
brought out the poet in me.

142
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,155
<i>Long after we have gone...</i>

143
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,890
<i>while the flesh of our beginning has not yet</i>
<i>traveled the light years into distance...</i>

144
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,524
<i>it will disappear into the blackness</i>
<i>of the space from which we came...</i>

145
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:54,834
<i>destroyed as we began,</i>
<i>in a burst of gas and fire.</i>

146
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,441
<i>James Dean, Brando,</i> The Wild One.

147
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,709
It didn't kill all the entire past.

148
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,014
It's not like they just appeared
and there's a new scene happening now.

149
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,521
Time, you know, time kind of
obliterated the past...

150
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,388
that was around when I was growing up.

151
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,421
Just time and progress, really.

152
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,958
<i>How does it feel</i>

153
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:26,027
<i>Oh, how does it feel</i>

154
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,975
<i>To be on your own</i>

155
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:37,047
<i>With no direction home</i>

156
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,520
<i>Like a complete unknown</i>

157
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,723
<i>Like a rolling stone?</i>

158
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,483
He's just changed altogether.

159
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,958
He's changed from what he was.
He's not the same as what he was at first.

160
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,256
- You don't even recognize him.
- No.

161
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,492
About a year ago,
I saw him here in Sheffield at the City Hall...

162
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,329
and I thought he was magnificent.

163
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,869
You know, I thought
he just couldn't improve if he tried.

164
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,495
Then the next thing that happened was...

165
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,767
he went really commercial,
with this backing group.

166
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,241
And I didn't like that very much.

167
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,135
I don't know what he's trying to do.

168
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,613
I think he's conceding, you know,
to some sort of popular taste.

169
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,049
I think it's a bad thing.
I think he's prostituting himself.

170
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:31,558
I don't think the spirit of the Dylan songs
has been portrayed with this...

171
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,127
with this incredibly corny group behind him.

172
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:41,169
I like his earlier records
as on his <i>Freewheelin'</i> LPs, etcetera...

173
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,434
but this, I just can't stick.

174
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,112
I found it rather boring.

175
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,876
I found there was too much improvising
on his wretched harmonica.

176
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:56,853
And he tended to lose the rhythm
on his guitar altogether at times.

177
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,289
<i>Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man,</i>
<i>play a song for me</i>

178
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,521
<i>Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man,</i>
<i>play a song for me</i>

179
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,893
<i>I'm not sleepy</i>
<i>and there is no place I'm going to</i>

180
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:13,331
<i>Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man,</i>
<i>play a song for me</i>

181
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:18,239
<i>In the jingle jangle morning</i>
<i>I'll come following you</i>

182
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,573
<i>Though I know that evening's empire</i>

183
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,084
<i>Has returned into sand</i>

184
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,346
<i>Vanished from my hand</i>

185
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:35,052
<i>Left me blindly here to stand</i>
<i>but still not sleeping</i>

186
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:42,529
<i>My weariness amazes me</i>
<i>I'm branded on my feet</i>

187
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,827
<i>I have no one to meet</i>

188
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,896
<i>And the ancient empty street's</i>
<i>too dead for dreaming</i>

189
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,771
<i>Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man,</i>
<i>play a song for me</i>

190
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:01,614
<i>I'm not sleepy</i>
<i>and there is no place I'm going to</i>

191
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:08,760
<i>Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man,</i>
<i>play a song for me</i>

192
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:13,491
<i>In the jingle jangle morning</i>
<i>I'll come following you</i>

193
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,712
<i>Got out of high school</i>
<i>and left the very next day.</i>

194
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,306
<i>I'd gone as far as I could</i>
<i>in my particular environment.</i>

195
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,813
I was gonna try to join some other band.

196
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,204
<i>There was only one guy that ever</i>
<i>came out of there, and he was out of Fargo.</i>

197
00:17:56,308 --> 00:18:00,540
<i>And I'd actually gone there to play with him.</i>
<i>He had a regional hit called</i> Suzie Baby.

198
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,376
<i>At that point,</i>
<i>I was just playing triplets on the piano.</i>

199
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,475
I didn't have my own piano,
so they weren't gonna buy a piano.

200
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,346
But I did play some shows with them.

201
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,050
Nothing much came of it.

202
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:20,758
<i>He would let people know</i>
<i>that he was maybe Bobby Vee.</i>

203
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,530
<i>Bob told everyone including his, like,</i>
<i>cousins and relatives...</i>

204
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,695
that, you know, he was Bobby Vee.

205
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,468
And I guess he liked that recognition
of being famous.

206
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,975
'Cause people looked at him, and say:

207
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,511
"Hey, that's a pretty good song
you got out, Bobby Vee."

208
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,979
I was a musical expeditionary.

209
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,545
I had no past, really, to speak of,
nothing to go back to, nobody to lean on.

210
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:45,180
<i>I came down to Minneapolis.</i>
<i>I didn't go to classes.</i>

211
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,948
I was enrolled...

212
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,923
but I didn't go to classes.

213
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,392
I just didn't feel like it.

214
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:00,796
<i>We were singing and playing all night.</i>
<i>Sleeping most of, you know, the morning.</i>

215
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,272
<i>I didn't really have any time for studying.</i>

216
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,439
<i>"Praised be man</i>

217
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,671
<i>"He is existing in milk, and living in lilies</i>

218
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,050
<i>"And his violin music</i>
<i>takes place in milk and creamy emptiness</i>

219
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,583
<i>"Praised be the unfolded inside petal</i>
<i>flesh of tend'rest thought</i>

220
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,026
<i>"Praised be delusion; the ripple</i>

221
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,560
<i>"Praised be the Holy Ocean of Eternity</i>

222
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:28,824
<i>"Praised be I, writing,</i>
<i>dead already, and dead again"</i>

223
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,864
<i>I fell into that atmosphere</i>
<i>of everything Kerouac was saying...</i>

224
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,099
<i>about the world being completely mad.</i>

225
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,905
And the only people for him
that were interesting...

226
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,275
were the mad people, the mad ones,
the ones who were, you know, mad to live...

227
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:51,382
and mad to talk, mad to be saved,
desirous of everything at the same time...

228
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,248
the ones who never yawn,
all those mad ones.

229
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,725
And I felt like I fit right into that bunch.

230
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,149
<i>I had heard folk music</i>
<i>before leaving the Iron Range.</i>

231
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,781
<i>I'd heard John Jacob Niles somewhere,</i>
<i>strangely enough.</i>

232
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,951
I don't know, folk music
was delivering me something, you know...

233
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,530
which was the way I always felt about life,
you know, and people...

234
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:14,604
and, you know, institutions, and ideology...

235
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,238
and it was just,
you know, uncovering it all.

236
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,774
<i>She played that upstroke-downstroke</i>
<i>kind of rhythm...</i>

237
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,543
<i>where you don't need the drum.</i>
<i>It's kind of like a Tex-Mex rhythm.</i>

238
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,015
I heard that rhythm...

239
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,452
and I thought, well, I could use
that rhythm for all kinds of things.

240
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,885
<i>I don't even remember, you know,</i>
<i>buying any records.</i>

241
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:44,655
<i>If went into the booth...</i>
<i>I had a very agile mind.</i>

242
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:49,261
..I could learn a song
by maybe hearing it once or twice.

243
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,770
<i>I traded my electric equipment</i>
<i>for an acoustic guitar.</i>

244
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,213
Started playing almost immediately.

245
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:07,217
There he is, down at the end of the bar.
Dylan! How are you?

246
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,848
Dylan Thomas, and he's looking shocked.

247
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,150
Out in Minnesota...

248
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,256
there was a young man who was inspired...

249
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,991
to change his name to Dylan...

250
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,090
because of the poet Dylan Thomas.

251
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,429
"Piety sings

252
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:30,468
"Innocence sweetens my last black breath

253
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:35,106
"Modesty hides my thighs in her wings

254
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,576
"And all the deadly virtues

255
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,083
"plague my death!"

256
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:49,817
<i>Why it became that particular name,</i>
<i>I really can't say.</i>

257
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,592
There was some intimation
that maybe he was changing his name...

258
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:54,995
'cause of a racial thing.

259
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,029
'Cause, I later found out...

260
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:01,162
that Minneapolis had a fairly big history
of being anti-Semitic...

261
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,400
which I wasn't aware of at all.

262
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,369
<i>The name just popped into my head</i>
<i>one day.</i>

263
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,344
<i>But it didn't really happen</i>
<i>any of the ways that I've read about it.</i>

264
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,507
I mean, I just don't feel like I had had a
past...

265
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,811
and, you know,
I couldn't relate to anything...

266
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,218
other than what I was doing
at the present time...

267
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,187
and I don't, you know...

268
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:24,188
Didn't matter to me what I said,
you know. It still doesn't, really.

269
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:30,898
<i>He sounded, like, average, I would say.</i>
<i>He wasn't the worst, he wasn't the best...</i>

270
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,698
but the repertoire was similar
to everybody else's repertoire...

271
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,137
Josh White, Odetta, Belafonte.

272
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,871
Right then and there I had no goal
except learning all the songs I could.

273
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,926
<i>He was hungry.</i>
<i>You know, hungry in a lot of ways...</i>

274
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,328
<i>not just for money, not just for fame...</i>

275
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:05,631
but he was hungry for experience,
for getting out, for doing it...

276
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,996
for seeing what was out there,
seeing who he could be.

277
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,512
<i>He was like a sponge in a way, like...</i>

278
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,014
pick up people's mannerisms, accents.

279
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,520
<i>I'd forgotten all about the Iron Range,</i>
<i>where I grew up.</i>

280
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,689
I'd forgotten about it all.

281
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,860
It didn't even enter my mind.

282
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,280
<i>Woody Guthrie, he had a particular sound.</i>

283
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,817
<i>And besides that, he said something</i>
<i>to go along with his sound.</i>

284
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,453
<i>That was highly unusual, to my ears.</i>

285
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,383
<i>He was a radical,</i>
<i>his songs had a radical slant.</i>

286
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:31,015
I thought, "ooh," you know, like...
"That's what I want to sing.

287
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,314
"I want to sing that."

288
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,663
<i>I couldn't believe</i>
<i>that I'd never heard of this man.</i>

289
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,568
<i>You could listen to his songs,</i>
<i>and actually learn how to live.</i>

290
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,905
<i>One guy said,</i>
<i>"You're singing a Woody Guthrie song."</i>

291
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,408
<i>He gave me a book that he wrote,</i>
<i>called</i> Bound for Glory, <i>and I read it.</i>

292
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,415
I identified with that <i>Bound for Glory</i> book...

293
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,812
more than I even did with <i>On the Road.</i>

294
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,853
<i>These songs sounded archaic</i>
<i>to most people.</i>

295
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,160
I don't know
why they didn't sound archaic to me.

296
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,992
They sounded like these songs
were happening at the moment, to me.

297
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,440
<i>Well, I see you got your</i>

298
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,080
<i>brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat</i>

299
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:34,280
<i>Yes, I see you got your</i>

300
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,622
<i>brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat</i>

301
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,590
<i>Well, you must tell me, baby</i>

302
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:46,255
<i>how your head feels</i>
<i>under somethin' like that</i>

303
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,764
<i>Under your brand new</i>
<i>leopard-skin pill-box hat</i>

304
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,129
<i>Well, you wear it so pretty</i>

305
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,605
<i>Honey, can I jump on it sometime?</i>

306
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,036
<i>Yes, I just wanna see</i>

307
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,740
<i>if it's really the expensive kind</i>

308
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,612
<i>You know it balances on your head</i>

309
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:13,054
<i>just like a mattress balances</i>
<i>on a bottle of wine</i>

310
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,321
<i>Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat</i>

311
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,114
<i>I asked the doctor if I could see you</i>

312
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,415
Fantastic, very good.

313
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,687
- Rank.
- Excellent.

314
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,627
- It was lousy, it was pathetic.
- He was great!

315
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,472
It said on the ticket
you came to see Dylan not a group.

316
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,836
Not a pop group.

317
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,779
Special paper, now, with all the pictures.

318
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,961
<i>I was just learning songs</i>
<i>and playing them...</i>

319
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,592
<i>and trying to find out</i>
<i>who Woody Guthrie was.</i>

320
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,097
Woody's records
were almost impossible to find.

321
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,443
They didn't have any of his records
in the record stores.

322
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,412
<i>Paul was a folk music scholar.</i>
<i>He didn't play at all.</i>

323
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,710
<i>He had a whole lot of records...</i>

324
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,479
which probably couldn't be found
anywhere else in the Midwest...

325
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,953
except at Paul's house,
and he lived there with somebody else.

326
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,189
You know, I was listening to records
at his house once.

327
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,058
I knew they'd be away for the weekend...

328
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,429
so I went over there and helped myself
to a bunch of old records.

329
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,207
<i>About 25 records disappeared,</i>
<i>mostly the stuff that Dylan was listening to.</i>

330
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,402
And we sort of figured out
that he'd taken them.

331
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,277
Those records were extremely hard to find.
They were like hen's teeth.

332
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,085
If you came across them,
somebody like myself...

333
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,950
who was a musical expeditionary...

334
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,354
you know, you just would have to
immerse yourself in them.

335
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,551
<i>So we started trying to track Dylan down.</i>

336
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,562
<i>We tried the fraternity house</i>
<i>where he had once been.</i>

337
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,122
<i>No luck there. We got another address,</i>
<i>and then yet another.</i>

338
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,964
<i>And everybody said,</i>
<i>"Boy, this kid must be popular," you know.</i>

339
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,597
<i>"You're about the tenth guy looking for him"</i>
<i>you know, at every place we went.</i>

340
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:46,973
<i>And I don't know how we finally found him,</i>
<i>but we got a current apartment.</i>

341
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:50,575
This was a John Wayne production number,
that John did.

342
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,617
He got a bowling pin,
and he got a big cigar...

343
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:57,051
and John was 6'4" or something like this.

344
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,749
And he wasn't ever intending to hit Dylan
with the bowling pin or anything...

345
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,726
but he was really gonna do the bit.

346
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,993
<i>John just started waving the bowling pin</i>
<i>over his head, and just saying.</i>;

347
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,069
<i>"I'm gonna beat the hell out of you.</i>
<i>Where are my records?"</i>

348
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,970
And Dylan was very scared
for the first time around this routine went.

349
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:19,043
But he maintained his cool somehow...

350
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,704
and it somehow settled
into sort of an absurdist drama...

351
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,010
where they would sort of talk.

352
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:30,181
Dylan would say something interesting,
and John would get interesting...

353
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,917
and they'd start to talk, and they'd start
to sort of like each other a little bit.

354
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,890
Then John would remember
why he was there...

355
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,121
and he'd start brandishing the pin again.

356
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,288
And they'd play the whole scene out again.

357
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:02,010
<i>I wanted to get to the East Coast</i>
<i>to visit Woody Guthrie.</i>

358
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,680
<i>When I first heard him, I didn't know</i>
<i>if he was dead or alive, really.</i>

359
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,953
But then I discovered
that he was definitely alive...

360
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,188
and he was in a hospital...

361
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,523
with some kind of ailment.

362
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,728
So I thought it'd be a nice gesture
to go visit him.

363
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:25,075
<i>Hitchhiking back then was very acceptable.</i>
<i>I had a suitcase and a guitar.</i>

364
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,780
<i>And I don't know,</i>
<i>maybe I had $ 10 in my pocket.</i>

365
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,289
<i>Joan Baez, she was staggering.</i>

366
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,533
<i>Kind of like hit my world</i>
<i>from a different angle.</i>

367
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,163
She was completely about folk music.

368
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:34,073
She was an excellent,
really excellent guitar player.

369
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,613
<i>When I saw her on television,</i>
<i>I thought, you know, like.</i>;

370
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,980
<i>"That girl looks like</i>
<i>she might need a singing partner. "</i>

371
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,850
I'd say she was someplace
in the back of my mind, you know.

372
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:50,149
<i>Let the word go forth</i>
<i>from this time and place...</i>

373
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,524
<i>to friend and foe alike...</i>

374
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,997
<i>that the torch has been passed</i>
<i>to a new generation of Americans.</i>

375
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:02,234
<i>Ask not what your country can do for you.</i>

376
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,706
<i>Ask what you can do for your country.</i>

377
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,978
<i>Got out of the car</i>
<i>on George Washington Bridge...</i>

378
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,309
<i>took the subway down to the Village.</i>

379
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:14,044
<i>Went to the Café Wha?</i>
<i>I looked out at the crowd.</i>

380
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,880
<i>I most likely asked from the stage.</i>;

381
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,479
<i>"Does anybody know where</i>
<i>a couple of people could stay tonight?"</i>

382
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:25,262
<i>It was in old Greenwich Village,</i>
<i>which was the '20s bohemia...</i>

383
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,829
<i>and had a very venerable history.</i>

384
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,127
<i>I first came down in 1948...</i>

385
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,130
with a red bandana around my neck...

386
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,831
on the subway to go...

387
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,306
to see if I could find poets...

388
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,701
in Greenwich Village.

389
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,074
But there had been poets.

390
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,139
<i>I probably came into the Village</i>
<i>around 1952 or '53. I was a kid.</i>

391
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,478
<i>I was living in Queens,</i>
<i>not liking it very much.</i>

392
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,885
And for me, it was very sophisticated.
I liked that.

393
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,490
<i>I was into jazz at the time.</i>

394
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,926
<i>I didn't like the folk music thing much at all,</i>
<i>I was very snobbish.</i>

395
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,055
Over across the street, there was Nick's.

396
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,133
<i>I actually met Tony Spargo...</i>

397
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,169
<i>who was the drummer</i>
<i>on the very first jazz records...</i>

398
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,536
with the Original Dixieland Jazz Band,
in 1917.

399
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,077
When I was young,
it was a very laid-back place...

400
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:20,248
<i>intermingled with various ethnic groups</i>
<i>were lots of what we called bohemians...</i>

401
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,546
<i>doing their art, walking their dogs.</i>

402
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:32,085
There was a wonderful creative climate there
although I didn't...

403
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:35,927
I wasn't fully aware of it,
but it was the center of the art world...

404
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,433
<i>happenings, the first art movements</i>
<i>were going on.</i>

405
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:39,998
It was all there.

406
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,996
You were suddenly able
to take your clothes off.

407
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:48,742
<i>You were suddenly free</i>
<i>of all the shackles of family...</i>

408
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,640
the baggage...

409
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,779
of tradition, of bad tradition.

410
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:59,788
<i>I was looking for freedom,</i>
<i>but freedom didn't exist all over America.</i>

411
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:03,691
Freedom only existed, really,
here in the Village, in Greenwich Village.

412
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,922
<i>"America, I've given you all,</i>
<i>and now I'm nothing</i>

413
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:12,298
<i>"America, two dollars</i>
<i>and twenty-seven cents January 17, 1956</i>

414
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,362
<i>"I can't stand my own mind</i>

415
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,271
<i>"America, when will we end the human war?</i>

416
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,603
<i>"Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb.</i>

417
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,679
<i>"I don't feel good; don't bother me</i>

418
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,908
<i>"I won't write my poem</i>
<i>until I'm in my right mind"</i>

419
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,947
<i>The big breakthrough...</i>

420
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,544
was in an ex-gay bar on MacDougal Street...

421
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,986
formerly the MacDougal Street Bar,
I think this was '58 or '59...

422
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,519
then called The Gaslight.

423
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:44,997
And it was the first poetry reading
in one of these sort of coffee shop/bars...

424
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:48,071
sort of a folk club/coffee shop/bar.

425
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,767
And it was so astonishing
that there was a story on Page 3...

426
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,870
a whole page in the <i>Daily News.</i>;
"Poets Reading in the Coffee Shop."

427
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,915
<i>"America, when will you be angelic?</i>

428
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,916
<i>"When will you take off your clothes?</i>

429
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,282
<i>"When will you look at yourself</i>
<i>through the grave?</i>

430
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,322
<i>"When will you be worthy</i>
<i>of your million Trotskyites?</i>

431
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,450
<i>"America, why are your libraries</i>
<i>full of tears?</i>

432
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,318
<i>"America, when will you send</i>
<i>your eggs to India?</i>

433
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,193
<i>"I'm sick of your insane demands.</i>

434
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,631
<i>"When can I go into the supermarket</i>
<i>and buy what I need with my good looks?"</i>

435
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,033
Down the block here was the San Remo.

436
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,071
<i>And every Saturday night</i>
<i>you'd have the riots...</i>

437
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,403
<i>between the Stalinists and the Trotskyites.</i>

438
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,976
Glasses flying, that sort of thing.

439
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,843
<i>There's an old bitch upstairs</i>
<i>who keeps pounding the floor...</i>

440
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,114
and she's threatening to call the police
all the time.

441
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,781
<i>We used to be out at the bar here</i>
<i>with James Baldwin, the writer.</i>

442
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,226
And he used to puff smoke:

443
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:47,161
"This goddamn Irish music!"

444
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,441
And the whole place would erupt:

445
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,525
<i>In Washington Square, early days,</i>
<i>it was just a place...</i>

446
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,963
<i>for people to hang out on Sundays</i>
<i>and talk and play music...</i>

447
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,625
<i>and kind of jockey around</i>
<i>and express themselves.</i>

448
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:29,763
<i>It was a place where you could put it</i>
<i>together so someone could hear a little bit.</i>

449
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,001
There weren't many concerts in those days.

450
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,689
<i>People were starting to play little gigs</i>
<i>in these coffeehouses in the Village.</i>

451
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,425
<i>We called them basket houses.</i>

452
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,025
We didn't get paid a dime but we would
pass a little bread basket around...

453
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,468
after the set
and people would throw change in...

454
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,439
and then we'd pack up our guitars
and go round to the next club.

455
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,854
<i>They'd put the singers on in between</i>
<i>beat poets to turn the house, essentially.</i>

456
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,387
So you'd get...

457
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,389
three songs, you could sing three songs.

458
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,828
And what it came down to is...

459
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:31,459
if at the end of your three songs
there was still anybody seated...

460
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:35,403
in the house, you were fired.
You weren't doing your job.

461
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:40,210
Needless to say, we didn't get fired.
That we could do.

462
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,389
<i>When we played in the city,</i>
<i>who was the audience?</i>

463
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,265
<i>Who were those people walking</i>
<i>up and down MacDougal Street?</i>

464
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,530
<i>There was a lot of them.</i>

465
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:11,734
<i>Some were people from the suburbs</i>
<i>coming in to look at the weird scene.</i>

466
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,833
<i>Some were from the city</i>
<i>looking at the weird scene.</i>

467
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,275
<i>Some were the weird scene.</i>

468
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:19,605
It was never clear that this was the audience
and this was the singer.

469
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,880
Because maybe half the audience
if they had their druthers...

470
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,184
they'd be up on the stage singing as well.
It was very interesting.

471
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,852
<i>I was ready for New York.</i>

472
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,320
<i>I started playing immediately</i>
<i>and I realized right away...</i>

473
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,992
<i>that I'd come to the right place,</i>
<i>because there were many places to play.</i>

474
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,399
<i>I played with Freddy Neil.</i>
<i>He was a big star down there.</i>

475
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,479
<i>I did that until about 8.</i>;<i>00,</i>
<i>he would give me what he could.</i>

476
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,913
<i>The place was usually packed</i>
<i>from 12.</i>;<i>00 to 8.</i>;<i>00...</i>

477
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,746
<i>with tourists and lunch-hour secretaries.</i>

478
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:33,085
And then at 8:00
all the rest of the houses would open...

479
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,454
where you'd pass the basket and play.

480
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,789
<i>Check it out.</i>

481
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,830
<i>There'd be a carny on the street</i>
<i>bringing people down.</i>

482
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,922
<i>"You know, you gotta come down here</i>
<i>and see this.</i>

483
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,467
<i>"There's so much weirdness</i>
<i>you've never seen in your life. "</i>

484
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,537
<i>Just always,</i>
<i>there'd be people coming and going.</i>

485
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,868
<i>I have studied at Oxford University...</i>

486
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,534
<i>I've done my research</i>
<i>at the British Museum...</i>

487
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,611
<i>and have matriculated at Brooklyn College.</i>

488
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,237
<i>Sawdust on the floor, tourist traps...</i>

489
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,647
<i>like, a poet, somebody singing a song</i>
<i>with a parrot on a shoulder...</i>

490
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,584
<i>Tiny Tim-type characters.</i>

491
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,555
<i>No one who had any recordings out</i>
<i>ever played them.</i>

492
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,823
You only played those if you had to.

493
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,794
<i>You would have to</i>
<i>make an impression on somebody.</i>

494
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,129
<i>There were many, many singers</i>
<i>who were good...</i>

495
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,229
<i>but they couldn't focus</i>
<i>their attention on anybody.</i>

496
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,204
They couldn't really
get inside somebody's head.

497
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,307
<i>You gotta be able to pin somebody down.</i>

498
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:40,023
<i>I remember him because he was different.</i>
<i>He was doing Woody Guthrie songs.</i>

499
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:44,025
<i>He had on a little hat, he had a brace.</i>

500
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,564
There's a quality of determination...

501
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,633
and of will that some people have...

502
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:54,093
where when they're doing something,
they're really doing it...

503
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,695
and you know that
you have to pay attention to them.

504
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,668
<i>I first met Bob in the winter of 1961.</i>

505
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,542
<i>We were awkward.</i>
<i>Neither of us really knew quite what to say.</i>

506
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,185
So as a prop he pulled out this card.

507
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,744
And he was moving his leg like that
and he just hands me the card.

508
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,552
And after he handed it to me
he kind of glances and then...

509
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,389
continues to sort of
talk about Woody Guthrie.

510
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:23,091
And on the card it said,
"I ain't dead yet," signed, Woody Guthrie.

511
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:28,164
And it was actually Woody's handwriting,
I guess, because Bob claimed it was.

512
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,972
<i>Like, Woody was very important</i>
<i>to both of us.</i>

513
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,839
<i>Bob, I think, wanted to be</i>
<i>more like Woody than I did.</i>

514
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,811
<i>He was able to adopt</i>
<i>a kind of theater about himself.</i>

515
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:41,044
Actually, the very first time that I met him,
he was really acting, in a way.

516
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,916
And that was good because you can
go anywhere when you're somebody else.

517
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:50,293
<i>Cinderella, she seems so easy</i>

518
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:53,955
<i>"It takes one to know one," she smiles</i>

519
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,325
<i>And puts her hands into her back pockets</i>

520
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,231
<i>Bette Davis style</i>

521
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,238
<i>And in comes Romeo, he's moaning</i>

522
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:10,169
<i>"You Belong to Me, I Believe"</i>

523
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,651
<i>And someone turns and says to him</i>

524
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:18,188
<i>"My friend, you'd better leave"</i>

525
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:22,784
<i>And the only sound that's left</i>

526
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,853
<i>after the ambulances go</i>

527
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:31,326
<i>is Cinderella sweeping up</i>

528
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,666
<i>on Desolation Row</i>

529
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,167
<i>Now the moon is almost hidden</i>

530
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,838
<i>The stars, they're just pretending to hide</i>

531
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,815
<i>The fortune-telling lady</i>

532
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:53,614
<i>has even taken all her things inside</i>

533
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,989
<i>All except for Cain and Abel</i>

534
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:01,920
<i>And the Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>

535
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,228
<i>Everyone is either making love</i>

536
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,669
<i>or else expecting rain</i>

537
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:14,270
<i>And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing</i>

538
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,413
<i>He's getting ready for the show</i>

539
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,613
<i>He's going to the carnival tonight</i>

540
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,121
<i>on Desolation Row</i>

541
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,653
- I want to see this person immediately.
- What?

542
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,250
Whoever's gonna shoot me.

543
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,557
How do you find that out, Albert?

544
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,569
Phoned the box office
and they say they're gonna shoot me.

545
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,867
Do they do this often?

546
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,277
I don't mind being shot, man,
but I don't dig being told about it.

547
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,976
Man, I can't believe that.

548
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:56,814
- Don't worry, Mickey. I'll protect you.
- I hope so.

549
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,987
God.

550
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:05,260
Don't tell me not to push too hard, man.
I'm worried about getting shot.

551
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,159
I'm not gonna push too hard.

552
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:25,306
<i>Obviously, he was channeling</i>
<i>Woody Guthrie.</i>

553
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,009
He was literally channeling him
and everything about him.

554
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,349
And I think it was part of his way
of finding who he was in the end...

555
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,456
by imitating and assimilating Woody Guthrie.

556
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,463
<i>So I found out where Woody Guthrie was,</i>
<i>and I took a bus out to Morristown.</i>

557
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,035
<i>Basically, I think it was an insane asylum.</i>

558
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:49,537
<i>I thought about it later, it was a sad thing,</i>
<i>they put him in a mental home...</i>

559
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,505
<i>because he just had the jitters.</i>

560
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,212
<i>He asked for certain songs</i>
<i>and I'd play them.</i>

561
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:04,909
I was young and impressionable
and I think I must have been shocked...

562
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:08,185
in some kind of way
to find him where I found him.

563
00:47:23,638 --> 00:47:27,096
<i>Brother John Sellers, he was the</i>
<i>master of ceremonies at Gerde's Folk City.</i>

564
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:31,242
And there was one night called
Hootenanny Night where anybody could play.

565
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:54,532
<i>We'd go down there every Monday night.</i>

566
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:59,267
Peter LaFarge, who was
sort of a cowboy/lndian...

567
00:47:59,374 --> 00:48:01,239
and Cisco Houston.

568
00:48:01,342 --> 00:48:04,505
A lot of the old Woody Guthrie crowd
was still hanging out there.

569
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:14,748
<i>We just watched and we picked out</i>
<i>the performers that were doing it for real...</i>

570
00:48:14,856 --> 00:48:18,952
and tried to pick up what the essence
of what they were doing was.

571
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,362
All of us were interested in seeing
what the other guy was doing onstage...

572
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:25,591
because there was
a lot more to be learned...

573
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,692
than just songs or picking styles.

574
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:40,336
<i>Dave Van Ronk,</i>
<i>he had that big gruff thing...</i>

575
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:44,714
<i>but he had this very sweet, sensitive thing</i>
<i>going on at the same time.</i>

576
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:47,083
<i>He was a dichotomy of a performer.</i>

577
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,060
<i>He could take the essence of the song...</i>

578
00:48:55,163 --> 00:48:58,257
<i>and only go after that,</i>
<i>not go after the frills.</i>

579
00:48:58,933 --> 00:49:01,800
<i>On Monday nights,</i>
<i>Bob Dylan used to come over there...</i>

580
00:49:01,903 --> 00:49:03,803
<i>and he would always, like...</i>

581
00:49:03,905 --> 00:49:07,306
He was always just hanging around.

582
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:10,502
Sometimes you wanted to say, "Go away."

583
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:42,801
Liam was profound.

584
00:49:44,245 --> 00:49:46,679
Besides all of his rebel songs...

585
00:49:47,582 --> 00:49:50,312
and his acting career,
he would have these incredible sayings.

586
00:49:50,418 --> 00:49:54,718
Like once he said to me
after about 30 pints of Guinness...

587
00:49:54,822 --> 00:49:57,757
he was saying, "Remember, Bob, no fear...

588
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:00,259
"no envy, no meanness."

589
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:03,924
I said, "Right."

590
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,427
<i>What I heard in the Clancy Brothers</i>
<i>was rousing, rebel songs...</i>

591
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,361
<i>Napoleonic in scope.</i>

592
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:49,204
<i>And they were just these</i>
<i>Musketeer-type characters.</i>

593
00:50:49,443 --> 00:50:53,971
<i>And then on the other level you had</i>
<i>the romantic ballads that would just...</i>

594
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:59,351
<i>slay you right in your tracks,</i>
<i>the sweetness of Tommy Makem and Liam.</i>

595
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,247
<i>It was just like, take a sword,</i>
<i>cut off your head, and then weep.</i>

596
00:51:04,058 --> 00:51:06,549
<i>That's sort of what they were about.</i>

597
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:42,321
<i>All the great performers that I'd seen...</i>

598
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,126
<i>who I wanted to be like</i>
<i>were those kind of performers...</i>

599
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:46,665
<i>they all had one thing in common.</i>;

600
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:51,295
It was in their eyes.

601
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:53,936
Now, there was something in their eyes
that would say:

602
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:57,442
"I know something you don't know,"
and I wanted to be that kind of performer.

603
00:52:13,594 --> 00:52:16,893
<i>I am a man of constant sorrow</i>

604
00:52:16,998 --> 00:52:20,798
<i>I've seen trouble all my days</i>

605
00:52:26,173 --> 00:52:30,007
<i>I'll say goodbye to Colorado</i>

606
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:34,279
<i>Where I was born and partly raised</i>

607
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,494
<i>Through this open world</i>
<i>I'm a-bound to ramble</i>

608
00:52:57,905 --> 00:53:01,705
<i>Through ice and snow, sleet and rain</i>

609
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:10,113
<i>I'm a-bound to ride that morning railroad</i>

610
00:53:10,217 --> 00:53:14,244
<i>Perhaps I'll die upon that train</i>

611
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:37,867
<i>He was playing at some party or something</i>
<i>and it was like a whole different guy.</i>

612
00:53:37,978 --> 00:53:39,775
You hear those stories
about the blues men...

613
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,747
who go out to the crossroads
and sell their soul to the devil...

614
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,909
and come back,
all of a sudden able to do stuff...

615
00:53:45,019 --> 00:53:48,250
Robert Johnson, Tommy Johnson,
that whole mythology.

616
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:50,653
It was one of those kind of deals, almost.

617
00:53:50,758 --> 00:53:53,124
<i>When he left Minneapolis</i>
<i>he was just average.</i>

618
00:53:53,227 --> 00:53:56,094
<i>There was five, six other guys</i>
<i>doing the same thing.</i>

619
00:53:56,197 --> 00:53:58,165
<i>When he came back he was doing Woody...</i>

620
00:53:58,265 --> 00:54:00,893
<i>and he was doing Van Ronk</i>
<i>and he was fingerpicking.</i>

621
00:54:01,001 --> 00:54:04,198
He was playing cross harp,
and this is a matter of a couple of months.

622
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:07,206
I mean, this is not like
he was gone a year or anything.

623
00:54:07,308 --> 00:54:10,471
He was gone a couple of months
and apparently whatever he got into...

624
00:54:10,578 --> 00:54:14,571
he got into so intensely that
he was like a real interesting performer.

625
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:18,410
That's when I went to the crossroads
and made a big deal.

626
00:54:18,686 --> 00:54:20,278
You know, like...

627
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:27,054
One night and then
went back to Minneapolis...

628
00:54:27,161 --> 00:54:29,959
and it was like, "Hey, where's this guy been?

629
00:54:31,065 --> 00:54:33,363
"You've been to the crossroads."

630
00:54:47,248 --> 00:54:48,909
<i>I wasn't seeing Woody Guthrie anymore.</i>

631
00:54:49,016 --> 00:54:50,608
<i>I was still singing a lot of his songs...</i>

632
00:54:50,718 --> 00:54:53,881
<i>but I'd replaced them with</i>
<i>a lot of the other songs, all of a sudden.</i>

633
00:54:53,988 --> 00:54:56,354
<i>I kind of went through Woody Guthrie</i>
<i>in a kind of way.</i>

634
00:54:56,457 --> 00:54:58,482
<i>But I didn't really want</i>
<i>to go through Woody Guthrie.</i>

635
00:54:58,592 --> 00:55:02,255
<i>I didn't want to feel that</i>
<i>it was something just negligible.</i>

636
00:55:02,363 --> 00:55:06,026
<i>Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie,</i>
<i>I wrote you a song</i>

637
00:55:08,836 --> 00:55:12,602
<i>About a funny ol' world that's a-coming</i>
along

638
00:55:15,376 --> 00:55:20,040
<i>Seems sick and it's hungry,</i>
<i>it's tired and it's torn</i>

639
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:26,811
<i>It looks like it's a-dyin'</i>

640
00:55:26,921 --> 00:55:29,116
<i>and it's hardly been born</i>

641
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:34,259
<i>But I really cared, I really wanted to portray</i>
<i>my gratitude in some kind of way.</i>

642
00:55:34,595 --> 00:55:38,224
<i>But I knew that I was not gonna be</i>
<i>going back to Greystone anymore.</i>

643
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:44,995
I felt like I had to write that song.
I did not consider myself a songwriter at all.

644
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:50,038
But I needed to write that
and I needed to sing it.

645
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:53,645
So that's why I needed to write it.

646
00:55:53,747 --> 00:55:57,615
'Cause it hadn't been written and that's what
I needed to say, I needed to say that.

647
00:55:57,718 --> 00:56:01,711
<i>Here's to Cisco and Sonny</i>
<i>and Lead Belly, too</i>

648
00:56:04,592 --> 00:56:08,688
<i>And to all the good people</i>
<i>that traveled with you</i>

649
00:56:11,565 --> 00:56:15,296
<i>Here's to the hearts</i>
<i>and the hands of the men</i>

650
00:56:18,005 --> 00:56:22,533
<i>that come with the dust</i>

651
00:56:22,643 --> 00:56:25,077
<i>and are gone with the wind</i>

652
00:56:26,213 --> 00:56:27,407
<i>So this guy comes in.</i>

653
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:32,144
He didn't look too prepossessing.
He didn't look too interesting to me.

654
00:56:32,253 --> 00:56:34,414
He didn't look wild or...

655
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:37,552
He looked like an ordinary kid.

656
00:56:38,392 --> 00:56:41,122
He didn't have the commanding presence.

657
00:56:41,996 --> 00:56:46,296
And he said, "Listen, I got some songs
I wanted you to hear."

658
00:56:46,433 --> 00:56:48,492
So I was, "Oh, God.
Can you come tomorrow?"

659
00:56:48,602 --> 00:56:51,400
I says, "Get out of here."
He says, "No, I want to sing you a song."

660
00:56:51,505 --> 00:56:53,769
So I let him sing the song,
then I kick him out...

661
00:56:53,874 --> 00:56:55,899
then he comes back, then he came back.

662
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,912
And then I started pointing to people, I said,
"Listen, see that guy in the back room?

663
00:57:00,014 --> 00:57:02,278
"His name is Bob Dylan.
You should listen to him.

664
00:57:02,383 --> 00:57:04,112
"The guy's writing good songs. He's terrific."

665
00:57:05,085 --> 00:57:07,019
<i>He told me he never knew</i>
<i>the word folk music...</i>

666
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:09,112
<i>before he came to New York City.</i>
<i>What bullshit, God!</i>

667
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:13,760
And he'd never seen somebody playing
a banjo before he came to New York City.

668
00:57:13,861 --> 00:57:16,523
He'd never seen all these things
before he came to New York City.

669
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:19,258
It opened his eyes up wide
to what folk music is...

670
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:21,766
after having lived on the Mississippi River
and everything.

671
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:26,431
"I was born in Duluth, Minnesota, in 1941.
Moved to Gallup, New Mexico.

672
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:28,268
"Then, until now...

673
00:57:29,476 --> 00:57:33,378
"lived in lowa, South Dakota, Kansas,
North Dakota, for a little bit.

674
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:37,810
"Started playing in carnivals
when I was 14 with guitar and piano."

675
00:57:37,918 --> 00:57:40,352
"Arvella Gray taught him blues songs...

676
00:57:40,454 --> 00:57:43,321
"a blind street singer from Chicago,
about four or five years ago.

677
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:47,190
"Used to know a guy named
Mance Lipscomb, from Navasota, Texas.

678
00:57:47,294 --> 00:57:51,060
"Listened to him a lot. Met him
through his grandson, a rock 'n' roller."

679
00:57:51,165 --> 00:57:54,498
Now, listened to Arvella Gray in Chicago...

680
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:56,398
Mance Lipscomb in Texas...

681
00:57:56,503 --> 00:57:59,165
I should have figured out right away,
he's bullshitting me.

682
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:01,537
And I only found out later...

683
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:04,935
that he had borrowed 400 records
from Tony Glover...

684
00:58:05,045 --> 00:58:08,344
or something like that,
which he still hasn't returned.

685
00:58:08,449 --> 00:58:10,440
And things like that.

686
00:58:10,918 --> 00:58:14,649
So I was a setup, a very easy setup,
and I'm proud of it.

687
00:58:14,755 --> 00:58:17,724
Because the guy wrote good songs.
I didn't care what he was telling me.

688
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:20,119
<i>I saw it advertised one day</i>

689
00:58:20,227 --> 00:58:22,661
<i>A Bear Mountain picnic was comin' my way</i>

<i>Fun for all</i>

694
00:58:34,174 --> 00:58:35,141
<i>Yippee</i>

695
00:58:37,011 --> 00:58:39,639
<i>The owner of the place</i>
<i>finally gave me a two-week run.</i>

696
00:58:41,415 --> 00:58:42,973
<i>He had me open for John Lee Hooker.</i>

697
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:45,347
<i>Well, it don't seem to me quite so funny</i>

698
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:48,751
<i>What some of these people</i>
<i>are gonna do for money</i>

699
00:58:48,856 --> 00:58:51,484
<i>There's a brand new gimmick every day</i>

700
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:53,651
<i>Just to take somebody's money away</i>

701
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:56,389
<i>I didn't really feel like</i>
<i>I was making a step forward anywhere.</i>

702
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:59,292
Things were taking its natural course.

703
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:02,902
<i>Now, November 4,</i>
<i>Bob Dylan will be singing.</i>

704
00:59:04,405 --> 00:59:06,600
<i>And that should be a very eventful occasion.</i>

705
00:59:06,707 --> 00:59:08,572
<i>Bob was born in Duluth, Minnesota...</i>

706
00:59:08,675 --> 00:59:11,371
<i>but, Bob, you weren't raised</i>
<i>in Duluth, were you?</i>

707
00:59:11,478 --> 00:59:14,413
<i>I was raised in Gallup, New Mexico.</i>

708
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:16,311
<i>And did you get many songs there?</i>

709
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:18,817
<i>Got a lot of cowboy songs there.</i>
<i>Indian songs.</i>

710
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:21,183
<i>Well, I'm gonna get you, Sally gal</i>

711
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:23,188
<i>I'm gonna get you, Sally gal</i>

712
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,315
<i>I'm gonna get you, Sally gal</i>

713
00:59:25,426 --> 00:59:27,189
<i>I'm gonna get you, Sally gal</i>

714
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:31,128
<i>I didn't start to have any ambition</i>
<i>until I started working more and more.</i>

715
00:59:31,231 --> 00:59:35,190
<i>I wondered how people recorded.</i>
<i>I wondered how you get to do that.</i>

716
00:59:35,302 --> 00:59:39,033
<i>There were always talent scouts</i>
<i>in the clubs.</i>

717
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:42,302
No one had ever spoken to me directly
about making any records...

718
00:59:42,409 --> 00:59:44,434
so I just assumed they'd passed on me.

719
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,678
<i>The most important new vocal personality</i>
<i>of recent years.</i>;

720
00:59:53,687 --> 00:59:58,386
<i>Johnny Mathis, who vaulted over</i>
<i>a Columbia microphone to stardom.</i>

721
01:00:02,729 --> 01:00:06,324
I always looked for songs that had
a kind of excellence, lasting quality...

722
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:10,426
<i>and artists who produced</i>
<i>a beautiful sound with their voice.</i>

723
01:00:10,604 --> 01:00:14,370
<i>From 1953, I was a head of A&R</i>
<i>at Columbia.</i>

724
01:00:33,026 --> 01:00:34,493
<i>That was the sound of the day.</i>

725
01:00:34,595 --> 01:00:38,497
People would want to hear
a beautiful voice sing a melodic song.

726
01:00:38,665 --> 01:00:40,826
- John, are you gonna do one, or was I?
- You will.

727
01:00:40,934 --> 01:00:44,370
Okay. I'll do <i>Man of Constant Sorrow</i>
then with the autoharp.

728
01:00:57,651 --> 01:00:59,084
<i>We recorded for Folkways.</i>

729
01:00:59,186 --> 01:01:02,383
<i>We lived in the clear, pure light</i>
<i>of non-commercial...</i>

730
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:05,083
long-playing, short-selling records
for Folkways.

731
01:01:05,192 --> 01:01:08,457
I learned it from a record that was made
down in the Southern mountains...

732
01:01:08,562 --> 01:01:10,359
in the late 1920s.

733
01:01:10,464 --> 01:01:14,195
<i>We also seemed to represent</i>
<i>some idea about, excuse the expression...</i>

734
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:18,237
<i>integrity, or standing for something</i>
<i>authentic or real in music.</i>

735
01:01:25,746 --> 01:01:27,976
<i>We were always pointing</i>
<i>to other people's music...</i>

736
01:01:28,081 --> 01:01:31,710
<i>pointing to old singers,</i>
<i>Appalachian singers, blues singers.</i>

737
01:01:31,952 --> 01:01:34,512
I think we were set up as a...

738
01:01:36,456 --> 01:01:37,548
pillar of virtue.

739
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:52,700
<i>The folksinging scene</i>
<i>was either commercial folksinging...</i>

740
01:01:52,806 --> 01:01:56,970
for like a college kind of crowd:
Harry Belafonte, Brothers Four...

741
01:01:57,077 --> 01:02:01,104
that commercial... They had records
that were on the pop charts.

742
01:02:01,782 --> 01:02:04,774
And then there was the other side,
which was intellectual.

743
01:02:04,885 --> 01:02:07,911
People would just sit there,
you know, I think...

744
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:12,885
And playing in the environment
that I was playing in...

745
01:02:13,193 --> 01:02:14,626
was neither of those.

746
01:02:15,062 --> 01:02:18,964
I took him up to Folkways Records and
that's written about in my notebook here...

747
01:02:19,066 --> 01:02:21,534
where they treated him like shit.
They wouldn't talk to him.

748
01:02:21,635 --> 01:02:24,160
And he writes, "God,
I thought I came into the wrong place."

749
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:26,831
<i>Sing Out</i> on the door,
"Folkways" on the door...

750
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,068
Moe Asch, Irwin Silber, rejects him,
throw him out on the street.

751
01:02:30,177 --> 01:02:32,577
And he really felt bad about it
and I felt bad about it...

752
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:36,012
'cause I don't push people every day.
I've only pushed two people in my life.

753
01:02:36,116 --> 01:02:40,917
I take him up to Maynard Solomon,
at Vanguard Records.

754
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:43,650
And they say no.

755
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:47,888
And many years later I said,
"Why did you say no to him?"

756
01:02:48,161 --> 01:02:51,619
And he said, "Well, lzzy, we don't
record freaks at Vanguard Records."

757
01:02:51,732 --> 01:02:54,428
I said, "I see. Joan Baez, not a freak.

758
01:02:54,534 --> 01:02:57,162
"The other people not...
Nobody's a freak, just Bob Dylan."

759
01:02:57,437 --> 01:02:59,632
<i>I was standing in the audience</i>
<i>with Maynard Solomon.</i>

760
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,732
<i>Maynard says, "What do you think of him?"</i>
<i>I said, "That's good!"</i>

761
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:06,280
I said, "What do you think of him?"
He says, "It's too visceral."

762
01:03:46,153 --> 01:03:49,953
<i>John discovered Billie Holiday,</i>
<i>Blind Boy Fuller, Lena Horne...</i>

763
01:03:50,057 --> 01:03:51,388
Count Basie.

764
01:03:51,491 --> 01:03:55,689
Yeah, he was kind of like a Damon Runyon
character. Is that the word?

765
01:03:55,796 --> 01:03:58,822
One of these old Broadway guys,
buzz-cut haircut.

766
01:03:58,932 --> 01:04:01,867
<i>He was very special in a lot of ways.</i>
<i>He was very enthusiastic.</i>

767
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:05,062
<i>He had great love of music,</i>
<i>and it just radiated out of him.</i>

768
01:04:05,172 --> 01:04:08,005
<i>When I met him, a review had</i>
<i>just come out of</i>The New York Times...

769
01:04:08,108 --> 01:04:10,576
<i>of the set I'd played at Gerde's</i>
<i>the previous night.</i>

770
01:04:10,677 --> 01:04:13,407
<i>Hammond had seen the article</i>
<i>and asked me right then and there...</i>

771
01:04:13,513 --> 01:04:16,380
<i>whether I wanted to record</i>
<i>for Columbia Records.</i>

772
01:04:16,483 --> 01:04:21,045
I thought it was almost unreal.
I mean, no one would think that...

773
01:04:22,189 --> 01:04:25,625
this kind of folk music would be
recorded on Columbia Records.

774
01:04:25,892 --> 01:04:28,520
John called me in my office at Columbia.

775
01:04:28,628 --> 01:04:30,926
He says, "Come on down,
I want you to hear something."

776
01:04:31,031 --> 01:04:33,465
<i>He didn't tell me who it was or anything.</i>
<i>I come down.</i>

777
01:04:33,567 --> 01:04:37,833
<i>There's this kid, all dressed up,</i>
<i>with the boots and the suede jacket...</i>

778
01:04:37,938 --> 01:04:39,405
<i>and he had the harmonica on.</i>

779
01:04:39,506 --> 01:04:42,998
<i>And he was singing</i>
<i>in this, you know, rough-edged voice.</i>

780
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:47,207
I will admit I didn't see the greatness of it.

781
01:04:47,314 --> 01:04:49,509
They recorded the popular hits of the day...

782
01:04:49,616 --> 01:04:52,380
of people usually
with beautiful tones of voices...

783
01:04:52,486 --> 01:04:56,820
and great arrangements.

784
01:04:58,191 --> 01:05:01,820
I don't know what they thought
of my stuff up there.

785
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:06,331
He has no voice, I mean
he doesn't produce a beautiful sound.

786
01:05:06,433 --> 01:05:11,063
I was used to finding guys
like Bennett and Damone and Mathis.

787
01:05:11,171 --> 01:05:15,403
But when somebody like John Hammond
is so confident of somebody's talent...

788
01:05:15,509 --> 01:05:19,639
you have to respect that,
for no other reason than his track record.

789
01:05:20,213 --> 01:05:22,477
I didn't tell anybody for a bit...

790
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:25,881
because I almost wasn't sure
it was happening myself.

791
01:05:29,489 --> 01:05:32,856
I don't think I really told anybody
until I actually...

792
01:05:34,227 --> 01:05:35,717
went through with the sessions.

793
01:05:36,596 --> 01:05:39,030
<i>I first heard this from Rick Von Schmidt.</i>

794
01:05:41,368 --> 01:05:43,233
<i>He lives in Cambridge.</i>

795
01:05:43,603 --> 01:05:46,128
<i>I met him one day in...</i>

796
01:05:47,407 --> 01:05:50,274
<i>the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>

797
01:05:51,111 --> 01:05:54,308
<i>I have a habit I picked up</i>
<i>someplace along the way.</i>

798
01:05:54,481 --> 01:05:58,611
Whatever works for me,
not to give that away...

799
01:05:59,853 --> 01:06:01,320
so easily, you know.

800
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:04,413
<i>Baby, let me follow you down</i>

801
01:06:05,392 --> 01:06:08,054
<i>Baby, let me follow you down</i>

802
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:11,989
<i>Well, I'll do anything</i>
<i>in this God almighty world</i>

803
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:14,658
<i>If you just let me follow you down</i>

804
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:17,065
When I did make that first record...

805
01:06:17,938 --> 01:06:22,500
I used songs which I just knew
but I hadn't really performed them a lot.

806
01:06:22,843 --> 01:06:26,142
<i>I wanted just to record stuff</i>
<i>that was off the top of my head...</i>

807
01:06:26,246 --> 01:06:27,304
<i>and see what would happen.</i>

808
01:06:27,414 --> 01:06:30,440
<i>There is a house</i>

809
01:06:30,784 --> 01:06:33,378
<i>down in New Orleans</i>

810
01:06:34,888 --> 01:06:39,484
<i>They call The Rising Sun</i>

811
01:06:42,095 --> 01:06:45,587
<i>And it's been the ruin</i>

812
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:48,662
<i>of many a poor girl</i>

813
01:06:49,669 --> 01:06:54,333
<i>And me, oh, God, I'm one</i>

814
01:06:54,741 --> 01:06:56,766
The House of the Rising Sun
<i>is on that record.</i>

815
01:06:56,877 --> 01:06:58,105
I'd never done that song before...

816
01:06:58,211 --> 01:07:00,702
but I heard it every night
'cause Van Ronk would do it.

817
01:07:01,281 --> 01:07:06,014
So I thought he was really on to something
with the song, so I just recorded it.

818
01:07:06,453 --> 01:07:08,944
Bobby picked up the chord changes...

819
01:07:10,223 --> 01:07:12,953
for the song from me.

820
01:07:14,961 --> 01:07:19,660
It really altered the song considerably,
although the lyric was...

821
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:23,526
pretty much the straight
<i>House of the Rising Sun</i> lyric...

822
01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:25,468
and so was the melody.

823
01:07:26,606 --> 01:07:30,098
And when he was doing,
I guess it was his first album...

824
01:07:31,745 --> 01:07:35,306
he asked me if I would mind...

825
01:07:35,415 --> 01:07:38,873
if he recorded my version
of <i>House of the Rising Sun.</i>

826
01:07:40,587 --> 01:07:44,045
And I had some plans to record it.

827
01:07:44,157 --> 01:07:47,320
So I said, "Well, gee, Bob,
I'd rather you didn't...

828
01:07:47,427 --> 01:07:50,260
"because I'm gonna record it myself soon."

829
01:07:50,797 --> 01:07:52,697
And Bobby said, "Oh-oh."

830
01:07:55,669 --> 01:07:59,105
<i>The mystery of being in a recording studio</i>
<i>did something to me...</i>

831
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:00,797
<i>and those are the songs that came out.</i>

832
01:08:00,907 --> 01:08:03,467
<i>Now the only thing</i>

833
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:06,779
<i>a gambler needs</i>

834
01:08:08,281 --> 01:08:12,547
<i>is a suitcase and a trunk</i>

835
01:08:15,088 --> 01:08:17,818
After he recorded it,
I had to stop singing the song...

836
01:08:17,924 --> 01:08:20,290
because people were constantly...

837
01:08:22,896 --> 01:08:26,354
accusing me of having got the song
from Bobby's record.

838
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:31,299
Now that was very, very annoying.

839
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:34,830
But I couldn't blame that on him
and I didn't.

840
01:08:35,442 --> 01:08:37,137
The whole thing was a tempest in a teapot.

841
01:08:37,243 --> 01:08:42,112
Later on, when Eric Burdon and the Animals
picked the song up from Bobby...

842
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:46,246
and recorded it, Bobby told me
that he had had to drop the song...

843
01:08:46,353 --> 01:08:50,016
because everybody was accusing him
of ripping it off of Eric Burdon!

844
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:52,985
<i>Feelin' funny in my mind, Lord</i>

845
01:08:53,093 --> 01:08:55,254
<i>I believe I'm fixin' to die</i>

846
01:08:55,362 --> 01:08:59,423
<i>When I got the disk, I played it</i>
<i>and I was highly disturbed.</i>

847
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:03,158
I just wanted to cross this record out
and make another record immediately.

848
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:05,396
I thought I'd recorded the wrong songs...

849
01:09:05,505 --> 01:09:09,339
and I'd already written a few of my own,
that I thought maybe...

850
01:09:09,442 --> 01:09:11,706
I should have stuck on there.
I was way past that record.

851
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:13,210
Or part of me was just saying...

852
01:09:13,313 --> 01:09:16,339
that I didn't want to record
that record anyway, that I just did it...

853
01:09:16,449 --> 01:09:19,885
I didn't want to give away
anything that was really...

854
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:25,351
dear to me or something.

855
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:28,894
<i>When Bobby signed with Columbia,</i>
<i>it was big news on the street.</i>

856
01:09:28,995 --> 01:09:30,792
<i>Everybody wanted that.</i>

857
01:09:30,897 --> 01:09:34,196
People couldn't bring themselves to admit...

858
01:09:35,635 --> 01:09:38,103
that they were that hungry.

859
01:09:39,506 --> 01:09:44,000
They turned it into a moral issue.
They had to.

860
01:09:44,878 --> 01:09:47,438
Because otherwise
they were going to have to take...

861
01:09:47,547 --> 01:09:51,540
long looks at themselves
and might not like what they saw.

862
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:58,758
Play.

863
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:02,958
<i>Baby, let me follow you down</i>

864
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,823
<i>Baby, let me follow you down</i>

865
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:09,824
<i>Well, I'd do anything</i>
<i>in this God almighty world</i>

866
01:10:09,936 --> 01:10:13,303
<i>If you just let me follow you down</i>

867
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:30,817
<i>I'll buy you a diamond ring</i>

868
01:10:31,224 --> 01:10:34,091
<i>Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown</i>

869
01:10:34,661 --> 01:10:38,290
<i>I'll do anything in this God almighty world</i>

870
01:10:38,398 --> 01:10:41,333
<i>If you just let me follow you down</i>

871
01:10:55,482 --> 01:10:58,713
<i>Yes, I'd do anything</i>
<i>in this God almighty world</i>

872
01:10:58,818 --> 01:11:01,651
<i>If you just let me follow you down</i>

873
01:11:04,057 --> 01:11:07,049
To think that entertainers
always have to be happy and funny...

874
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,219
is kind of a shallow thing.

875
01:11:09,329 --> 01:11:13,595
In fact, I've often remembered
one of Bob's quotes is:

876
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:17,033
"Happy? Anybody can be happy.
What's the purpose of that?"

877
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:22,666
The original Mexican name was
<i>La Feria de las Flores...</i>

878
01:11:23,877 --> 01:11:25,674
The Festival of Flowers.

879
01:11:38,057 --> 01:11:41,322
<i>The moment I became acquainted</i>
<i>with old songs...</i>

880
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:44,123
<i>I realized people</i>
<i>were always changing them.</i>

881
01:11:48,201 --> 01:11:53,036
<i>Think of it as an age-old process.</i>
<i>It's been going on for thousands of years.</i>

882
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:57,667
People take old songs,
change them a little...

883
01:11:58,244 --> 01:12:02,704
add to them, adapt them for new people.
It happens in every other field.

884
01:12:02,816 --> 01:12:05,546
Lawyers change old laws to fit new citizens.

885
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:10,813
<i>So I'm one in this long chain</i>
<i>and so are millions of other musicians.</i>

886
01:12:11,257 --> 01:12:14,749
<i>And Woody stepped right in that.</i>
<i>He was always making up verses...</i>

887
01:12:14,861 --> 01:12:17,352
<i>songs about real life,</i>
<i>real people, real events.</i>

888
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:19,761
<i>The idea is that you make up</i>
<i>a song about something real...</i>

889
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,692
<i>don't expect that it'll ever make any money.</i>

890
01:12:22,936 --> 01:12:27,498
It may never be heard by more than a few
dozen people, but who knows? Who knows?

891
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:32,171
And I look upon us all as Woody's children.

892
01:12:32,312 --> 01:12:34,780
<i>Bob Dylan is... Well, you must be</i>
<i>20 years old now, I assume.</i>

893
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:38,044
<i>Yeah, I must be 20.</i>

894
01:12:38,151 --> 01:12:40,449
- <i>Are you?</i>
- <i>Yeah, I'm 20.</i>

895
01:12:40,553 --> 01:12:43,386
<i>Tell me about the songs that</i>
<i>you've written yourself that you sing.</i>

896
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,616
<i>I don't claim to call them</i>
<i>folk songs or anything.</i>

897
01:12:45,725 --> 01:12:47,192
<i>I just call them contemporary songs.</i>

898
01:12:47,293 --> 01:12:49,761
<i>Come you ladies and you gentlemen,</i>
<i>a- listen to my song</i>

899
01:12:49,863 --> 01:12:51,956
<i>Sing it to you right,</i>
<i>but you might think it's wrong</i>

900
01:12:52,065 --> 01:12:53,862
<i>Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell</i>

901
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:56,333
<i>'Bout an East Coast city</i>
<i>that you all know well</i>

902
01:12:56,436 --> 01:12:58,495
<i>It's hard times from the country</i>

903
01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:00,470
<i>Livin' down in New York town</i>

904
01:13:00,573 --> 01:13:03,736
<i>Come you ladies and you gentlemen,</i>
<i>listen to my song</i>

905
01:13:03,843 --> 01:13:06,676
<i>The traditional songs gave us ideas...</i>

906
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:10,408
and attitudes about life
that you could borrow from...

907
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:12,108
that you could build your songs on.

908
01:13:12,218 --> 01:13:15,984
<i>I will not go down under the ground</i>

909
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:21,158
<i>'Cause somebody tells me</i>
<i>that death's comin' round</i>

910
01:13:21,261 --> 01:13:22,956
<i>I wrote them anywhere I was.</i>

911
01:13:23,062 --> 01:13:26,896
You could write them on the subway
or in a café or wherever.

912
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:30,325
You could write them
talking to somebody else...

913
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:33,300
and be scribbling down a song.

914
01:13:33,406 --> 01:13:36,773
<i>Let me die in my footsteps</i>

915
01:13:37,677 --> 01:13:41,306
<i>Before I go down under the ground</i>

916
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:46,476
The first time I think I ever saw him
perform a topical song, he was singing...

917
01:13:46,586 --> 01:13:50,545
"Let me die with my boots on,
before I go under the ground."

918
01:13:50,657 --> 01:13:52,955
And that was a real feeling
in New York at that time.

919
01:13:53,059 --> 01:13:54,822
<i>People were building</i>
<i>bomb shelters everywhere...</i>

920
01:13:54,928 --> 01:13:57,897
<i>and that we'll live out our lives</i>
<i>in preparation for that kind of crap.</i>

921
01:13:57,997 --> 01:14:00,124
<i>And here we were</i>
<i>in the middle of Greenwich Village...</i>

922
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:02,895
like a little pus pimple
in the middle of this huge society...

923
01:14:03,002 --> 01:14:04,799
saying, "This has gotta go.

924
01:14:04,904 --> 01:14:08,169
"We don't... I don't agree with that.
I'm not gonna live my life that way."

925
01:14:16,182 --> 01:14:20,710
<i>No more auction block for me</i>

926
01:14:21,854 --> 01:14:26,018
<i>I was working at CORE</i>
<i>and that was an incredible time.</i>

927
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:28,389
<i>A call would come in,</i>
<i>and people would say, "Oh, my God...</i>

928
01:14:28,494 --> 01:14:31,930
<i>"so-and-so was beaten to a pulp</i>
<i>and so-and-so's in the hospital. "</i>

929
01:14:32,031 --> 01:14:34,795
These were traumatic times to live through.

930
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:38,530
And just the way I felt
was the insane... It was insane.

931
01:14:38,638 --> 01:14:40,799
Why should this be happening?

932
01:14:40,907 --> 01:14:44,866
And I'm sure Bob had that same thing.
You just can't live through this.

933
01:14:44,978 --> 01:14:47,742
You live in your own little world
and your own interests...

934
01:14:47,847 --> 01:14:49,678
but the outer world is definitely part of it.

935
01:14:50,116 --> 01:14:54,348
<i>How many roads must a man walk down</i>

936
01:14:55,355 --> 01:14:58,756
<i>before you call him a man?</i>

937
01:14:59,926 --> 01:15:04,727
<i>Yes, and how many seas</i>
<i>must a white dove sail</i>

938
01:15:05,865 --> 01:15:09,232
<i>before she sleeps in the sand?</i>

939
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:15,203
<i>Yes, and how many times</i>
<i>must the cannonballs fly</i>

940
01:15:16,442 --> 01:15:19,969
<i>before they're forever banned?</i>

941
01:15:21,314 --> 01:15:25,944
<i>The answer, my friend,</i>
<i>is blowin' in the wind</i>

942
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:29,918
<i>The answer is blowin' in the wind</i>

943
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:35,288
<i>I didn't really know if that song</i>
<i>was good or bad or... It felt right.</i>

944
01:15:35,728 --> 01:15:38,720
But I didn't really know...

945
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:42,634
that it had any kind of
anthemic quality or anything.

946
01:15:42,869 --> 01:15:47,397
<i>How many years must a mountain exist</i>

947
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:51,267
<i>before it is washed to the sea?</i>

948
01:15:51,377 --> 01:15:54,005
<i>I wrote the songs to perform the songs.</i>

949
01:15:54,113 --> 01:15:58,049
And I needed to sing, like, in that language.

950
01:16:00,553 --> 01:16:03,044
Which is a language
that I hadn't heard before.

951
01:16:03,156 --> 01:16:07,354
<i>The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the</i>
<i>wind</i>

952
01:16:08,294 --> 01:16:11,957
<i>The answer is blowin' in the wind</i>

953
01:16:16,569 --> 01:16:18,662
<i>How could he write.</i>;

954
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:23,439
"How many roads must a man walk down
before you call him a man?"

955
01:16:23,543 --> 01:16:25,909
This is what my father went through.

956
01:16:26,012 --> 01:16:29,209
He was the one
who wasn't called a man, you know.

957
01:16:30,516 --> 01:16:32,347
So, where is he coming from?

958
01:16:33,653 --> 01:16:35,746
<i>White people don't have hard times.</i>

959
01:16:35,855 --> 01:16:39,347
<i>This was my thinking back then,</i>
<i>because I was a kid, too.</i>

960
01:16:39,592 --> 01:16:42,857
What he was writing was inspirational...

961
01:16:43,296 --> 01:16:45,764
you know, they were inspirational songs.

962
01:16:45,865 --> 01:16:49,892
And they would inspire.
It's the same as gospel.

963
01:16:50,002 --> 01:16:51,526
He was writing truth.

964
01:16:51,871 --> 01:16:54,101
By writing good songs...

965
01:16:54,207 --> 01:16:58,940
and writing about contemporary ideas
in traditional forms, which I understood.

966
01:17:00,046 --> 01:17:02,810
And made it like was written today...

967
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:05,748
but it sounded like it could have been
written 200 years ago, also.

968
01:17:05,852 --> 01:17:08,719
It sounded current and old
at the same time.

969
01:17:09,122 --> 01:17:13,957
So it wasn't just like singing songs
the way Pete Seeger would sing it...

970
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,688
you know, 'cause it's important
that you sing these songs.

971
01:17:16,796 --> 01:17:19,993
He sang songs that affected us.

972
01:17:20,099 --> 01:17:23,899
<i>Well, it ain't no use to sit</i>
<i>and wonder why, babe</i>

973
01:17:25,638 --> 01:17:27,868
<i>lf'n you don't know by now</i>

974
01:17:29,175 --> 01:17:32,941
<i>And it ain't no use to sit</i>
<i>and wonder why, babe</i>

975
01:17:34,614 --> 01:17:37,082
<i>lt'll never do, somehow</i>

976
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:42,115
<i>When your rooster crows</i>
<i>at the break of dawn</i>

977
01:17:43,122 --> 01:17:46,523
<i>Look out your window and I'll be gone</i>

978
01:17:47,293 --> 01:17:50,729
<i>You're the reason I'm travelin' on</i>

979
01:17:51,297 --> 01:17:54,357
<i>But don't think twice, it's all right</i>

980
01:17:59,605 --> 01:18:03,871
Neither one of us had a fixed place to live,
we were both a bit nomadic.

981
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:08,879
So we kind of had
this private little existence, in a way.

982
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:13,819
<i>I am leading a quiet life</i>
<i>on Lower East Broadway</i>

983
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,912
<i>I was an American</i>
<i>I am an American boy</i>

984
01:18:17,023 --> 01:18:21,119
<i>I read</i> The American Boy <i>magazine</i>
<i>and became a Boy Scout in the suburbs</i>

985
01:18:21,227 --> 01:18:25,425
<i>I thought I was Tom Sawyer,</i>
<i>catching crayfish in the Bronx River</i>

986
01:18:25,531 --> 01:18:27,431
<i>and imagining the Mississippi</i>

987
01:18:27,533 --> 01:18:31,094
<i>I had a baseball mitt</i>
<i>and an American Flyer bike</i>

988
01:18:31,204 --> 01:18:32,899
<i>Everything was meshed up at that time.</i>

989
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:36,668
<i>Everything was like just all in like a blender.</i>

990
01:18:36,776 --> 01:18:39,870
<i>Everyone was interested</i>
<i>in whatever was going on.</i>

991
01:18:39,979 --> 01:18:43,176
I stayed at a lot of people's houses
which had poetry books...

992
01:18:43,282 --> 01:18:44,874
and poetry volumes...

993
01:18:44,984 --> 01:18:48,078
and I'd read what I found...

994
01:18:48,487 --> 01:18:51,615
I found Verlaine poems or Rimbaud...

995
01:18:51,724 --> 01:18:53,954
you know, "Drunken Boat," <i>Illuminations.</i>

996
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:57,791
Whether it was these wild and crazy poets
that were getting up on stage...

997
01:18:57,897 --> 01:19:01,594
or whether it was a musician
playing some riff in a jazz club...

998
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:04,727
or some bluegrass guy,
some old roots music...

999
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:09,572
it filters through you, you speak them when
they come out verbally and you play them.

1000
01:19:09,675 --> 01:19:14,237
<i>We were doing things totally instinctively.</i>
<i>It was an instinctive awakening.</i>

1001
01:19:14,513 --> 01:19:17,971
<i>Lightning strikes every once in a while,</i>
<i>in a different place.</i>

1002
01:19:18,484 --> 01:19:19,917
Nobody knows why.

1003
01:19:20,019 --> 01:19:22,385
The night of the Cuban Missile Crisis...

1004
01:19:22,622 --> 01:19:26,752
the general feeling was, the world
was gonna end or something like that.

1005
01:19:26,859 --> 01:19:28,094
<i>I mean, it's quite heavy.</i>

1006
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,924
I walked into The Gaslight
and Bob was there.

1007
01:19:31,964 --> 01:19:33,989
Just a few people listening to him sing.

1008
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,796
He said, "Why don't you come up,
we'll sing some songs together.

1009
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:40,929
<i>"Let's do that old Carter Family song.</i>;
You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone."

1010
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,601
I was playing the nice Carter Family thing,
and we're singing.

1011
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:47,838
And I'm thinking,
"Who's gonna miss us when we're gone?

1012
01:19:47,947 --> 01:19:49,938
"We're all gonna be gone, you know.

1013
01:19:51,484 --> 01:19:52,781
"What the hell is this?"

1014
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:56,953
<i>Oh, where have you been,</i>
<i>my blue-eyed son?</i>

1015
01:19:59,959 --> 01:20:03,690
<i>And where have you been,</i>
<i>my darling young one?</i>

1016
01:20:06,465 --> 01:20:10,663
<i>I've stumbled on the side</i>
<i>of twelve misty mountains.</i>

1017
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:17,369
<i>I've walked and I crawled</i>
<i>on six crooked highways</i>

1018
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:23,779
<i>I've stepped in the middle</i>
<i>of seven sad forests</i>

1019
01:20:26,619 --> 01:20:30,555
<i>I've been out in front</i>
<i>of a dozen dead oceans</i>

1020
01:20:33,192 --> 01:20:37,652
<i>I've been ten thousand miles</i>
<i>in the mouth of a graveyard</i>

1021
01:20:39,732 --> 01:20:43,498
<i>And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard</i>

1022
01:20:45,438 --> 01:20:47,338
<i>it's a hard</i>

1023
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:52,207
<i>It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.</i>

1024
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:58,648
When I got back from India,
and got to the West Coast...

1025
01:20:58,751 --> 01:21:00,878
there was a poet, Charlie Plymell...

1026
01:21:03,089 --> 01:21:05,182
at a party in Bolinas...

1027
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:08,222
played me a record
of this new young folk singer.

1028
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,484
And I heard...

1029
01:21:12,765 --> 01:21:14,665
<i>Hard Rain,</i> I think...

1030
01:21:17,136 --> 01:21:18,364
and wept.

1031
01:21:24,677 --> 01:21:28,807
'Cause it seemed that...

1032
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:33,748
the torch had been passed...

1033
01:21:34,887 --> 01:21:36,650
to another generation.

1034
01:21:36,756 --> 01:21:40,817
From earlier bohemian or beat...

1035
01:21:41,694 --> 01:21:45,027
illumination and self-empowerment.

1036
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:47,266
<i>And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?</i>

1037
01:21:47,266 --> 01:21:51,032
<i>And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?</i>

1038
01:21:51,637 --> 01:21:55,300
<i>And what'll you do now,</i>
<i>my darling young one?</i>

1039
01:21:57,943 --> 01:22:01,936
<i>I'm a-going back out</i>
<i>before the rain starts a-fallin'</i>

1040
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:08,382
<i>And I'll head for</i>
<i>the depths of the deepest dark forest</i>

1041
01:22:10,156 --> 01:22:14,593
<i>Where the people are many</i>
<i>and their hands are all empty</i>

1042
01:22:15,528 --> 01:22:19,965
<i>Where the pellets of poison</i>
<i>are flooding their waters</i>

1043
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:25,261
<i>And I'll tell it, and think it,</i>
<i>and speak it, and breathe it</i>

1044
01:22:27,373 --> 01:22:31,605
<i>And reflect from the mountain</i>
<i>so all souls can see it</i>

1045
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:37,982
<i>Then I'll stand on the ocean</i>
<i>until I start sinkin'</i>

1046
01:22:39,652 --> 01:22:44,021
<i>But I'll know my song well</i>
<i>before I start singin'</i>

1047
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:47,753
<i>And it's a hard, and it's a hard</i>

1048
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:51,261
<i>And it's a hard, and it's a hard</i>

1049
01:22:51,564 --> 01:22:56,433
<i>And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall</i>

1050
01:22:59,271 --> 01:23:02,502
A very famous saying
among the Tibetan Buddhists:

1051
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:08,241
"If the student is not better than
the teacher, then the teacher is a failure."

1052
01:23:09,014 --> 01:23:13,781
And I was really knocked out
by the eloquence.

1053
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,479
Particularly, "I'll know my song well
before I start singing."

1054
01:23:18,824 --> 01:23:20,883
And, "Where all souls shall reflect it."

1055
01:23:20,993 --> 01:23:23,723
Or you know, "Stand on the mountain
where everybody can hear."

1056
01:23:23,829 --> 01:23:25,558
It's sort of this biblical prophecy.

1057
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:30,226
<i>Poetry is words that are empowered</i>
<i>that make your hair stand on end...</i>

1058
01:23:30,469 --> 01:23:35,372
that you recognize instantly
as being some form of subjective truth...

1059
01:23:35,474 --> 01:23:39,604
that has an objective reality to it,
because somebody's realized it.

1060
01:23:40,012 --> 01:23:41,479
Then you call it poetry later.

1061
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,410
<i>Take this one you sang,</i>
<i>this</i> Hard Rain's Gonna Fall.

1062
01:23:46,051 --> 01:23:48,986
<i>Even though it may have come out</i>
<i>of your feelings about atomic rain.</i>

1063
01:23:49,088 --> 01:23:53,457
<i>No, it wasn't atomic rain, no.</i>
<i>Somebody else thought that, too.</i>

1064
01:23:53,626 --> 01:23:55,423
- <i>It's not atomic rain.</i>
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

1065
01:23:55,528 --> 01:23:58,326
- <i>It's just a hard rain. It's not atomic rain.</i>
- <i>Hard rain.</i>

1066
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:02,491
<i>All your songs are about more</i>
<i>than the actual event...</i>

1067
01:24:02,601 --> 01:24:04,330
<i>that may have caused it.</i>

1068
01:24:04,436 --> 01:24:06,631
- <i>You know what I mean?</i>
- <i>I'm not a topical songwriter.</i>

1069
01:24:06,739 --> 01:24:11,472
- <i>So you're not a topical songwriter.</i>
- <i>No, I don't really even like that word.</i>

1070
01:24:11,577 --> 01:24:14,740
<i>I mean, it's not a song</i>
<i>about a certain event.</i>

1071
01:24:14,847 --> 01:24:17,008
- <i>Yeah, it's not, no.</i>
- <i>It's beyond that.</i>

1072
01:24:17,116 --> 01:24:18,811
<i>The folk idiom is so widespread...</i>

1073
01:24:18,918 --> 01:24:21,785
<i>that you could take any part of it</i>
<i>and rework a song.</i>

1074
01:24:21,887 --> 01:24:24,219
I never thought
I was breaking through anything.

1075
01:24:24,323 --> 01:24:27,190
I was just working with an existing form
that was there.

1076
01:24:27,293 --> 01:24:30,694
I was definitely not inventing anything
that hadn't been tried before...

1077
01:24:30,796 --> 01:24:32,923
some part of the picture, you know.

1078
01:24:55,321 --> 01:24:58,381
<i>You must learn to control yourselves.</i>
<i>Is this on?</i>

1079
01:25:00,926 --> 01:25:02,416
<i>Check. Richard?</i>

1080
01:25:05,531 --> 01:25:09,023
Is this mike on? Richard.

1081
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:20,335
<i>You walk into the room</i>

1082
01:25:22,681 --> 01:25:24,740
<i>With your pencil in your hand</i>

1083
01:25:26,218 --> 01:25:28,584
<i>You see somebody naked</i>

1084
01:25:30,322 --> 01:25:32,552
<i>You say, "Who is that, man?"</i>

1085
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:36,986
<i>You try so hard</i>

1086
01:25:39,164 --> 01:25:41,359
<i>But you don't understand</i>

1087
01:25:42,468 --> 01:25:47,132
<i>Just what you'll say when you get home</i>

1088
01:25:49,575 --> 01:25:54,069
<i>Yes, because you know</i>
<i>something is happening here</i>

1089
01:25:54,647 --> 01:25:57,343
<i>But you don't know what it is</i>

1090
01:25:58,917 --> 01:26:00,316
<i>Do you</i>

1091
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,551
<i>Mr. Jones?</i>

1092
01:26:08,227 --> 01:26:10,957
<i>You have many contacts</i>

1093
01:26:12,598 --> 01:26:14,759
<i>Out there among the lumberjacks</i>

1094
01:26:16,135 --> 01:26:17,432
<i>To get you facts</i>

1095
01:26:17,536 --> 01:26:20,972
<i>When someone attacks your imagination</i>

1096
01:26:25,044 --> 01:26:27,638
<i>But nobody has any respect</i>

1097
01:26:29,281 --> 01:26:31,841
<i>Anyway, they just expect</i>

1098
01:26:33,619 --> 01:26:36,019
<i>You to take your check</i>

1099
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:39,113
<i>And give them to tax-deductible</i>

01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:54,765
Don't boo me anymore. Don't boo me.
God, that booing, I can't stand it.

1102
01:26:55,207 --> 01:26:57,869
Oh, my God.
It's hard to get in tune when they're booing.

1103
01:26:57,976 --> 01:27:00,342
Yeah, I can't get in tune at all
when they're booing.

1104
01:27:00,446 --> 01:27:04,906
I can't hear anything.
I don't even want to get in tune.

1105
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:11,085
When they yell
in this weird nasal tone from here.

1106
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:16,887
Jesus, you know, I don't understand
how can they buy the tickets up so fast.

1107
01:27:18,297 --> 01:27:21,266
- I mean, you know. Let's get that light off.
- Turn the light off.

01:27:56,368 --> 01:28:00,361
<i>But I would not feel so all alone</i>

1116
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:05,304
<i>Everybody must get stoned</i>

1117
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:07,810
Dylan's first albums did not sell.

1118
01:28:09,314 --> 01:28:13,080
<i>I don't think we sold an album per store</i>
<i>in America. I think, 2,500.</i>

1119
01:28:13,185 --> 01:28:16,052
<i>Salespeople, you know, would say,</i>
<i>"This is Hammond's folly."</i>

1120
01:28:16,155 --> 01:28:19,682
<i>Since he cost so little to record,</i>
<i>let John have his folly.</i>

1121
01:28:21,026 --> 01:28:23,927
<i>On my second album, all of a sudden</i>
<i>people started to take notice...</i>

1122
01:28:24,029 --> 01:28:25,360
<i>that never noticed before.</i>

1123
01:28:25,464 --> 01:28:27,091
Grossman came into the picture
around there.

1124
01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:30,065
<i>He was kind of like</i>
<i>a Col. Tom Parker figure...</i>

1125
01:28:30,169 --> 01:28:33,263
<i>all immaculately dressed,</i>
<i>every time you see him.</i>

1126
01:28:33,372 --> 01:28:34,634
<i>You could smell him coming.</i>

1127
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:37,868
Al Grossman was
the first successful folk manager...

1128
01:28:37,976 --> 01:28:40,376
who knew how to make money
out of his singers.

1129
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:42,413
<i>He would own the recording studio...</i>

1130
01:28:42,514 --> 01:28:45,608
<i>he would own the music publishing</i>
<i>company, he would own Bob Dylan.</i>

1131
01:28:45,717 --> 01:28:47,150
<i>He would own Peter, Paul and Mary.</i>

1132
01:28:47,252 --> 01:28:50,050
He would sell a Bob Dylan song
to Peter, Paul and Mary...

1133
01:28:50,155 --> 01:28:54,057
who would sing on a recording in his studio,
which he was getting the rights.

1134
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:57,026
So he would get a salami...
He had a salami technique going.

1135
01:28:57,129 --> 01:29:00,257
He would get a piece of the action
from six or seven different directions.

1136
01:29:00,699 --> 01:29:02,997
<i>He created Peter, Paul and Mary...</i>

1137
01:29:03,101 --> 01:29:08,004
<i>because he saw people really wanted</i>
<i>a fresh, young group like this...</i>

1138
01:29:08,106 --> 01:29:09,539
<i>that they could relate to.</i>

1139
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:13,543
He changed Paul's name to Paul, from Noel.

1140
01:29:14,112 --> 01:29:17,411
So it would have that biblical inference.
He was a genius.

1141
01:29:17,983 --> 01:29:20,110
<i>I knew Mary Travers, you know,</i>
<i>of Peter, Paul and Mary.</i>

1142
01:29:20,219 --> 01:29:23,746
<i>I had known her when she was younger.</i>
<i>She used to sing in Washington Square Park.</i>

1143
01:29:23,856 --> 01:29:26,825
<i>And she was a nice person</i>
<i>and very lively teenager.</i>

1144
01:29:26,925 --> 01:29:29,120
One time, in the middle of winter...

1145
01:29:29,228 --> 01:29:32,527
and it was cold on MacDougal Street,
you know, like February...

1146
01:29:34,066 --> 01:29:37,092
I saw her, and I says,
"Where have you been, Mary?"

1147
01:29:37,202 --> 01:29:39,932
She says, "Well, I've been in Florida
for the last couple of..."

1148
01:29:40,038 --> 01:29:41,801
I don't know if it was weeks or months.

1149
01:29:41,907 --> 01:29:45,343
"A man named Albert Grossman
has put me together...

1150
01:29:45,444 --> 01:29:47,344
"with some other guys
from the coffeehouses...

1151
01:29:47,446 --> 01:29:50,347
"and we're trying out a new group there.

1152
01:29:50,449 --> 01:29:51,746
"We're singing."

1153
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:55,752
And I said, "You mean
you were in Florida all this time?

1154
01:29:55,854 --> 01:29:58,288
"Where's your tan?
Didn't you ever go out in the sun?"

1155
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,824
She says, "No, Albert told me
I shouldn't go out in the sun.

1156
01:30:00,926 --> 01:30:03,952
"That I was supposed to be
the pale, blonde, indoor type."

1157
01:30:04,062 --> 01:30:07,589
And it really made my flesh creep,
to put it truthfully...

1158
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:11,362
because I was shivering cold in New York...

1159
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:13,495
and she had the chance
to get out in the sun...

1160
01:30:13,605 --> 01:30:17,006
but that she was being manipulated,
that the whole thing had an image...

1161
01:30:17,109 --> 01:30:18,804
it had a look.

1162
01:30:18,911 --> 01:30:21,846
I just felt that this was a bad sign.

1163
01:30:21,947 --> 01:30:24,074
<i>I didn't feel that Albert manipulated Bob...</i>

1164
01:30:24,182 --> 01:30:27,379
<i>because I think Bob</i>
<i>was weirder than Albert...</i>

1165
01:30:27,486 --> 01:30:29,386
<i>so that he couldn't manipulate him.</i>

1166
01:30:29,488 --> 01:30:33,390
And by weird, I don't mean in a bad way
but I mean that he had enough games.

1167
01:30:33,492 --> 01:30:37,292
Now, Bob was also a terrific opportunist...

1168
01:30:37,396 --> 01:30:41,332
so if someone gave him an opportunity
to do something, he could use it.

1169
01:30:41,433 --> 01:30:43,230
I don't know if Bob was a hustler.

1170
01:30:43,335 --> 01:30:45,929
I think he just knew what he wanted
and he could focus.

1171
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:47,830
<i>He was very astute.</i>

1172
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:52,468
He could pick out somebody who was
important. I mean, any musician would...

1173
01:30:52,945 --> 01:30:54,412
but he was really good at it.

1174
01:30:54,813 --> 01:30:58,909
<i>Albert tells me one day he's gonna send</i>
<i>a guy over to see me named Bob Dylan.</i>

1175
01:31:00,686 --> 01:31:03,814
He's got a guitar, with some kind
of a contraption around his neck...

1176
01:31:03,922 --> 01:31:06,447
so that the harmonica is up to his mouth.

1177
01:31:06,558 --> 01:31:08,389
Now, believe me when I tell you...

1178
01:31:08,493 --> 01:31:12,088
nobody had ever seen this
on Broadway before.

1179
01:31:12,197 --> 01:31:14,392
And he starts singing for me.

1180
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:19,732
And one of the things that I pride myself on
is that I think I'm one of the few...

1181
01:31:19,838 --> 01:31:23,365
At that time, I may have been
the only one in the music business...

1182
01:31:23,475 --> 01:31:25,466
who listened to the words.

1183
01:31:26,311 --> 01:31:27,471
And when I heard...

1184
01:31:27,579 --> 01:31:32,175
"How many years must one man have
before he can hear people cry," I flipped.

1185
01:31:32,384 --> 01:31:35,444
I can't even remember what the songs were
that he played me that day...

1186
01:31:35,554 --> 01:31:37,579
but I said, "Okay, that's it. I want you."

1187
01:31:37,756 --> 01:31:42,693
<i>How many roads must a man walk down</i>

1188
01:31:43,762 --> 01:31:47,721
<i>Before they call him a man</i>

1189
01:31:53,605 --> 01:31:57,336
<i>The music business per se</i>
<i>was dominated by music publishers.</i>

1190
01:31:59,344 --> 01:32:02,836
In those days, the song was important.
You would pick a song and work on it.

1191
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:14,518
<i>Historically, whenever you see</i>
<i>Dylan mentioned in print...</i>

1192
01:32:14,626 --> 01:32:18,153
<i>it's always John Hammond</i>
<i>who discovered Bob Dylan.</i>

1193
01:32:18,263 --> 01:32:21,699
I think the guy
who made Dylan popular was me...

1194
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,427
if I say so myself.

1195
01:32:23,535 --> 01:32:26,527
I'm the one who started
to get his songs all over the place.

1196
01:32:26,638 --> 01:32:29,198
<i>We never had resistance</i>
<i>within the company to him.</i>

1197
01:32:29,307 --> 01:32:32,765
My boss, the old man, Herman Starr,
got on it right away.

1198
01:32:32,878 --> 01:32:35,369
Why? Because they smelled dollars,
that's why.

1199
01:32:37,182 --> 01:32:39,241
<i>I gotta sing you something</i>
<i>to tell you something.</i>

1200
01:32:39,351 --> 01:32:42,218
<i>It's called</i> Masters of War.

1201
01:32:46,792 --> 01:32:49,090
<i>Come you masters of war</i>

1202
01:32:50,896 --> 01:32:53,194
<i>You that build the big guns</i>

1203
01:32:54,966 --> 01:32:57,457
<i>You that build the death planes</i>

1204
01:32:59,337 --> 01:33:01,464
<i>You that build all the bombs</i>

1205
01:33:03,508 --> 01:33:05,669
<i>You that hide behind walls</i>

1206
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:09,537
<i>You that hide behind desks</i>

1207
01:33:11,316 --> 01:33:15,047
<i>I just want you to know</i>
<i>I can see through your masks</i>

1208
01:33:17,622 --> 01:33:20,682
<i>And I hope that you die</i>

1209
01:33:21,326 --> 01:33:23,453
<i>And your death will come soon</i>

1210
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:27,628
<i>I'll follow your casket</i>

1211
01:33:29,234 --> 01:33:31,566
<i>All the pale afternoon</i>

1212
01:33:33,572 --> 01:33:35,938
<i>And I'll watch while you're lowered</i>

1213
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:39,707
<i>Down to your deathbed</i>

1214
01:33:41,546 --> 01:33:46,415
<i>And I'll stand over your grave</i>
<i>till I'm sure that you're dead</i>

1215
01:33:46,518 --> 01:33:50,648
<i>I did a concert of his in Town Hall.</i>
<i>It might have been '63.</i>

1216
01:33:51,056 --> 01:33:53,388
And when the concert was over...

1217
01:33:54,126 --> 01:33:56,526
Bob called me over and he said:

1218
01:33:57,496 --> 01:34:00,397
"Is anybody in the stage door
waiting for me?"

1219
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:06,332
<i>The fact is that I do not blame</i>
<i>any artist for seeking fame...</i>

1220
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:08,929
<i>which is in a sense, recognition.</i>

1221
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,440
You want to know
that you've pleased an audience...

1222
01:34:11,543 --> 01:34:14,273
you want to know that
the audience is interested in you.

1223
01:34:14,813 --> 01:34:18,579
<i>He was, in his way, a dynamic performer.</i>

1224
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:22,909
But I think mostly the material
that he was doing was so great...

1225
01:34:24,389 --> 01:34:26,186
that everybody responded to it.

1226
01:34:27,926 --> 01:34:31,020
<i>Oxford Town, Oxford Town</i>
<i>Everybody's got their heads bowed down</i>

1227
01:34:31,129 --> 01:34:33,256
<i>The sun don't shine above the ground</i>

1228
01:34:33,365 --> 01:34:35,856
<i>Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford Town</i>

1229
01:34:35,967 --> 01:34:39,596
<i>The topical song movement</i>
<i>was a product of the Left.</i>

1230
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:47,401
<i>And the Left, at that time,</i>
<i>would have been Pete Seeger...</i>

1231
01:34:47,512 --> 01:34:49,480
<i>and the Weavers, and Woody Guthrie.</i>

1232
01:34:49,581 --> 01:34:53,984
These people created material
based on topical situations.

1233
01:34:57,856 --> 01:35:00,689
<i>Pete Seeger, very tall, like a towering figure.</i>

1234
01:35:00,992 --> 01:35:02,653
I didn't realize he was a communist.

1235
01:35:02,761 --> 01:35:05,821
I really wasn't sure even
what a communist was.

1236
01:35:10,035 --> 01:35:13,664
If he was, it wouldn't have
mattered to me anyway.

1237
01:35:16,074 --> 01:35:18,634
I really didn't think about people
in those terms.

1238
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:21,510
Bobby was not really a political person.

1239
01:35:23,215 --> 01:35:25,706
He was thought of...

1240
01:35:26,785 --> 01:35:28,116
as being...

1241
01:35:30,121 --> 01:35:33,022
a political person and a man of the Left.

1242
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:38,189
And in a general sort of way, yes, he was.
But he was not interested...

1243
01:35:39,097 --> 01:35:42,863
in the true nature of the Soviet Union
or any of that crap.

1244
01:35:44,269 --> 01:35:46,794
We thought he was hopelessly
politically naive.

1245
01:35:46,905 --> 01:35:51,365
But in retrospect, I think he may have been
more sophisticated than we were.

1246
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:06,684
<i>The folk music revival was postponed</i>
<i>by almost 10 years by the witch hunt.</i>

1247
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:11,023
<i>I mean, when US Army publishes</i>
<i>pamphlets on how to spot a communist...</i>

1248
01:36:11,129 --> 01:36:14,758
<i>that have lines in them like,</i>
<i>"He will sometimes play the guitar"...</i>

1249
01:36:14,866 --> 01:36:17,596
that kind of thing had a very...

1250
01:36:19,037 --> 01:36:21,505
repressive and suppressive effect.

1251
01:36:31,149 --> 01:36:35,108
<i>The song</i> Goodnight Irene
<i>was all over the country.</i>

1252
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:36,653
<i>You couldn't escape that song...</i>

1253
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:39,849
<i>in the United States of America,</i>
<i>in the summer of 1950.</i>

1254
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:44,292
<i>Right then, the very moment that</i> Irene
<i>was at the top of the Top 40...</i>

1255
01:36:44,396 --> 01:36:46,921
a bunch of blacklisters
probably said to themselves:

1256
01:36:47,032 --> 01:36:50,559
"How did we let these commie
so-and-so's slip through our fingers?"

1257
01:36:50,969 --> 01:36:54,837
<i>They started out to see that we were</i>
<i>blacklisted, and about two years later...</i>

1258
01:36:54,939 --> 01:36:58,136
instead of singing in the Waldorf-Astoria,
or Ciro's in Hollywood...

1259
01:36:59,577 --> 01:37:02,876
we were singing in Daffy's Bar and Grill
on the outskirts of Cleveland...

1260
01:37:02,981 --> 01:37:05,779
and decided to take a sabbatical.

1261
01:37:06,451 --> 01:37:08,681
Lee says, it turned
into a Mond-ical and a Tuesd-ical.

1262
01:37:10,188 --> 01:37:12,986
<i>By the time McCarthy,</i>
<i>I think, started to wane...</i>

1263
01:37:13,091 --> 01:37:15,491
the folk music thing started to come up.

1264
01:37:16,761 --> 01:37:20,356
<i>I say it's in the interest of every human</i>
<i>being in the United States of America...</i>

1265
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:23,229
<i>to get some good senators</i>
<i>out of Mississippi for a change.</i>

1266
01:37:23,335 --> 01:37:25,735
<i>And you can do it,</i>
<i>and you will do it soon, I know.</i>

1267
01:37:56,368 --> 01:37:59,269
<i>I got him to go with</i>
<i>Pete and Theodore Bikel...</i>

1268
01:37:59,371 --> 01:38:01,498
as they were both going down to the South.

1269
01:38:01,606 --> 01:38:01,873
<i>The day Medgar Evers</i>
<i>was buried from the bullet he caught</i>

1270
01:38:01,873 --> 01:38:06,401
<i>The day Medgar Evers</i>
<i>was buried from the bullet he caught</i>

1271
01:38:07,312 --> 01:38:12,079
<i>And I encouraged him to go with them</i>
<i>and he did, as part of an education.</i>

1272
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:15,747
The Civil Rights Movement
was in full swing...

1273
01:38:16,154 --> 01:38:18,520
<i>and there was a big field</i>
<i>outside Greenwood...</i>

1274
01:38:18,623 --> 01:38:20,250
<i>with several hundred people.</i>

1275
01:38:20,658 --> 01:38:24,958
<i>I heard some speechifying there</i>
<i>that I'll never forget in all my life.</i>

1276
01:38:25,063 --> 01:38:29,762
And I remember Bob singing a song
which really caused people to think.

1277
01:38:30,268 --> 01:38:32,361
<i>He's Only a Pawn in The Game.</i>

1278
01:38:33,605 --> 01:38:36,631
He was singing about the man
who killed Medgar Evers.

1279
01:38:37,175 --> 01:38:40,906
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>don't just think of this one man...</i>

1280
01:38:41,012 --> 01:38:44,413
<i>who did this murder,</i>
<i>but think of the whole situation.</i>

1281
01:38:44,883 --> 01:38:47,443
To be on the side of people
who are struggling for something...

1282
01:38:47,552 --> 01:38:50,112
doesn't necessarily mean
you are being political.

1283
01:38:50,255 --> 01:38:53,782
<i>Oh, my name it ain't nothin'</i>

1284
01:38:54,092 --> 01:38:56,560
<i>My age it means less</i>

1285
01:38:57,562 --> 01:39:01,089
<i>The country I come from</i>

1286
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,565
<i>Is called the Midwest</i>

1287
01:39:04,402 --> 01:39:08,168
<i>I was taught and brought up there</i>

1288
01:39:08,273 --> 01:39:10,571
<i>The laws to abide</i>

1289
01:39:11,643 --> 01:39:15,044
<i>And that the land that I live in</i>

1290
01:39:15,146 --> 01:39:17,580
<i>Has God on its side</i>

1291
01:39:18,216 --> 01:39:21,242
<i>I would say that Bob was gifted,</i>
<i>and it was flowering.</i>

1292
01:39:21,352 --> 01:39:24,719
<i>He had a great desire to change the world.</i>

1293
01:39:24,823 --> 01:39:26,757
We even talked about it.

1294
01:39:26,858 --> 01:39:29,019
We thought that segregation
wasn't gonna last...

1295
01:39:29,127 --> 01:39:31,527
<i>and that we were gonna have</i>
<i>something to do with ending it.</i>

1296
01:39:31,629 --> 01:39:33,426
<i>We really believed</i>
<i>we were gonna have a part...</i>

1297
01:39:33,531 --> 01:39:36,056
<i>as songwriters in changing the world.</i>

1298
01:39:54,552 --> 01:39:58,852
<i>I had first laid eyes on Bob in Gerde's Folk</i>
<i>City.</i>

1299
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:00,487
<i>I had been told about him.</i>

1300
01:40:00,892 --> 01:40:04,953
"This guy's a genius
and he writes these incredible songs...

1301
01:40:05,063 --> 01:40:08,521
"and he admires Woody Guthrie,"
and all this stuff.

1302
01:40:08,633 --> 01:40:10,999
I was very dubious, you know...

1303
01:40:11,102 --> 01:40:14,435
when people raved
about somebody other than myself.

1304
01:40:14,539 --> 01:40:16,507
But I went, and sure enough...

1305
01:40:16,608 --> 01:40:18,599
he was everything
that they had said he was.

1306
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:22,373
<i>We both had our baby fat. That's what</i>
<i>I think of when I look at the early pictures.</i>

1307
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,347
Smooth skin, baby fat.
We were really young.

1308
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,445
<i>Bob looked like a ragamuffin.</i>

1309
01:40:27,552 --> 01:40:30,146
<i>Probably one of the things</i>
<i>I found so appealing about him.</i>

1310
01:40:30,255 --> 01:40:31,882
<i>He would bring out the mother instinct...</i>

1311
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:34,720
in a woman who thought
her mother instinct was dead.

1312
01:40:35,193 --> 01:40:39,857
<i>He came out and stayed with me</i>
<i>in a beautiful house, in Carmel Valley.</i>

1313
01:40:40,265 --> 01:40:41,493
<i>Bob liked to write there.</i>

1314
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:44,591
<i>And he would just stand,</i>
<i>tapping away at that typewriter.</i>

1315
01:40:44,702 --> 01:40:47,569
<i>He would always say,</i>
<i>"What do you think of this?"</i>

1316
01:40:47,672 --> 01:40:51,233
And I wouldn't understand the thing at all,
but I loved it.

1317
01:40:52,777 --> 01:40:55,837
So I went, "Okay, I'm gonna figure
this one out." So I read through it.

1318
01:40:55,947 --> 01:40:59,906
And I gave back my interpretation
of what I thought it was about.

1319
01:41:00,018 --> 01:41:01,645
He said, "That's pretty fucking good."

1320
01:41:01,753 --> 01:41:03,687
He would say, "See now,
a bunch of years from now...

1321
01:41:03,788 --> 01:41:05,187
"all these people, all these assholes...

1322
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:07,053
"are gonna be writing
about all the shit I write.

1323
01:41:07,158 --> 01:41:10,889
"I don't know where the fuck it comes from.
I don't know what the fuck it's about.

1324
01:41:10,995 --> 01:41:13,463
"And they're gonna write what it's about."

1325
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:15,496
<i>Oh, the time will come up</i>

1326
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,761
<i>When the winds will stop</i>

1327
01:41:17,869 --> 01:41:21,168
<i>And the breeze will cease to be breathin'</i>

1328
01:41:22,173 --> 01:41:24,232
<i>Like the stillness in the wind</i>

1329
01:41:24,342 --> 01:41:26,469
<i>Before the hurricane begins</i>

1330
01:41:26,578 --> 01:41:29,479
<i>The hour that the ship comes in</i>

1331
01:41:30,648 --> 01:41:32,673
<i>And the sea will split</i>

1332
01:41:32,784 --> 01:41:34,775
<i>And the ships will hit</i>

1333
01:41:34,886 --> 01:41:38,253
<i>And the sands on the shoreline</i>
<i>will be shaking</i>

1334
01:41:38,356 --> 01:41:40,824
<i>Bob would write.</i>
<i>Just write and write and write.</i>

1335
01:41:40,925 --> 01:41:43,689
<i>And one time, we pulled into someplace...</i>

1336
01:41:43,795 --> 01:41:47,196
and I was okay by then.
Bare feet or not, I was famous.

1337
01:41:48,099 --> 01:41:50,329
But this scruffy-looking guy I had with me...

1338
01:41:50,435 --> 01:41:52,733
and the people behind the desk
were having none of it...

1339
01:41:52,837 --> 01:41:55,431
and they said they didn't have a room.

1340
01:41:56,207 --> 01:41:58,175
And now, of course, I was livid...

1341
01:41:58,276 --> 01:42:01,734
and pulled all my punches,
and got him a room.

1342
01:42:03,514 --> 01:42:07,382
And he wrote a song
that just was devastating:

1343
01:42:07,485 --> 01:42:09,214
<i>The Hour The Ship Comes In.</i>

1344
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:10,981
And I could see him hanging them all.

1345
01:42:11,089 --> 01:42:15,219
He'd never sort of fess up to that sort of
thing, but that's what it seemed like to me.

1346
01:42:15,326 --> 01:42:17,920
Working out whatever feelings...

1347
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:22,156
he might have had
about not being given a room...

1348
01:42:22,266 --> 01:42:24,666
in a brilliant song, in one night.

1349
01:42:24,769 --> 01:42:26,930
<i>And they'll raise their hands</i>

1350
01:42:27,038 --> 01:42:28,972
<i>Sayin' we'll meet all your demands</i>

1351
01:42:29,073 --> 01:42:32,509
<i>There'll be a shout from the bow,</i>
<i>"Your days are numbered"</i>

1352
01:42:33,244 --> 01:42:35,303
<i>And like Pharaoh's tribe</i>

1353
01:42:35,413 --> 01:42:37,210
<i>They'll be drownded in the tide</i>

1354
01:42:37,315 --> 01:42:42,014
<i>And like Goliath, they'll be conquered</i>

1355
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:00,938
<i>You had country folks and city folks there.</i>

1356
01:43:01,039 --> 01:43:03,940
<i>We purposely tried to mix it up at Newport.</i>

1357
01:43:29,567 --> 01:43:31,057
<i>There was Johnny Cash.</i>

1358
01:43:35,239 --> 01:43:38,731
And then you had O.J. Abbott
singing some of the ballads he knew...

1359
01:43:38,843 --> 01:43:41,607
as a young man working
in the lumber camps.

1360
01:43:41,713 --> 01:43:42,907
Right side by side.

1361
01:43:53,157 --> 01:43:57,150
There were 15,000 people,
and that seemed to me just immense.

1362
01:43:57,628 --> 01:44:02,292
Everyone was there who played folk music.
Old and new.

1363
01:44:02,734 --> 01:44:04,497
Sort of younger people, too.

1364
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:15,145
We kind of bonded in a way,
music-wise, you know...

1365
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:17,675
what we were singing
and what he was writing.

1366
01:44:18,015 --> 01:44:21,917
<i>A bullet from the back of a bush</i>

1367
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,784
<i>Took Medgar Evers's blood</i>

1368
01:44:26,991 --> 01:44:30,825
<i>A finger fired the trigger to his name</i>

1369
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:37,230
<i>A handle hid out in the dark</i>

1370
01:44:37,335 --> 01:44:39,394
<i>The hand set the spark</i>

1371
01:44:39,504 --> 01:44:41,529
<i>Two eyes took the aim</i>

1372
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:45,138
<i>Behind a man's brain</i>

1373
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:48,337
<i>But he can't be blamed</i>

1374
01:44:49,547 --> 01:44:53,916
<i>He's only a pawn in their game</i>

1375
01:44:55,086 --> 01:44:58,317
<i>I was the only singer there probably</i>
<i>singing the songs that he'd written.</i>

1376
01:44:58,422 --> 01:45:00,856
<i>And most likely, two years earlier to that...</i>

1377
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:03,859
<i>I wouldn't have been able</i>
<i>to get into Newport.</i>

1378
01:45:04,295 --> 01:45:07,924
<i>You got more than the blacks,</i>
<i>don't complain</i>

1379
01:45:08,933 --> 01:45:10,764
<i>You're better than them</i>

1380
01:45:10,868 --> 01:45:14,463
<i>You been born with white skin, they explain</i>

1381
01:45:15,239 --> 01:45:17,207
<i>It was quite a sensation.</i>

1382
01:45:18,276 --> 01:45:21,404
He was singing a lot of,
what they called then, protest songs.

1383
01:45:21,512 --> 01:45:24,538
I've always hated that designation.

1384
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:28,781
And it was very much...

1385
01:45:29,854 --> 01:45:31,344
in the spirit of the time.

1386
01:45:31,923 --> 01:45:35,188
<i>Pete and the crowd</i>
<i>around</i> Broadside <i>magazine...</i>

1387
01:45:35,293 --> 01:45:37,727
<i>had fallen head over heels in love with him.</i>

1388
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:42,528
<i>Today, Medgar Evers was buried</i>
<i>from the bullet he caught</i>

1389
01:45:46,537 --> 01:45:50,029
<i>They lowered him down as a king</i>

1390
01:45:52,944 --> 01:45:57,574
<i>But when the shadowy sun sets on the one</i>

1391
01:45:57,682 --> 01:45:59,741
<i>That fired the gun</i>

1392
01:45:59,851 --> 01:46:02,081
<i>He'll see by his grave</i>

1393
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,418
<i>On the stone that remains</i>

1394
01:46:05,523 --> 01:46:07,753
<i>Carved next to his name</i>

1395
01:46:07,859 --> 01:46:10,225
<i>His epitaph plain</i>

1396
01:46:10,661 --> 01:46:15,428
<i>Only a pawn in their game</i>

1397
01:46:17,635 --> 01:46:20,502
<i>There was Woody Guthrie,</i>
<i>transition to Pete Seeger...</i>

1398
01:46:20,605 --> 01:46:22,800
<i>who carried on Woody's tradition.</i>

1399
01:46:22,907 --> 01:46:25,967
Now who was to carry on from Pete Seeger?

1400
01:46:26,911 --> 01:46:29,675
And in that spot really, came Bob Dylan.

1401
01:46:29,981 --> 01:46:33,314
<i>So we began to recognize that Bobby...</i>

1402
01:46:33,417 --> 01:46:36,909
<i>would be the continuation in that tradition.</i>

1403
01:46:37,021 --> 01:46:39,751
<i>I wrote this song. It tells a story...</i>

1404
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,889
<i>if you like stories.</i>

1405
01:47:01,445 --> 01:47:04,812
- Maybe it doesn't do anything.
- Maybe it doesn't tell a story.

1406
01:47:06,751 --> 01:47:09,584
<i>It was a very, very exciting... I felt...</i>

1407
01:47:10,454 --> 01:47:12,149
<i>it was like, Bob was my pal.</i>

1408
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:16,022
We were involved in the same thing. And
I knew he was gonna be a massive star...

1409
01:47:16,127 --> 01:47:17,719
and I liked that.

1410
01:47:29,807 --> 01:47:30,865
Let me say something?

1411
01:47:31,242 --> 01:47:34,609
<i>We just have to sing one, that's all.</i>
<i>That's the introduction.</i>

1412
01:47:37,848 --> 01:47:42,478
<i>Oh my name it is nothin'</i>

1413
01:47:43,254 --> 01:47:47,623
<i>My age it means less</i>

1414
01:47:48,225 --> 01:47:53,128
<i>The country I come from</i>

1415
01:47:53,364 --> 01:47:57,528
<i>Is called the Midwest</i>

1416
01:47:57,868 --> 01:48:02,771
<i>I was taught and brought up there</i>

1417
01:48:03,007 --> 01:48:07,376
<i>The laws to abide</i>

1418
01:48:07,478 --> 01:48:12,415
<i>And that the land that I live in</i>

1419
01:48:12,516 --> 01:48:17,317
<i>Has God on its side</i>

1420
01:48:18,856 --> 01:48:23,816
<i>Oh the history books tell it</i>

1421
01:48:23,928 --> 01:48:27,659
<i>They tell it so well</i>

1422
01:48:28,065 --> 01:48:32,968
<i>The cavalries charged</i>

1423
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:37,564
<i>And the Indians fell</i>

1424
01:48:37,675 --> 01:48:42,271
<i>The cavalries charged</i>

1425
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:46,908
<i>And the Indians died</i>

1426
01:48:47,018 --> 01:48:51,250
<i>Oh the country was young</i>

1427
01:48:51,722 --> 01:48:56,056
<i>With God on its side</i>

1428
01:48:57,828 --> 01:49:00,092
<i>I wrote a lot of songs</i>
<i>in a quick amount of time.</i>

1429
01:49:00,197 --> 01:49:01,789
<i>I could do that then...</i>

1430
01:49:02,033 --> 01:49:06,766
because the process was new to me.

1431
01:49:08,272 --> 01:49:09,899
I felt like...

1432
01:49:10,508 --> 01:49:14,171
I'd discovered something
no one else had ever discovered...

1433
01:49:14,845 --> 01:49:19,441
and I was in a sort of an arena artistically
that no one else had ever been in before...

1434
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:22,383
ever, although I might
have been wrong about that.

1435
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:25,450
<i>One time ago a crazy dream came to me</i>

1436
01:49:25,556 --> 01:49:28,116
<i>I dreamt I was walkin' in World War Three</i>

1437
01:49:28,759 --> 01:49:31,159
<i>I went to the doctor the very next day</i>

1438
01:49:31,262 --> 01:49:33,127
<i>To see what kind of words he had to say</i>

1439
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:34,925
<i>He said it was a bad dream</i>

1440
01:49:40,571 --> 01:49:45,235
<i>I was on top of this 12-foot station</i>
<i>and I had a long lens.</i>

1441
01:49:45,342 --> 01:49:47,867
I was looking at Bob Dylan
coming out on stage.

1442
01:49:47,978 --> 01:49:50,412
<i>Well, down the corner by the hot-dog stand</i>

1443
01:49:50,514 --> 01:49:51,845
<i>I seen another man</i>

1444
01:49:51,949 --> 01:49:53,041
<i>I said, "Howdy, friend</i>

1445
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:54,981
<i>"I guess there's just us two"</i>

1446
01:49:55,086 --> 01:49:57,646
<i>He screamed, and down the road he flew</i>

1447
01:49:58,289 --> 01:49:59,984
<i>Thought I was a communist</i>

1448
01:50:02,927 --> 01:50:06,761
<i>He was Charlie Chaplin.</i>
<i>He was Dylan Thomas.</i>

1449
01:50:07,264 --> 01:50:10,825
<i>He talked like Woody Guthrie.</i>
<i>He was constantly moving.</i>

1450
01:50:12,236 --> 01:50:15,364
<i>More time passed and now it seems</i>

1451
01:50:15,473 --> 01:50:17,634
<i>Everybody's having them dreams</i>

1452
01:50:17,741 --> 01:50:22,371
<i>Everybody sees theyself</i>
<i>walkin' around with nobody else</i>

1453
01:50:24,115 --> 01:50:27,744
<i>And all the people can be</i>
<i>half right some of the time</i>

1454
01:50:29,286 --> 01:50:32,221
<i>Some of the people can be</i>
<i>all right part of the time</i>

1455
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:35,825
<i>But all the people can't be</i>
<i>all right all of the time</i>

1456
01:50:36,861 --> 01:50:38,658
<i>Abraham Lincoln said that</i>

1457
01:50:39,864 --> 01:50:42,526
<i>I'll let you be in my dream</i>
<i>if I can be in yours</i>

1458
01:50:42,633 --> 01:50:43,930
<i>I said that</i>

1459
01:50:45,402 --> 01:50:49,702
<i>In old Irish mythology,</i>
<i>they talk about the shape-changers.</i>

1460
01:50:50,207 --> 01:50:53,540
<i>He changed voices. He changed images.</i>

1461
01:50:54,378 --> 01:50:58,405
It wasn't necessary for him to be...

1462
01:50:58,516 --> 01:51:00,507
a definitive person.

1463
01:51:01,252 --> 01:51:03,049
He was a receiver.

1464
01:51:04,121 --> 01:51:06,021
He was possessed.

1465
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:09,991
And he articulated...

1466
01:51:11,395 --> 01:51:14,990
what the rest of us wanted to say
but couldn't say.

1467
01:51:15,266 --> 01:51:15,366
<i>How many roads must a man walk down</i>

1468
01:51:15,366 --> 01:51:20,030
<i>How many roads must a man walk down</i>

1469
01:51:22,173 --> 01:51:26,701
<i>before you call him a man?</i>

1470
01:51:28,913 --> 01:51:33,646
<i>How many seas must a white dove sail</i>

1471
01:51:35,953 --> 01:51:40,583
<i>before she sleeps in the sand?</i>

1472
01:51:41,358 --> 01:51:43,724
<i>It's almost enough to make you...</i>

1473
01:51:43,827 --> 01:51:47,786
<i>believe in Jung's notion</i>
<i>of collective unconscious.</i>

1474
01:51:48,966 --> 01:51:52,060
<i>That if there is an American</i>
<i>collective unconscious...</i>

1475
01:51:52,169 --> 01:51:54,694
<i>if you could believe in something like that...</i>

1476
01:51:54,805 --> 01:51:57,239
that Bobby had somehow tapped into it.

1477
01:51:58,442 --> 01:52:00,637
And there were always...

1478
01:52:02,346 --> 01:52:04,940
these sometimes very faint resonances.

1479
01:52:10,187 --> 01:52:12,382
<i>In taking all the elements</i>
<i>that I've ever known...</i>

1480
01:52:12,489 --> 01:52:16,084
<i>to make wide-sweeping statements</i>
<i>which conveyed a feeling...</i>

1481
01:52:16,193 --> 01:52:19,594
<i>that was in the general essence</i>
<i>of the spirit of the times.</i>

1482
01:52:21,465 --> 01:52:23,592
<i>I think I managed to do that.</i>

1483
01:52:24,168 --> 01:52:27,569
I thought that I needed to press on...

1484
01:52:27,972 --> 01:52:31,066
<i>and get as far into it as I could.</i>

1485
01:52:31,542 --> 01:52:36,309
<i>Is blowin' in the wind</i>

1486
01:52:47,758 --> 01:52:52,457
<i>I would like to say that he has his finger</i>
<i>on the pulse of our generation.</i>

1487
01:52:53,564 --> 01:52:54,895
<i>Bob Dylan.</i>

1488
01:52:59,370 --> 01:53:03,170
<i>There will be singing through the night,</i>
<i>in the town of Newport.</i>

1489
01:53:39,874 --> 01:53:44,243
I'm looking for a place that will
"collect, clip, bath," and return my dog...

1490
01:53:44,512 --> 01:53:48,710
"KN1-7727, cigarettes and tobacco."

1491
01:53:50,184 --> 01:53:53,620
"Animals and birds bought
or sold on commission."

1492
01:53:54,255 --> 01:53:58,589
I want a dog that's gonna collect
and clean my bath, return my cigarette...

1493
01:53:58,793 --> 01:54:02,820
and give tobacco to my animals
and then give my birds a commission.

1494
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:05,626
I'm looking for somebody to sell my dog...

1495
01:54:05,766 --> 01:54:09,395
collect my clip, buy my animal,
and straighten out my bird.

1496
01:54:09,503 --> 01:54:11,994
I'm looking for a place to bathe my bird...

1497
01:54:12,974 --> 01:54:15,772
buy my dog, collect my clip...

1498
01:54:16,911 --> 01:54:19,573
sell me cigarettes and commission my bath.

1499
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:22,205
I'm looking for a place
that's going to collect my commission...

1500
01:54:22,316 --> 01:54:25,342
sell my dog, burn my bird,
and sell me to the cigarette.

1501
01:54:25,453 --> 01:54:30,186
Going to bird my buy, collect my will,
and bathe my commission.

1502
01:54:30,424 --> 01:54:33,416
I'm looking for a place
that's going to animal my soul...

1503
01:54:33,527 --> 01:54:36,963
knit my return, bathe my foot,
and collect my dog.

1504
01:54:37,164 --> 01:54:41,624
Commission me to sell my animals,
to the bird to clip and buy my bath...

1505
01:54:41,736 --> 01:54:43,533
and return me back to the cigarettes.

1506
01:54:56,083 --> 01:54:59,484
<i>These are all protest songs. Now, come on.</i>

1507
01:55:03,424 --> 01:55:07,053
<i>This is not British music,
it's American music. Now, come on.</i>

1508
01:55:17,872 --> 01:55:22,366
<i>When you're lost in the rain in Juarez</i>

1509
01:55:22,476 --> 01:55:25,502
<i>And it's Eastertime too</i>

1510
01:55:28,616 --> 01:55:31,710
<i>When your gravity's down</i>

1511
01:55:31,952 --> 01:55:34,614
<i>And negativity don't get you through</i>

1512
01:55:38,793 --> 01:55:41,523
<i>Just don't put on any airs</i>

1513
01:55:42,229 --> 01:55:46,689
<i>When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue</i>

1514
01:55:49,637 --> 01:55:52,834
<i>They got some hungry women there</i>

1515
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:56,307
<i>And they really make a mess out of you</i>

1516
01:56:07,688 --> 01:56:09,246
<i>Sweet Melinda</i>

1517
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:13,417
<i>The peasants call her the goddess of gloom</i>

1518
01:56:16,630 --> 01:56:19,292
<i>She speaks good English</i>

1519
01:56:21,702 --> 01:56:22,691
My left fingertips?

1520
01:56:22,803 --> 01:56:24,794
- Yeah, let me feel them.
- Good God, man.

1521
01:56:25,206 --> 01:56:26,400
What?

1522
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:35,876
<i>And picking up Angel</i>

1523
01:56:35,983 --> 01:56:39,316
<i>Who just arrived here from the coast</i>

1524
01:56:42,690 --> 01:56:45,523
<i>Who looked so fine at first</i>

1525
01:56:46,694 --> 01:56:51,461
<i>But left looking just like a ghost</i>

1526
01:56:54,802 --> 01:56:55,860
Bob!

1527
01:57:13,454 --> 01:57:16,321
Every single one of them. That's...

1528
01:57:19,093 --> 01:57:21,152
That's all I do, is protest.

1529
01:57:36,877 --> 01:57:40,973
<i>The March on Washington was not only
a moment of extreme hopefulness...</i>

1530
01:57:41,081 --> 01:57:44,915
<i>it was a moment of the confirmation
of the possibility...</i>

1531
01:57:45,419 --> 01:57:47,614
of that hope becoming a reality.

1532
01:57:47,721 --> 01:57:52,420
That was the moment of recognition...

1533
01:57:52,593 --> 01:57:55,426
<i>of what people could do to change history.</i>

1534
01:57:55,763 --> 01:57:57,390
<i>I have a dream...</i>

1535
01:57:58,299 --> 01:57:59,823
<i>that one day...</i>

1536
01:58:00,968 --> 01:58:03,368
<i>this nation will rise up...</i>

1537
01:58:04,672 --> 01:58:07,163
<i>and live out the true meaning of its creed.;</i>

1538
01:58:08,442 --> 01:58:11,206
<i>"We hold these truths to be self-evident...</i>

1539
01:58:11,846 --> 01:58:13,814
<i>"that all men are created equal."</i>

1540
01:58:13,914 --> 01:58:16,610
<i>I was up close
when King was giving that speech.</i>

1541
01:58:17,084 --> 01:58:19,882
To this day it still affects me
in a profound way.

1542
01:58:20,488 --> 01:58:23,514
<i>I would like now to introduce
a young singer...</i>

1543
01:58:24,425 --> 01:58:27,189
<i>from New York, Bob Dylan.</i>

1544
01:58:32,132 --> 01:58:34,123
<i>I looked out the podium,
I looked out at the crowd...</i>

1545
01:58:34,235 --> 01:58:35,668
<i>and I remember thinking to myself.;</i>

1546
01:58:35,769 --> 01:58:38,260
<i>"Man, I've never seen such a large crowd."</i>

1547
01:58:38,372 --> 01:58:42,809
<i>Oh the time will come up
When the winds will stop</i>

1548
01:58:42,910 --> 01:58:46,368
<i>And the breeze will cease to be breathing</i>

1549
01:58:47,214 --> 01:58:51,548
<i>Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins</i>

1550
01:58:51,852 --> 01:58:55,117
<i>The hour that the ship comes in</i>

1551
01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:59,753
Free at last, free at last,
thank God Almighty.

1552
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:01,327
We are free at last.

1553
01:59:02,062 --> 01:59:06,158
<i>And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again</i>

1554
01:59:06,267 --> 01:59:11,170
<i>That the whole wide world is watching</i>

1555
01:59:15,843 --> 01:59:19,574
He would take individuals and infuse them
with life that you could understand.

1556
01:59:20,881 --> 01:59:25,215
So even if he never considered himself
a protest singer, he was a protest singer.

1557
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:29,285
And he saw what was happening
all around him...

1558
01:59:29,957 --> 01:59:33,017
and everybody else saw
what was happening all around them...

1559
01:59:33,127 --> 01:59:34,890
but he voiced that for the first time.

1560
01:59:35,629 --> 01:59:38,894
<i>"Hard rain's gonna fall"
means something's going to happen.</i>

1561
01:59:43,938 --> 01:59:48,068
<i>Oh, where have you been,
my blue-eyed son?</i>

1562
01:59:51,612 --> 01:59:54,979
<i>And where have you been,
my darling young one?</i>

1563
01:59:59,486 --> 02:00:04,253
<i>I've stumbled on the side
of 12 misty mountains</i>

1564
02:00:07,394 --> 02:00:12,127
<i>I've walked and I've crawled
on six crooked highways</i>

1565
02:00:15,202 --> 02:00:20,139
<i>I've stepped in the middle
of seven sad forests</i>

1566
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:28,213
<i>And I've been out in front
of a dozen dead oceans</i>

1567
02:00:31,151 --> 02:00:36,111
<i>I've been 10,000 miles
in the mouth of a graveyard</i>

1568
02:00:36,924 --> 02:00:40,451
<i>And it's a hard and it's a hard</i>

1569
02:00:41,328 --> 02:00:45,162
<i>And it's a hard and it's a hard</i>

1570
02:00:45,532 --> 02:00:46,829
<i>And it's a</i>

1571
02:00:46,934 --> 02:00:49,425
<i>He's been shot! Oswald has been shot.</i>

1572
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:54,507
<i>Rain's a-gonna fall</i>

1573
02:00:55,009 --> 02:00:59,969
We were going to make this world
a decent, better place...

1574
02:01:01,181 --> 02:01:04,776
but that loss,
I think it traumatized the nation terribly.

1575
02:01:11,859 --> 02:01:14,350
<i>The Emergency Civil Liberties Union...</i>

1576
02:01:14,461 --> 02:01:17,692
<i>was people who were really,
deeply involved...</i>

1577
02:01:17,798 --> 02:01:21,063
<i>in progressive politics, were idealists...</i>

1578
02:01:21,168 --> 02:01:23,932
<i>and had a dream about fairness and justice.</i>

1579
02:01:24,038 --> 02:01:28,304
<i>Well, here's Bobby, he's 21 years old
or whatever, he gets up there...</i>

1580
02:01:28,742 --> 02:01:32,974
and they're giving him an award
and his discomfort was extraordinary.

1581
02:01:33,914 --> 02:01:37,042
And he pointed his finger at them
and he said...

1582
02:01:38,519 --> 02:01:41,283
<i>"I haven't got any guitar. I can talk, though.</i>

1583
02:01:41,388 --> 02:01:43,515
<i>"I want to thank you
for the Tom Paine Award...</i>

1584
02:01:43,624 --> 02:01:46,115
<i>"on behalf of everybody
that went down to Cuba.</i>

1585
02:01:46,226 --> 02:01:50,219
<i>"First of all, because they're all young
and it took me a long time to get young...</i>

1586
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:53,265
<i>"and now I consider myself young,
and I'm proud of it.</i>

1587
02:01:53,867 --> 02:01:55,562
<i>"I'm proud that I'm young.</i>

1588
02:01:55,769 --> 02:01:58,738
<i>"And I only wish that all you people
who are sitting out here tonight...</i>

1589
02:01:58,839 --> 02:02:02,502
<i>"weren't here, and I could see
all kinds of faces with hair on their head...</i>

1590
02:02:02,609 --> 02:02:05,806
<i>"and everything like that,
everything leading to youngness. "</i>

1591
02:02:06,213 --> 02:02:08,943
<i>You know, they were trying to build me up
as a topical songwriter.</i>

1592
02:02:09,049 --> 02:02:11,745
<i>I was never a topical songwriter
to begin with...</i>

1593
02:02:11,852 --> 02:02:14,286
for whatever reason they were doing it...

1594
02:02:14,822 --> 02:02:18,553
was reasons not, really...
That didn't really apply to me.

1595
02:02:18,659 --> 02:02:21,787
<i>"Old people, when their hair grows out,
they should go out.</i>

1596
02:02:21,895 --> 02:02:24,193
<i>"I look down to see the people
that are governing me...</i>

1597
02:02:24,298 --> 02:02:27,392
<i>"and making my rules,
and they haven't got any hair on their head.</i>

1598
02:02:27,501 --> 02:02:29,230
<i>"I get very uptight about it.</i>

1599
02:02:29,336 --> 02:02:32,533
<i>"There's no black and white,
left and right to me any more.</i>

1600
02:02:32,906 --> 02:02:36,342
<i>"There's only up and down,
and down is very close to the ground.</i>

1601
02:02:36,677 --> 02:02:41,478
<i>"And I'm trying to go up without thinking
about anything trivial, such as politics. "</i>

1602
02:02:42,649 --> 02:02:46,278
The evening that Dylan
was given the Freedom Award...

1603
02:02:46,386 --> 02:02:49,048
from the Emergency Civil
Liberties Committee...

1604
02:02:49,456 --> 02:02:53,392
apparently he got up, stood on his hind legs
and said he was not a political poet...

1605
02:02:53,494 --> 02:02:56,292
and nobody's left wing servant...

1606
02:02:56,663 --> 02:03:00,155
but an independent minstrel or something.

1607
02:03:00,768 --> 02:03:03,236
<i>And astonished and pissed everybody off...</i>

1608
02:03:03,337 --> 02:03:06,306
<i>by not being a nice trained seal.</i>

1609
02:03:06,673 --> 02:03:10,700
People were expecting him to give
the same thing over and over again...

1610
02:03:11,211 --> 02:03:16,080
in a precise manner, and a precise theory,
in a precise way, and it got creepy...

1611
02:03:16,216 --> 02:03:21,085
<i>because why should you have to
push yourself into a tunnel that isn't yours?</i>

1612
02:03:21,188 --> 02:03:24,055
<i>I mean, you're driving along
and all these roads are apparent.</i>

1613
02:03:24,258 --> 02:03:27,989
Why do you have to take that tunnel,
and go in and it's literally a tunnel...

1614
02:03:28,095 --> 02:03:30,723
because it's political in its theory?

1615
02:03:30,898 --> 02:03:32,593
Whereas you're out there, driving around...

1616
02:03:32,699 --> 02:03:35,964
with all this other scenery going on,
and that's what you're bringing out.

1617
02:03:36,069 --> 02:03:38,537
I was like an outsider, anyway.

1618
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:42,268
I'd come to town as an outsider,
and still, in a lot of ways...

1619
02:03:42,376 --> 02:03:45,539
I was still more outside
than I ever was, really.

1620
02:03:45,846 --> 02:03:49,077
They were trying to make me an insider
to some kind of trip they were on.

1621
02:03:49,216 --> 02:03:50,547
I don't think so.

1622
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:03,287
<i>Through the mad mystic hammering</i>

1623
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:07,227
<i>of the wild ripping hail</i>

1624
02:04:07,668 --> 02:04:11,126
<i>The sky cracked its poems</i>

1625
02:04:11,238 --> 02:04:13,968
<i>in naked wonder</i>

1626
02:04:16,009 --> 02:04:19,843
<i>That the clinging of the church bells</i>

1627
02:04:19,947 --> 02:04:23,610
<i>blew far into the night</i>

1628
02:04:23,717 --> 02:04:27,653
<i>Leaving only bells of lightning</i>

1629
02:04:27,754 --> 02:04:30,052
<i>and its thunder</i>

1630
02:04:33,327 --> 02:04:36,660
<i>Striking for the gentle</i>

1631
02:04:37,564 --> 02:04:40,965
<i>striking for the kind</i>

1632
02:04:41,702 --> 02:04:45,001
<i>Striking for the guardians</i>

1633
02:04:45,105 --> 02:04:48,871
<i>and protectors of the mind</i>

1634
02:04:49,243 --> 02:04:52,838
<i>And the poet and the painter</i>

1635
02:04:52,946 --> 02:04:57,042
<i>who lights up his rightful time</i>

1636
02:04:57,317 --> 02:04:59,512
<i>And we gazed upon</i>

1637
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:02,953
<i>The chimes of freedom flashing</i>

1638
02:05:09,463 --> 02:05:12,955
<i>Bob had a concert at
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium...</i>

1639
02:05:13,066 --> 02:05:16,160
where he told everybody how he
and Neuwirth and them had traveled...

1640
02:05:16,270 --> 02:05:19,797
<i>across the country
and he sang Chimes of Freedom Flashing...</i>

1641
02:05:20,007 --> 02:05:21,201
and it was incredible.

1642
02:05:25,045 --> 02:05:28,879
<i>After the concert,
all of a sudden we found ourselves trapped.</i>

1643
02:05:28,982 --> 02:05:31,678
<i>There was a press of people outside.</i>

1644
02:05:31,885 --> 02:05:35,946
We made it into the station wagon,
and then all the people came rushing over...

1645
02:05:36,056 --> 02:05:40,288
to the station wagon, and we slowly
started to move the station wagon out.

1646
02:05:40,527 --> 02:05:44,486
And I turned around and saw...
There was an amp and his guitars...

1647
02:05:44,598 --> 02:05:48,694
and their suitcases in the back with a little
tarp over it, and I saw the tarp moving.

1648
02:05:48,802 --> 02:05:51,600
Two young girls stowed away
under the tarp.

1649
02:05:51,705 --> 02:05:54,606
So we had to stop and gently eject them.

1650
02:05:54,808 --> 02:05:57,242
And of course,
then all the people were pressing around.

1651
02:06:07,955 --> 02:06:09,081
<i>Bobby!</i>

1652
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,388
<i>All of a sudden, he had become an idol.</i>

1653
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:20,325
<i>That was the beginning of people
wanting more from him.</i>

1654
02:06:20,434 --> 02:06:22,834
You know,
as if just the songs weren't enough.

1655
02:06:23,870 --> 02:06:26,566
Everybody wanted to sleep with Bobby...

1656
02:06:27,975 --> 02:06:29,465
to get high with Bobby.

1657
02:06:29,576 --> 02:06:34,172
<i>The reverence was for Bobby,
but it was also for what he had created...</i>

1658
02:06:34,281 --> 02:06:36,841
<i>and everybody wanted to get close to it.</i>

1659
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:41,649
The desire to be next to him produced
a huge magnet which drew everybody.

1660
02:06:42,856 --> 02:06:44,346
Young and old.

1661
02:06:44,558 --> 02:06:48,585
Genius makes its own rules,
and Dylan is a genius.

1662
02:06:48,695 --> 02:06:52,688
A singing conscience and moral referee,
as well as a preacher.

1663
02:06:52,799 --> 02:06:55,700
He's also a very embarrassed
young man now, because...

1664
02:06:55,802 --> 02:06:59,636
It's always embarrassing to sit there
with your feet in cement...

1665
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:03,107
while somebody compliments you
either casually or lavishly.

1666
02:07:05,245 --> 02:07:09,341
But, I've been reading a number of stories
about Bob this afternoon...

1667
02:07:09,449 --> 02:07:11,440
and they are all of that order.

1668
02:07:13,353 --> 02:07:15,821
<i>A comment in Billboard,
the trade publication, says:</i>

1669
02:07:15,922 --> 02:07:18,755
"Dylan's poetry is born
of a painful awareness...

1670
02:07:18,859 --> 02:07:22,590
"of the tragedy that underlies
the contemporary human condition."

1671
02:07:22,696 --> 02:07:25,824
Bob, do you sing partly your own songs...

1672
02:07:25,932 --> 02:07:28,400
and partly other people's,
or where do you get your material?

1673
02:07:28,502 --> 02:07:31,596
- Well, they're all mine, now.
- You sing all your own material?

1674
02:07:31,705 --> 02:07:34,503
And how long have you been writing
your own music?

1675
02:07:35,942 --> 02:07:38,433
For about two years.

1676
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:44,216
<i>He came to be as he is
because things needed saying...</i>

1677
02:07:44,317 --> 02:07:47,514
<i>and the young people were the ones
who wanted to say them.</i>

1678
02:07:47,821 --> 02:07:50,722
<i>He somehow had an ear on his generation.</i>

1679
02:07:50,924 --> 02:07:54,621
I don't have to tell you.
You know him, he's yours, Bob Dylan.

1680
02:07:58,765 --> 02:08:01,529
<i>I ain't looking to compete with you</i>

1681
02:08:01,902 --> 02:08:05,668
<i>Beat or cheat or mistreat you</i>

1682
02:08:06,239 --> 02:08:10,300
<i>Simplify you, classify you</i>

1683
02:08:10,510 --> 02:08:14,640
<i>Deny, defy or crucify you</i>

1684
02:08:14,748 --> 02:08:17,740
<i>All I really want to do</i>

1685
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:23,083
<i>Is, baby, be friends with you</i>

1686
02:08:37,704 --> 02:08:38,932
I want to say thank you.

1687
02:08:39,039 --> 02:08:42,304
I want to say thank you.
I want to say thank you, I love you.

1688
02:08:42,409 --> 02:08:46,539
<i>Well, it ain't no use
to sit and wonder why, baby</i>

1689
02:08:48,582 --> 02:08:51,142
<i>If you don't know by now</i>

1690
02:08:51,418 --> 02:08:55,218
<i>Johnny Cash was more like
a religious figure to me.</i>

1691
02:08:55,989 --> 02:08:59,516
<i>And there he was at Newport,
you know, standing side by side.</i>

1692
02:08:59,893 --> 02:09:02,225
Meeting him was the high thrill of a lifetime.

1693
02:09:02,329 --> 02:09:05,423
And, just the fact
that he had sung one of my songs...

1694
02:09:05,532 --> 02:09:08,865
was just unthinkable.

1695
02:09:09,102 --> 02:09:13,471
<i>Johnny Cash and June Carter came by
after Bob had put a couple...</i>

1696
02:09:13,573 --> 02:09:16,269
<i>three tunes on tape for him,
this little portable machine.</i>

1697
02:09:16,376 --> 02:09:18,503
Johnny called him out in the hall...

1698
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:24,210
and Bob came back in a few minutes later,
he was holding this guitar and he says:

1699
02:09:24,317 --> 02:09:25,944
"He gave me his guitar."

1700
02:09:26,052 --> 02:09:28,350
Neuwirth was saying,
"Wow, that's an old country tradition.

1701
02:09:28,455 --> 02:09:31,083
"If somebody gives you a guitar,
that's a big honor, you know?"

1702
02:09:31,358 --> 02:09:33,986
<i>This is called Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man.</i>

1703
02:09:35,028 --> 02:09:36,928
"Please play a song for me."

1704
02:09:41,268 --> 02:09:46,001
<i>Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man,
play a song for me</i>

1705
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:51,034
<i>I'm not sleepy
and there is no place I'm going to</i>

1706
02:09:52,579 --> 02:09:57,278
<i>Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man,
play a song for me</i>

1707
02:09:57,951 --> 02:10:00,647
<i>In the jingle jangle morning</i>

1708
02:10:00,787 --> 02:10:03,347
<i>I'll come following you</i>

1709
02:10:08,061 --> 02:10:11,428
<i>Though I know that evening's empire</i>

1710
02:10:11,531 --> 02:10:13,795
<i>has returned into sand</i>

1711
02:10:14,768 --> 02:10:19,467
<i>Vanished from my hand
left me blindly here to stand</i>

1712
02:10:19,573 --> 02:10:21,507
<i>but still not sleeping</i>

1713
02:10:23,076 --> 02:10:25,909
<i>My weariness amazes me</i>

1714
02:10:26,012 --> 02:10:28,446
<i>I'm branded on my feet</i>

1715
02:10:29,015 --> 02:10:31,313
<i>I have no one to meet</i>

1716
02:10:31,418 --> 02:10:36,355
<i>And the ancient empty streets
too dead for dreaming</i>

1717
02:10:37,424 --> 02:10:42,088
<i>When Bob began to ignore topical material,
it bothered me...</i>

1718
02:10:42,362 --> 02:10:45,024
'cause he wrote such marvelous material,
you know?

1719
02:10:47,067 --> 02:10:50,594
And suddenly to have stopped that
meant that he was going away...

1720
02:10:51,271 --> 02:10:55,264
<i>from a political consciousness
that we felt we all had.</i>

1721
02:10:55,375 --> 02:10:58,173
<i>One can attribute that
as going commercial...</i>

1722
02:10:59,579 --> 02:11:03,515
as getting away from this,
and that bothered us.

1723
02:11:04,184 --> 02:11:07,153
<i>Then take me disappearing</i>

1724
02:11:07,254 --> 02:11:09,882
<i>through the smoke rings of my mind</i>

1725
02:11:10,290 --> 02:11:12,850
<i>Down the foggy ruins of time</i>

1726
02:11:13,593 --> 02:11:15,993
<i>far past the frozen leaves</i>

1727
02:11:16,363 --> 02:11:19,196
<i>The haunted, frightened trees</i>

1728
02:11:19,499 --> 02:11:21,694
<i>out to the windy beach</i>

1729
02:11:21,801 --> 02:11:26,465
<i>Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow</i>

1730
02:11:27,774 --> 02:11:31,335
<i>Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky</i>

1731
02:11:31,444 --> 02:11:33,810
<i>with one hand waving free</i>

1732
02:11:33,913 --> 02:11:36,677
<i>Silhouetted by the sea</i>

1733
02:11:36,783 --> 02:11:39,377
<i>circled by the circus sands</i>

1734
02:11:39,719 --> 02:11:42,483
<i>With all memory and fate</i>

1735
02:11:42,789 --> 02:11:45,519
<i>driven deep beneath the waves</i>

1736
02:11:45,692 --> 02:11:48,559
<i>Let me forget about today</i>

1737
02:11:48,662 --> 02:11:50,789
<i>until tomorrow</i>

1738
02:11:52,232 --> 02:11:55,099
<i>An artist has got to be careful
never really to arrive at a place...</i>

1739
02:11:55,201 --> 02:11:56,725
<i>where he thinks he's "at" somewhere.</i>

1740
02:11:56,836 --> 02:11:59,805
You always have to realize
that you're constantly...

1741
02:11:59,906 --> 02:12:02,033
in the state of becoming, you know?

1742
02:12:03,143 --> 02:12:06,977
And, as long as you can stay in that realm,
you'll sort of be all right.

1743
02:12:08,515 --> 02:12:12,508
<i>I can't self-analyze my own work,
and I wasn't going to cater to the crowd...</i>

1744
02:12:12,619 --> 02:12:16,385
<i>because I knew certain people would like it,
and certain people didn't like it.</i>

1745
02:12:16,489 --> 02:12:18,423
<i>I had gotten in the door
when no one was looking.</i>

1746
02:12:18,525 --> 02:12:21,653
<i>I was in there now,
and there was nothing anybody...</i>

1747
02:12:21,761 --> 02:12:23,922
<i>from then on, could ever do about it.</i>

1748
02:12:24,230 --> 02:12:29,065
There's a time when the operation
of the machine becomes so odious...

1749
02:12:29,869 --> 02:12:33,305
makes you so sick at heart
that you can't take part.

1750
02:12:33,406 --> 02:12:37,137
You can't even passively take part,
and you've got to put your bodies...

1751
02:12:37,243 --> 02:12:41,839
upon the gears and upon the wheels,
upon the levers, upon all the apparatus...

1752
02:12:41,948 --> 02:12:45,179
and you've got to make it stop,
and you've got to indicate to the people...

1753
02:12:45,285 --> 02:12:48,152
who run it, to the people who own it,
that unless you're free...

1754
02:12:48,254 --> 02:12:51,246
the machine will be prevented
from working at all.

1755
02:12:56,262 --> 02:12:59,993
<i>The police have got Mario,
they are pulling him away.</i>

1756
02:13:01,434 --> 02:13:03,265
<i>The police have pulled Mario away...</i>

1757
02:13:03,370 --> 02:13:08,137
<i>All of us felt that those folks
before didn't get it.</i>

1758
02:13:08,375 --> 02:13:09,899
<i>We were surrounded...</i>

1759
02:13:11,077 --> 02:13:14,410
by people who were insensitive
to the need for change.

1760
02:13:14,914 --> 02:13:17,974
<i>And that's why Peter, Paul and Mary,
and Bob Dylan, Joan Baez...</i>

1761
02:13:18,084 --> 02:13:22,316
<i>all of whom were about the same age,
were put in positions of leadership...</i>

1762
02:13:22,422 --> 02:13:26,449
because there was an identification
amongst the college students.

1763
02:13:27,994 --> 02:13:29,757
<i>I felt it all over America.</i>

1764
02:13:29,929 --> 02:13:34,127
<i>You know, wherever in America you went,
you felt that things were happening...</i>

1765
02:13:34,234 --> 02:13:35,963
<i>in an Olympian type of way...</i>

1766
02:13:36,236 --> 02:13:38,329
in which children were beyond
their parents' command.

1767
02:13:38,438 --> 02:13:41,168
<i>He tried to exercise free speech...</i>

1768
02:13:42,609 --> 02:13:46,443
Sometime around that period of time
I was painting in Berkeley...

1769
02:13:46,546 --> 02:13:49,071
and the phone rang,
and I think this was 1964.

1770
02:13:49,182 --> 02:13:50,740
The phone rang, it was Bob and he said:

1771
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:52,977
<i>"I have to do these shows,
you want to come?"</i>

1772
02:13:53,086 --> 02:13:55,247
<i>I said, "Well, I'm painting pictures."</i>

1773
02:13:55,355 --> 02:13:59,052
He said, "I'll buy you a leather jacket,"
and he said, "all the paint you need."

1774
02:13:59,159 --> 02:14:02,026
<i>The next thing I knew, you know,
I got on a plane...</i>

1775
02:14:02,629 --> 02:14:04,392
and I flew to New York.

1776
02:14:04,497 --> 02:14:08,558
In those days, artistic success...

1777
02:14:09,636 --> 02:14:11,365
was not dollar-driven.

1778
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:16,600
It was, you know...
Those were simpler times.

1779
02:14:17,143 --> 02:14:20,943
If you had something to say,
which was the...

1780
02:14:21,681 --> 02:14:23,842
Basically, the way people were rated...

1781
02:14:24,417 --> 02:14:26,715
you know, they'd say:
"Have you seen Ornette Coleman?

1782
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:28,287
"Does he have anything to say?"

1783
02:14:28,388 --> 02:14:31,585
And it was the same with, like...
With Bob or anybody else.

1784
02:14:31,691 --> 02:14:33,386
Do they have anything to say or not?

1785
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:37,287
<i>Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon</i>

1786
02:14:37,397 --> 02:14:39,865
<i>The handmade blade, the child's balloon</i>

1787
02:14:39,966 --> 02:14:43,902
<i>Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon</i>

1788
02:14:44,003 --> 02:14:45,766
<i>There is no sense in trying</i>

1789
02:14:54,047 --> 02:14:56,538
<i>As pointed threats, they bluff with scorn</i>

1790
02:14:56,716 --> 02:14:59,947
<i>Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece</i>

1791
02:15:00,053 --> 02:15:02,954
<i>The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn</i>

1792
02:15:03,056 --> 02:15:05,490
<i>That he not busy being born
Is busy dying</i>

1793
02:15:10,363 --> 02:15:12,228
<i>Nobody had heard anything like this before.</i>

1794
02:15:12,332 --> 02:15:15,130
No one had heard anything like this before.

1795
02:15:15,802 --> 02:15:17,997
<i>There was a word of mouth.</i>

1796
02:15:18,371 --> 02:15:21,807
<i>And by the way, a crowd of 1,200 people
isn't that big a crowd...</i>

1797
02:15:21,908 --> 02:15:23,398
<i>if you stop and think about it.</i>

1798
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:25,944
That's about how many people
are waiting for the D train...

1799
02:15:26,045 --> 02:15:28,070
at Sheridan Square right now.

1800
02:15:28,915 --> 02:15:31,213
<i>While preachers preach of evil fates</i>

1801
02:15:31,317 --> 02:15:34,582
<i>Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates</i>

1802
02:15:34,687 --> 02:15:38,316
<i>Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States</i>

1803
02:15:38,424 --> 02:15:40,824
<i>Sometimes must have to stand naked</i>

1804
02:15:42,328 --> 02:15:45,126
Around that time he asked me
if I wanted to go with him to...

1805
02:15:45,231 --> 02:15:47,893
You know, he had a date in Chicago.

1806
02:15:48,001 --> 02:15:49,400
Did I want to come along?

1807
02:15:49,502 --> 02:15:52,835
<i>What struck me was that he was at one...</i>

1808
02:15:52,939 --> 02:15:55,669
<i>or he became identical with his breath.</i>

1809
02:15:56,743 --> 02:16:01,680
And Dylan had become a column of air,
so to speak, at certain moments...

1810
02:16:02,248 --> 02:16:05,706
where his total physical
and mental focus was...

1811
02:16:06,486 --> 02:16:10,889
this single breath coming out of his body.

1812
02:16:11,357 --> 02:16:15,589
He had a found a way in public
to be almost like a shaman...

1813
02:16:16,262 --> 02:16:19,163
with all of his intelligence
and consciousness...

1814
02:16:19,899 --> 02:16:21,764
focused on his breath.

1815
02:16:22,101 --> 02:16:25,127
<i>So don't fear if you hear</i>

1816
02:16:26,172 --> 02:16:29,630
<i>A foreign sound to your ear</i>

1817
02:16:33,012 --> 02:16:34,946
<i>It's alright, Ma</i>

1818
02:16:37,884 --> 02:16:39,442
<i>I'm only sighing</i>

1819
02:16:44,357 --> 02:16:47,417
He was doing more and more
prose writing, I think, at the time, too.

1820
02:16:47,527 --> 02:16:49,392
I think he was spending more time...

1821
02:16:49,495 --> 02:16:51,019
actually sitting down and writing stuff...

1822
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:52,688
<i>that he wasn't necessarily going to sing.</i>

1823
02:16:52,799 --> 02:16:54,357
<i>And then finding out
that some of that could be sung as well.</i>

1824
02:16:55,335 --> 02:16:58,862
<i>Of war and peace the truth just twists</i>

1825
02:16:59,339 --> 02:17:01,899
<i>lts curfew gull just glides</i>

1826
02:17:08,348 --> 02:17:12,079
<i>Upon four-legged forest clouds</i>

1827
02:17:12,318 --> 02:17:15,116
<i>The cowboy angel rides</i>

1828
02:17:17,423 --> 02:17:19,220
<i>The ideal performances of the songs...</i>

1829
02:17:19,325 --> 02:17:21,418
<i>would then come on stages
throughout the world.</i>

1830
02:17:22,128 --> 02:17:25,154
Very few could be found
on any of my records.

1831
02:17:25,565 --> 02:17:29,365
Every second, every... You know...

1832
02:17:29,535 --> 02:17:31,971
Reaching the audience is what it's all about.

1833
02:17:32,071 --> 02:17:36,508
<i>All except when 'neath the trees of Eden</i>

1834
02:17:43,549 --> 02:17:47,849
<i>There are no veils, curtains, doors, walls...</i>

1835
02:17:47,954 --> 02:17:52,050
anything between
what pours out of Bob's hand...

1836
02:17:52,158 --> 02:17:53,557
onto the page...

1837
02:17:53,660 --> 02:17:58,495
and what is somehow available
to the core of people...

1838
02:17:58,598 --> 02:18:01,692
who are believers in him.

1839
02:18:01,801 --> 02:18:04,429
There's some people who'd say...
You know, not interested.

1840
02:18:04,537 --> 02:18:08,064
But if you're interested,
he goes way, way deep.

1841
02:18:10,209 --> 02:18:14,077
<i>Go away from my window</i>

1842
02:18:14,213 --> 02:18:17,614
<i>Leave at your own chosen speed</i>

1843
02:18:17,884 --> 02:18:19,249
<i>A typical evening.</i>

1844
02:18:19,952 --> 02:18:22,079
<i>I guess there would be soundcheck.</i>

1845
02:18:22,755 --> 02:18:25,849
<i>And there would be me
dealing with what kind of mood...</i>

1846
02:18:25,958 --> 02:18:27,550
<i>Bob was going to be in.</i>

1847
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:30,629
<i>I was already doing that, you know.</i>

1848
02:18:31,330 --> 02:18:34,731
<i>And when he was cheerful and up,
it was just spectacular.</i>

1849
02:18:35,168 --> 02:18:37,898
<i>And if he was dark,
there wasn't any way to reach him.</i>

1850
02:18:38,004 --> 02:18:40,336
<i>But always strong</i>

1851
02:18:40,707 --> 02:18:44,768
<i>Bob seemed to ignore
whatever was coming towards him.</i>

1852
02:18:44,877 --> 02:18:46,469
<i>He could literally, and I'd seen him do it...</i>

1853
02:18:46,579 --> 02:18:49,571
<i>turn his back and play a whole song,
play two songs.</i>

1854
02:18:50,183 --> 02:18:52,447
<i>Fiddling around with the equipment
on the stage.</i>

1855
02:18:52,552 --> 02:18:54,042
<i>And never even look at the public...</i>

1856
02:18:54,153 --> 02:18:57,418
<i>and it doesn't make the slightest bit
of difference in the magnetic draw.</i>

1857
02:18:58,124 --> 02:18:59,955
It's as though the public wasn't even there...

1858
02:19:00,059 --> 02:19:02,789
he's just going to do what he's going to do,
and he has to change.

1859
02:19:02,895 --> 02:19:06,558
And he has to keep moving, and he has to
add this and he has to crank the sound.

1860
02:19:06,666 --> 02:19:09,931
If you ever work with him, if he did
this song the night before as a waltz...

1861
02:19:10,036 --> 02:19:13,733
tonight he's gonna do it in 2/4 time,
just to fuck you up, you know?

1862
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:16,365
And so,
with somebody who moves like that...

1863
02:19:17,343 --> 02:19:21,404
I now see it, that it's very unique...

1864
02:19:21,848 --> 02:19:25,409
and it's admirable, and it's a pain in the ass
if you're trying to work with him.

1865
02:19:25,518 --> 02:19:28,919
Or it's a pain in the ass if you were
expecting something else from him.

1866
02:19:29,021 --> 02:19:31,854
If everybody really listened
to his own conscience...

1867
02:19:31,958 --> 02:19:35,257
and really acted upon what he thought
was right and wrong...

1868
02:19:35,361 --> 02:19:38,387
rather than being so hopelessly passive...

1869
02:19:38,498 --> 02:19:40,363
which I think just about everybody is.

1870
02:19:40,466 --> 02:19:42,331
I think it's probably the main disease...

1871
02:19:42,435 --> 02:19:46,166
is the passivity, where we will listen
to whatever anybody else says.

1872
02:19:46,272 --> 02:19:50,140
It's Daddy, and Mommy, and schoolteacher,
and Sunday school teacher, and President.

1873
02:19:54,614 --> 02:19:57,139
<i>This is what the war in Vietnam is all about.</i>

1874
02:20:01,521 --> 02:20:03,284
The old and the very young.

1875
02:20:05,091 --> 02:20:09,221
The Marines have burned
this old couple's cottage...

1876
02:20:09,328 --> 02:20:11,796
because fire was coming from here.

1877
02:20:12,732 --> 02:20:16,224
<i>The day's operation burned down
150 houses...</i>

1878
02:20:16,569 --> 02:20:19,299
<i>wounded three women, killed one baby...</i>

1879
02:20:19,772 --> 02:20:24,004
<i>wounded one Marine,
and netted these four prisoners.</i>

1880
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:28,471
<i>Four old men who could not answer
questions put to them in English.</i>

1881
02:20:59,645 --> 02:21:03,274
<i>I was feeling this political pull very strongly.</i>

1882
02:21:03,583 --> 02:21:07,144
And I was thinking what the two of us
could do together, you know...

1883
02:21:07,386 --> 02:21:10,150
as far as any kind of movement, and that...

1884
02:21:11,090 --> 02:21:14,548
And so, we...
Our tour had come to an end...

1885
02:21:14,961 --> 02:21:18,488
and Bob said something like:
"Hey, we ought to do Carnegie Hall...

1886
02:21:18,831 --> 02:21:20,958
"or some big place like that."

1887
02:21:21,067 --> 02:21:23,763
And I said,
"What are we going to do with it?"

1888
02:21:25,838 --> 02:21:28,636
And... It was a pretty cold thing to say.

1889
02:21:28,975 --> 02:21:30,840
But then we did talk about...

1890
02:21:31,744 --> 02:21:35,771
you know, that he wanted to do his music
and I wanted to do all this other stuff...

1891
02:21:35,882 --> 02:21:38,214
and he said he didn't want to do
all that other stuff...

1892
02:21:38,317 --> 02:21:40,251
you know, so that was pretty clear.

1893
02:21:40,353 --> 02:21:42,150
And yeah, I was disappointed.

1894
02:21:42,255 --> 02:21:46,555
<i>Oh my name it is nothing</i>

1895
02:21:48,127 --> 02:21:51,722
<i>My age it means less</i>

1896
02:21:52,498 --> 02:21:56,332
<i>I mean, he'd given us, by that point,
the greatest songs...</i>

1897
02:21:56,535 --> 02:21:59,504
<i>in our anti-war, civil rights arsenals.</i>

1898
02:22:00,072 --> 02:22:03,735
<i>Thirty-some years, whenever I go
to a march or a sit-in, or a lie-in...</i>

1899
02:22:03,843 --> 02:22:07,574
or a be-in, or a jail-in,
people'd say, "Is Bob coming?"

1900
02:22:08,381 --> 02:22:11,145
I'd say, "He never comes, you moron!"

1901
02:22:11,417 --> 02:22:15,410
You know, "When are you going to get it?
Never did, probably never will."

1902
02:22:17,723 --> 02:22:19,213
And so I think he...

1903
02:22:19,859 --> 02:22:23,124
I think he couldn't have written songs
like the ones he wrote...

1904
02:22:23,229 --> 02:22:27,063
if he didn't feel generally,
I think, sort of, for the underdog.

1905
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:32,534
But I think that he didn't want to have
to be the guy people were going to go to.

1906
02:22:32,738 --> 02:22:35,229
<i>I mean, the times then were cut and dry.</i>

1907
02:22:35,341 --> 02:22:37,536
<i>You were either for the war
or you were against it.</i>

1908
02:22:37,643 --> 02:22:41,511
You either hated niggers or, you know,
you supported King.

1909
02:22:42,148 --> 02:22:44,173
And you were forced to take a side.

1910
02:22:52,658 --> 02:22:55,092
<i>Johnny's in a basement
Mixing up the medicine</i>

1911
02:22:55,194 --> 02:22:57,822
<i>I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government</i>

1912
02:22:57,930 --> 02:23:00,956
<i>The man in the trench coat
badge out, laid off</i>

1913
02:23:01,067 --> 02:23:03,797
<i>Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off</i>

1914
02:23:03,903 --> 02:23:06,167
<i>Look out kid
It's something you did</i>

1915
02:23:06,272 --> 02:23:08,638
<i>God knows when
But you're doing it again</i>

1916
02:23:08,741 --> 02:23:10,436
<i>You better duck down the alleyway</i>

1917
02:23:10,543 --> 02:23:11,737
<i>Looking for a new friend</i>

1918
02:23:11,844 --> 02:23:13,835
<i>The man in the coon-skin cap
In a pig pen</i>

1919
02:23:13,946 --> 02:23:16,915
<i>Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten</i>

1920
02:23:22,722 --> 02:23:25,850
<i>Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot</i>

1921
02:23:25,958 --> 02:23:28,324
<i>Talking that the heat put
plants in the bed but</i>

1922
02:23:28,427 --> 02:23:30,952
<i>The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say</i>

1923
02:23:31,063 --> 02:23:33,725
<i>They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A.</i>

1924
02:23:33,833 --> 02:23:36,495
<i>Look out kid
Don't matter what you did</i>

1925
02:23:36,602 --> 02:23:39,230
<i>Walk on your tiptoes
Don't tie no dose</i>

1926
02:23:39,338 --> 02:23:42,136
<i>Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose</i>

1927
02:23:42,241 --> 02:23:44,869
<i>Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes</i>

1928
02:23:44,977 --> 02:23:48,743
<i>You don't need a weather man
to know which way the wind blows</i>

1929
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:51,682
<i>Words have their own meaning,
or they have different meanings...</i>

1930
02:23:51,784 --> 02:23:53,684
<i>and words change their meaning.</i>

1931
02:23:53,786 --> 02:23:56,687
Words that meant something
10 years ago don't mean that now.

1932
02:23:56,789 --> 02:23:57,847
They mean something else.

1933
02:23:57,957 --> 02:23:59,948
<i>Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schooling</i>

1934
02:24:00,059 --> 02:24:01,686
<i>And they put you on the day shift</i>

1935
02:24:01,794 --> 02:24:04,092
<i>Look out kid
They keep it all hid</i>

1936
02:24:04,196 --> 02:24:07,188
<i>Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle</i>

1937
02:24:07,299 --> 02:24:10,291
<i>Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals</i>

1938
02:24:10,403 --> 02:24:12,496
<i>Don't want to be a bum
You better chew gum</i>

1939
02:24:12,605 --> 02:24:15,631
<i>The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles</i>

1940
02:24:17,476 --> 02:24:19,068
<i>Subterranean Homesick Blues.
I mean...</i>

1941
02:24:19,178 --> 02:24:21,237
<i>I don't think I would have wanted to do it
all by myself.</i>

1942
02:24:21,347 --> 02:24:25,977
I thought I'd get more power out of it,
you know, with a small group in back of me.

1943
02:24:26,185 --> 02:24:30,212
It was electric,
but doesn't necessarily mean...

1944
02:24:30,823 --> 02:24:34,589
that it's modernized
just because it's electric, you know?

1945
02:24:35,227 --> 02:24:38,196
It was, you know, like a...

1946
02:24:39,832 --> 02:24:41,322
Country music was electric, too.

1947
02:24:41,434 --> 02:24:43,527
<i>I ain't gonna work</i>

1948
02:24:43,636 --> 02:24:46,400
<i>on Maggie's farm no more</i>

1949
02:24:47,106 --> 02:24:51,042
<i>The Bringing It All Back Home
session was really fun because...</i>

1950
02:24:51,444 --> 02:24:55,574
it was this sort of spontaneous,
telepathic thing, you know?

1951
02:24:56,949 --> 02:25:01,386
Like he might have, you know,
played through a song very briefly...

1952
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:06,184
<i>and that was all the rehearsal or preparation
that anyone had for the songs.</i>

1953
02:25:06,659 --> 02:25:11,119
Everyone was really good,
everyone was really funky, you know...

1954
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:13,164
everyone had great time.

1955
02:25:14,233 --> 02:25:17,691
And everyone really
got behind Bobby's songs.

1956
02:25:18,270 --> 02:25:20,898
<i>It was almost like just getting
together and jamming...</i>

1957
02:25:21,006 --> 02:25:25,306
<i>without any mandate
or any charts or anything.</i>

1958
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:33,044
<i>I was riding on the Mayflower
when I thought I spied some land</i>

1959
02:25:33,986 --> 02:25:36,477
<i>He was playing all by himself, at first.</i>

1960
02:25:36,589 --> 02:25:39,080
And then he stopped
and everybody laughed...

1961
02:25:39,758 --> 02:25:43,524
and then two seconds later,
he started it again...

1962
02:25:43,629 --> 02:25:46,655
and everybody came in just "bang,"
like gangbusters.

1963
02:25:46,999 --> 02:25:51,333
<i>I was riding on the Mayflower
when I thought I spied some land</i>

1964
02:25:51,837 --> 02:25:55,898
<i>I yelled for Captain Arab
I have you understand</i>

1965
02:25:56,375 --> 02:26:00,709
<i>Who came running to the deck
Said, "Boys forget the whale</i>

1966
02:26:00,913 --> 02:26:05,145
<i>"Look on over yonder
Cut the engines change the sail</i>

1967
02:26:05,751 --> 02:26:09,687
<i>Haul on the bowline"
We sang that melody</i>

1968
02:26:09,788 --> 02:26:14,225
<i>Like all tough sailors do
When they're far away at sea</i>

1969
02:26:15,027 --> 02:26:16,790
I mean, the whole culture
has moved and changed.

1970
02:26:16,896 --> 02:26:18,227
This is really what we're announcing.

1971
02:26:18,330 --> 02:26:20,855
The entire culture, both in America
and England has changed.

1972
02:26:20,966 --> 02:26:23,799
There's a whole new generation
that's grown up, everybody.

1973
02:26:23,903 --> 02:26:25,530
Do people at the Museum of Modern Art...

1974
02:26:25,638 --> 02:26:27,538
and the Metropolitan know about this,
do you think?

1975
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:30,473
Do they know that culture has changed,
that there's a new generation?

1976
02:26:30,576 --> 02:26:31,975
Well, they have been in the foreground...

1977
02:26:32,077 --> 02:26:34,170
of showing all this new pop art themselves,
you know.

1978
02:26:34,280 --> 02:26:36,714
Warhol will be there in Albert Hall,
and Warhol's on the walls...

1979
02:26:36,815 --> 02:26:39,682
of the Museum of Modern Art
for the last five years.

1980
02:26:47,226 --> 02:26:50,423
<i>There were signs of new life,
of another generation picking up...</i>

1981
02:26:50,529 --> 02:26:53,726
<i>a revolution in consciousness.
A bloodless revolution.</i>

1982
02:26:54,300 --> 02:26:57,167
You know, like the first revolution
that never shed any blood.

1983
02:26:57,503 --> 02:26:58,902
That was the important thing.

1984
02:26:59,004 --> 02:27:00,995
<i>I had just been kicked out of Cuba...</i>

1985
02:27:01,106 --> 02:27:02,573
<i>for just talking privately...</i>

1986
02:27:02,675 --> 02:27:06,702
about Castro's persecution of gay people.

1987
02:27:06,812 --> 02:27:11,681
<i>Then went to Czechoslovakia,
was elected King of May on May Day.</i>

1988
02:27:12,051 --> 02:27:15,817
A week later was kicked out by the Minister
of Education and deported to London...

1989
02:27:15,921 --> 02:27:20,756
and then I landed around the time
of Dylan's concerts at Albert Hall.

1990
02:27:21,193 --> 02:27:24,424
<i>There was a very exciting scene,
back at the hotel...</i>

1991
02:27:24,763 --> 02:27:28,130
<i>and Dylan was down the hall
with the Beatles.</i>

1992
02:27:28,734 --> 02:27:31,828
<i>Then a message came
that I was supposed to come in there.</i>

1993
02:27:31,937 --> 02:27:35,134
<i>So I came into the room
and everybody was sitting there...</i>

1994
02:27:35,241 --> 02:27:38,540
totally stone-cold silent, frozen, paranoid.

1995
02:27:39,011 --> 02:27:41,309
<i>Not quite knowing my place, knowing Bob...</i>

1996
02:27:41,413 --> 02:27:44,746
<i>I sat down on the side of his armchair.</i>

1997
02:27:45,017 --> 02:27:48,612
John Lennon said snidely,
"Why don't you sit a little closer?"

1998
02:27:49,588 --> 02:27:52,921
I suddenly realized they were just so naive,
they were young.

1999
02:27:53,359 --> 02:27:56,988
So I actually, I fell over laughing
on to John's lap...

2000
02:27:58,364 --> 02:28:01,333
Iooking up at him and asked him,
"Do you ever read William Blake?"

2001
02:28:01,433 --> 02:28:05,335
He said, "Never heard of him."
And his wife said, "Oh, John, stop lying."

2002
02:28:05,537 --> 02:28:08,267
Then everybody began laughing,
and then the scene sort of broke up.

2003
02:28:08,374 --> 02:28:10,239
You know, the ice was broken.

2004
02:28:10,643 --> 02:28:14,010
It stuck me as funny
that these guys at the summit of power...

2005
02:28:14,480 --> 02:28:17,711
spiritual power, musical power,
world fame...

2006
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:19,884
'65, May... June...

2007
02:28:20,786 --> 02:28:23,448
were so unsure...

2008
02:28:23,722 --> 02:28:26,316
of their minds and speech.

2009
02:28:33,932 --> 02:28:35,729
It interested me just to watch Dylan.

2010
02:28:35,834 --> 02:28:39,395
I could sort of see
that things that he did and said...

2011
02:28:39,905 --> 02:28:41,497
were interesting to me.

2012
02:28:42,074 --> 02:28:46,534
And I didn't know why, and so that got me
hooked on making a movie.

2013
02:28:46,645 --> 02:28:48,875
- Do you really like that song?
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

2014
02:28:48,981 --> 02:28:50,710
- What do you like about it?
- I just...

2015
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:53,250
<i>I don't like any of the
Subterranean Homesick Blues.</i>

2016
02:28:53,352 --> 02:28:56,253
Oh, you're that kind of...
Okay, see, I understand right now.

2017
02:28:56,355 --> 02:28:59,882
<i>When we'd go into a town,
there would be no sign...</i>

2018
02:29:00,793 --> 02:29:04,456
and there would be people,
kind of, just hanging out at the steps...

2019
02:29:05,464 --> 02:29:07,295
waiting for him to...

2020
02:29:07,399 --> 02:29:10,493
And not waiting to crowd around
or see him or get his autograph.

2021
02:29:10,602 --> 02:29:12,092
Just waiting for him.

2022
02:29:12,471 --> 02:29:16,840
And it gave you a feeling that there
was some substance that you had to really...

2023
02:29:17,476 --> 02:29:20,502
see through, that you weren't
going to find out about this quickly.

2024
02:29:20,612 --> 02:29:22,409
But you had to kind of see it
the way they did.

2025
02:29:23,082 --> 02:29:26,609
<i>In the dime stores and bus stations</i>

2026
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:30,154
<i>People talk over situations</i>

2027
02:29:31,590 --> 02:29:34,457
<i>Read books and repeat quotations</i>

2028
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:38,287
<i>Draw conclusions on the wall</i>

2029
02:29:41,333 --> 02:29:44,063
<i>Some speak of the future</i>

2030
02:29:45,604 --> 02:29:48,573
<i>My love she speaks softly</i>

2031
02:29:48,974 --> 02:29:52,068
<i>She knows there's no success like failure</i>

2032
02:29:52,578 --> 02:29:55,809
<i>And that failure's no success at all</i>

2033
02:29:57,716 --> 02:29:59,707
Do you care about what you sing?

2034
02:30:00,452 --> 02:30:02,852
How could I answer that
if you got the nerve to ask me?

2035
02:30:02,955 --> 02:30:03,944
Well, then you have...

2036
02:30:04,056 --> 02:30:06,684
I mean, you've got a lot of nerve
asking me a question like that.

2037
02:30:06,792 --> 02:30:07,986
Do you ask the Beatles that?

2038
02:30:08,093 --> 02:30:11,494
I have to ask you that, because you have
the nerve to question whether I can...

2039
02:30:11,597 --> 02:30:14,657
I'm not questioning you,
because I don't expect any answer from you.

2040
02:30:14,767 --> 02:30:18,703
But do you think somebody wouldn't go see
somebody if they didn't want entertainment?

2041
02:30:19,405 --> 02:30:22,704
<i>In the dime stores and bus stations</i>

2042
02:30:22,808 --> 02:30:24,332
<i>We showed him the first rough cut.</i>

2043
02:30:24,443 --> 02:30:28,243
<i>What he saw must have made him look like
he was bare bones...</i>

2044
02:30:28,814 --> 02:30:30,645
and I think that was a big shock to him.

2045
02:30:30,749 --> 02:30:34,810
But then he saw, I think the second night,
he saw that it was total theater.

2046
02:30:35,087 --> 02:30:36,179
It didn't matter.

2047
02:30:36,288 --> 02:30:40,452
He was like an actor,
and he suddenly had reinvented himself...

2048
02:30:40,559 --> 02:30:43,756
as the actor within this movie,
and then it was okay.

2049
02:30:44,430 --> 02:30:47,365
<i>That's what he's good at,
is getting used to the way things are.</i>

2050
02:30:47,466 --> 02:30:50,333
<i>I mean, he understands
that time changes everything.</i>

2051
02:30:50,436 --> 02:30:53,701
They didn't light places,
they didn't have to stop filming.

2052
02:30:53,806 --> 02:30:55,671
If you ran, they ran.

2053
02:30:56,074 --> 02:30:58,941
If you went in a room,
they went into the room.

2054
02:30:59,211 --> 02:31:03,648
And you know, at a certain point,
you just became oblivious to that.

2055
02:31:22,401 --> 02:31:25,598
<i>I was young, and I had expectations.</i>

2056
02:31:25,704 --> 02:31:28,070
And wanted to be where the action was...

2057
02:31:28,173 --> 02:31:31,540
and I should not have been there
at that time.

2058
02:31:31,643 --> 02:31:35,010
<i>Everybody was having a wonderful time
and they were all smashing things up...</i>

2059
02:31:35,113 --> 02:31:38,378
<i>in the hotel room, and I was
this weird square over in my room...</i>

2060
02:31:38,484 --> 02:31:40,247
<i>who didn't do all that stuff.</i>

2061
02:31:40,352 --> 02:31:43,947
<i>I was very critical of everybody who did,
and wanted my time with Bob...</i>

2062
02:31:44,056 --> 02:31:47,992
because I thought he was a special friend,
and he had moved on.

2063
02:31:49,027 --> 02:31:52,428
And it was awful.
I mean, it just hurt like hell.

2064
02:31:52,531 --> 02:31:56,729
I thought, I assumed, that since
I'd invited him on the stage in the States...

2065
02:31:56,869 --> 02:32:00,100
he would invite me on the stage there.
He had no intention of doing that.

2066
02:32:00,205 --> 02:32:01,502
<i>- Bob?
- Bob?</i>

2067
02:32:04,977 --> 02:32:08,708
He was ready to have that whole stage
all to himself, that's what I'd say.

2068
02:32:08,814 --> 02:32:11,248
He didn't want anybody competing with it.

2069
02:32:11,650 --> 02:32:13,515
That's as close as I can get.

2070
02:32:13,952 --> 02:32:17,479
You know,
it was probably a stupid thing to do...

2071
02:32:18,824 --> 02:32:23,761
not letting her play, but you can't be wise
and in love at the same time, so...

2072
02:32:25,330 --> 02:32:28,766
I hope she'd see the light
sooner or later on that.

2073
02:32:29,067 --> 02:32:32,332
Bob is one of the most complex
human beings I've ever met...

2074
02:32:33,372 --> 02:32:36,705
I think at first I really tried
to figure this guy out. No.

2075
02:32:37,743 --> 02:32:39,643
I gave it up, and so I don't know.

2076
02:32:39,745 --> 02:32:42,805
I don't know what he thought about,
all I know is what he gave us.

2077
02:32:42,915 --> 02:32:46,749
<i>The crash on the highway
threw the car into a field</i>

2078
02:32:47,986 --> 02:32:51,786
<i>Turn, turn, turn again</i>

2079
02:32:52,658 --> 02:32:56,617
<i>Four people killed with him at the wheel</i>

2080
02:32:57,696 --> 02:33:01,996
<i>Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind</i>

2081
02:33:04,169 --> 02:33:07,570
<i>The poetry, it tumbles out.
And I watched him write...</i>

2082
02:33:07,673 --> 02:33:10,164
<i>at the typewriter or writing... It's done.</i>

2083
02:33:10,309 --> 02:33:11,469
Do you remember that goddamn song?

2084
02:33:11,577 --> 02:33:14,239
<i>That love is just a four-letter word</i>

2085
02:33:14,346 --> 02:33:18,806
I never finished that song. Did I?
No, I never finished it.

2086
02:33:18,917 --> 02:33:19,975
Oh, God!

2087
02:33:20,085 --> 02:33:22,246
- You finished it about eight different ways.
- Did I?

2088
02:33:22,354 --> 02:33:26,757
<i>I stole Four Letter Word, I took that
and disappeared with it, and sang it...</i>

2089
02:33:27,392 --> 02:33:30,020
and I think the next Bob knew about it,
he heard it on the radio.

2090
02:33:30,128 --> 02:33:34,087
I was with him when he heard it
on the radio and he was listening, he said:

2091
02:33:34,199 --> 02:33:36,064
"That's a great song."

2092
02:33:36,168 --> 02:33:38,602
That's a great song.
He didn't remember he had written it.

2093
02:33:38,704 --> 02:33:41,298
I said, "You wrote it, you dope."

2094
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:41,807
<i>Strange it is to be beside you</i>

2095
02:33:41,807 --> 02:33:44,241
<i>Strange it is to be beside you</i>

2096
02:33:44,343 --> 02:33:46,709
<i>Many years of tables turned</i>

2097
02:33:47,579 --> 02:33:51,879
<i>You'd probably not believe me
if I told you all I've learned</i>

2098
02:33:52,918 --> 02:33:56,649
<i>And it is very very weird indeed</i>

2099
02:33:58,256 --> 02:34:02,590
<i>To hear words like forever and free</i>

2100
02:34:02,761 --> 02:34:06,925
<i>So ships run through my mind
I cannot cheat</i>

2101
02:34:08,667 --> 02:34:12,535
<i>It's like looking
in the teacher's face complete</i>

2102
02:34:13,972 --> 02:34:17,874
<i>I can say nothing to you but repeat</i>

2103
02:34:17,976 --> 02:34:21,571
<i>What I heard</i>

2104
02:34:21,947 --> 02:34:24,814
<i>That love is just a four-letter</i>

2105
02:34:24,916 --> 02:34:27,441
<i>Love is just a four-letter</i>

2106
02:34:27,552 --> 02:34:31,613
<i>Love is just a four-letter word</i>

2107
02:34:37,562 --> 02:34:38,363
<i>Hey Mr. Tambourine Man</i>

2108
02:34:38,363 --> 02:34:41,423
<i>Hey Mr. Tambourine Man</i>

2109
02:34:41,633 --> 02:34:44,295
<i>Play a song for me</i>

2110
02:34:44,703 --> 02:34:46,603
<i>I'm not sleepy</i>

2111
02:34:46,705 --> 02:34:51,267
<i>And there ain't no place I'm going to</i>

2112
02:34:53,178 --> 02:34:56,204
<i>A lot of my songs, they were becoming
hits for other people.</i>

2113
02:34:56,314 --> 02:34:58,373
<i>There was, the Byrds had a big hit.</i>

2114
02:34:58,483 --> 02:35:00,974
<i>Some group called the Turtles had some hit.</i>

2115
02:35:01,353 --> 02:35:04,789
<i>Sonny and Cher had a hit
with a song of mine.</i>

2116
02:35:04,890 --> 02:35:07,256
<i>People were sort of writing
a jingly-jangly kind of song...</i>

2117
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:11,261
which seemed to have something to do
with me, I, you know, like, "okay..."

2118
02:35:11,897 --> 02:35:15,458
<i>You know, I Got Me, Babe, is some kind of
take-off of me, something I wrote.</i>

2119
02:35:15,567 --> 02:35:18,400
Well, I don't know what it was a take-off
on that I wrote, you know?

2120
02:35:18,503 --> 02:35:21,529
I didn't really like that sound...

2121
02:35:22,641 --> 02:35:26,077
<i>or folk-rock, whatever that was, I didn't feel
that had anything to do with me.</i>

2122
02:35:26,178 --> 02:35:29,170
<i>It got me thinking about the
Billboard charts and the songs...</i>

2123
02:35:29,281 --> 02:35:32,546
<i>which become popular,
which I hadn't thought of that before.</i>

2124
02:35:32,918 --> 02:35:35,352
<i>Once upon a time you dressed so fine</i>

2125
02:35:35,454 --> 02:35:39,515
<i>You threw the bums a dime
in your prime, didn't you?</i>

2126
02:35:42,427 --> 02:35:45,658
<i>I found myself writing this song, this story...</i>

2127
02:35:46,565 --> 02:35:51,093
<i>this long piece of vomit,
20 pages long, and out of it...</i>

2128
02:35:51,603 --> 02:35:55,471
<i>I took Like A Rolling Stone,
and made it as a single...</i>

2129
02:35:55,574 --> 02:35:57,838
<i>and I'd never written
anything like that before.</i>

2130
02:35:57,943 --> 02:36:01,777
<i>And it suddenly came to me
that was what I should do.</i>

2131
02:36:02,214 --> 02:36:07,117
<i>After writing that, I wasn't interested
in writing a novel or a play or anything.</i>

2132
02:36:07,219 --> 02:36:10,279
<i>Like I knew I just had too much,
I wanted to write songs.</i>

2133
02:36:10,388 --> 02:36:12,413
<i>About having to scrounge</i>

2134
02:36:13,024 --> 02:36:17,757
<i>Your next meal</i>

2135
02:36:28,073 --> 02:36:31,008
Mike Bloomfield said he had heard
my first record...

2136
02:36:32,244 --> 02:36:35,475
and said he wanted to show me
how the blues were played...

2137
02:36:35,781 --> 02:36:38,716
and I didn't feel much competitive...

2138
02:36:39,084 --> 02:36:43,680
I didn't feel much competitive with him,
he could outplay anybody, even at that...

2139
02:36:43,989 --> 02:36:46,583
at that point, you know.

2140
02:36:47,058 --> 02:36:51,085
But when it was time
to bring in a guitar player on my record...

2141
02:36:51,196 --> 02:36:53,357
I couldn't think of anybody but him.

2142
02:36:53,832 --> 02:36:56,460
I mean, he just was the best guitar player
I ever heard.

2143
02:36:56,568 --> 02:36:59,332
<i>Okay, Bob. We've got everybody here,
let's do one. And then...</i>

2144
02:36:59,437 --> 02:37:02,804
<i>A producer named Tom Wilson
invited me to a recording session.</i>

2145
02:37:03,108 --> 02:37:06,544
And me being 21 years old
and incredibly ambitious...

2146
02:37:06,645 --> 02:37:11,275
and a big Bob Dylan fan, I decided
I was going to play on that session.

2147
02:37:11,483 --> 02:37:15,214
<i>There was another guitar player
who sat down, and was warming up...</i>

2148
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:18,353
<i>and just was playing far beyond my abilities.</i>

2149
02:37:18,790 --> 02:37:21,122
<i>And he turned out to be Mike Bloomfield.</i>

2150
02:37:21,226 --> 02:37:25,890
<i>I packed up my guitar, and I went into
the control room where I belonged.</i>

2151
02:37:26,498 --> 02:37:30,491
After the first couple of hours
of the session, they moved...

2152
02:37:32,671 --> 02:37:34,935
the organ player over to piano.

2153
02:37:38,376 --> 02:37:40,970
And I said,
"Well, here's another chance for me."

2154
02:37:41,313 --> 02:37:43,508
So I said to Tom Wilson:

2155
02:37:44,816 --> 02:37:46,181
"Why don't you let me play the organ?

2156
02:37:46,284 --> 02:37:49,378
"I got a great part for this,"
which was total bullshit.

2157
02:37:53,124 --> 02:37:57,527
And Tom Wilson said,
"Oh, man, you don't play the organ.

2158
02:37:57,629 --> 02:37:59,290
"You're a guitar player."

2159
02:38:00,098 --> 02:38:02,623
I said, "I got a really good part for this,
I can play it."

2160
02:38:02,734 --> 02:38:04,634
He said, "Al."

2161
02:38:05,203 --> 02:38:08,331
And just then someone came and got him...

2162
02:38:08,707 --> 02:38:11,175
to take a phone call that came in for him.

2163
02:38:11,409 --> 02:38:13,070
So he didn't say no.

2164
02:38:13,478 --> 02:38:17,847
<i>Like a Rolling Stone, remake, Take One.</i>

2165
02:38:18,850 --> 02:38:20,545
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

2166
02:38:21,019 --> 02:38:25,422
<i>At that point,
he really could have just busted me...</i>

2167
02:38:25,523 --> 02:38:27,684
and got me back in the control room.

2168
02:38:29,227 --> 02:38:34,062
But he was a very gracious man.
And so he let it go.

2169
02:38:34,633 --> 02:38:36,396
<i>And so I began to play.</i>

2170
02:38:36,601 --> 02:38:38,899
<i>In the verses, in the beginning,
you hear me come in...</i>

2171
02:38:39,004 --> 02:38:41,472
<i>always an eighth note behind the band.</i>

2172
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:43,831
To make sure that I played the right chord...

2173
02:38:43,942 --> 02:38:46,706
the band would go... And I'd go like that.

2174
02:38:49,180 --> 02:38:50,238
Like that.

2175
02:38:50,348 --> 02:38:52,009
<i>They started playing it back.</i>

2176
02:38:52,117 --> 02:38:55,280
<i>After about a verse or two,
Bob said to Tom Wilson.;</i>

2177
02:38:55,787 --> 02:38:57,186
<i>"Hey, turn the organ up."</i>

2178
02:38:57,289 --> 02:39:01,487
<i>And Tom Wilson said to Bob,
"Oh, man, that guy's not an organ player.</i>

2179
02:39:01,593 --> 02:39:02,685
<i>"He's just..."</i>

2180
02:39:02,794 --> 02:39:05,729
And then Bob said,
"I don't care, turn the organ up."

2181
02:39:15,774 --> 02:39:20,438
<i>Once upon a time you dressed so fine
threw the bums a dime in your prime</i>

2182
02:39:21,913 --> 02:39:23,210
<i>didn't you?</i>

2183
02:39:25,984 --> 02:39:28,817
<i>People'd call, say,
"Beware doll, you're bound to fall"</i>

2184
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:32,412
<i>You thought they were all kidding you</i>

2185
02:39:36,661 --> 02:39:40,153
<i>You used to laugh about</i>

2186
02:39:41,700 --> 02:39:45,192
<i>Everybody that was hanging out</i>

2187
02:39:46,004 --> 02:39:49,201
<i>Now you don't talk so loud</i>

2188
02:39:50,842 --> 02:39:54,300
<i>Now you don't seem so proud</i>

2189
02:39:55,447 --> 02:39:57,711
<i>About having to be scrounging</i>

2190
02:39:58,984 --> 02:40:01,418
<i>your next meal</i>

2191
02:40:04,055 --> 02:40:05,955
<i>How does it feel</i>

2192
02:40:09,227 --> 02:40:10,785
<i>How does it feel</i>

2193
02:40:13,798 --> 02:40:15,857
<i>To be without a home</i>

2194
02:40:19,070 --> 02:40:21,197
<i>Like a complete unknown</i>

2195
02:40:23,408 --> 02:40:26,104
<i>Like a rolling stone</i>

2196
02:40:31,016 --> 02:40:33,450
<i>Like a Rolling Stone
definitely broke through somewhere.</i>

2197
02:40:33,551 --> 02:40:37,078
I didn't feel like radio had ever played
a song like that before.

2198
02:40:37,489 --> 02:40:39,753
I know I'd never heard
a song like that before.

2199
02:40:39,858 --> 02:40:41,086
So...

2200
02:40:42,394 --> 02:40:45,830
And everything I'd done up to that
point had led up to...

2201
02:40:46,131 --> 02:40:48,156
writing a song like that, just effortlessly.

2202
02:40:48,266 --> 02:40:52,396
<i>Like a Rolling Stone originally had
about 50-some verses, as I recall.</i>

2203
02:40:53,338 --> 02:40:56,068
And people who think it's long now,
you know...

2204
02:40:56,775 --> 02:40:58,936
should have had a look at it
when it was raw.

2205
02:40:59,044 --> 02:41:01,945
<i>I think he always made exactly the works
that he wanted to make...</i>

2206
02:41:02,047 --> 02:41:05,676
<i>At the time he wanted to make it.
The audience came to Bob.</i>

2207
02:41:05,917 --> 02:41:09,011
And that's one of the things
that makes him so unique...

2208
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:12,521
in the history of American music,
is the audience came to Bob Dylan.

2209
02:41:12,657 --> 02:41:14,090
I've never been that kind of performer...

2210
02:41:14,192 --> 02:41:18,060
that wants to be one of them, you know,
like one of the crowd.

2211
02:41:20,331 --> 02:41:22,595
I don't try to endear myself that way.

2212
02:41:22,934 --> 02:41:26,836
<i>Now, do performers look for applause?
Yeah, yes and no.</i>

2213
02:41:27,472 --> 02:41:29,599
<i>It really depends
what kind of performer you are.</i>

2214
02:41:29,707 --> 02:41:33,165
Like the story of Billie Holiday, you know...

2215
02:41:33,278 --> 02:41:36,577
<i>when she sang Strange Fruit
for the first time, nobody applauded.</i>

2216
02:41:36,681 --> 02:41:41,050
You know, you could leave somebody
kind of in a spellbound way and...

2217
02:41:43,354 --> 02:41:47,814
I don't know.
There's a lot of things going on...

2218
02:41:47,926 --> 02:41:50,918
when there's a performer on stage
and there's an audience out there.

2219
02:42:08,413 --> 02:42:10,381
<i>That weekend, my daughter had been born.</i>

2220
02:42:10,482 --> 02:42:13,974
<i>Pete Seeger had made a recording of her.
And he played it.</i>

2221
02:42:14,085 --> 02:42:15,985
<i>He opened the night on Sunday night
at Newport...</i>

2222
02:42:16,087 --> 02:42:18,351
<i>and he played this little recording
of a new baby, he says.;</i>

2223
02:42:18,456 --> 02:42:20,481
"Here's the first folk song, the first voice...

2224
02:42:20,592 --> 02:42:24,323
"and we're dedicating this festival
and this music and our purposes..."

2225
02:42:24,429 --> 02:42:28,160
"to this new child, and the new world
that she's going to grow up in."

2226
02:42:28,433 --> 02:42:32,301
And that was kind of, you know...
That's the way the evening began.

2227
02:42:32,837 --> 02:42:36,739
<i>I was walking around in the afternoon
and Albert Grossman took me aside...</i>

2228
02:42:36,841 --> 02:42:38,832
<i>and said, "Bob is looking for you."</i>

2229
02:42:39,744 --> 02:42:43,737
<i>And he took me to Bob and Bob said,
"I want to play Sunday night...</i>

2230
02:42:43,848 --> 02:42:46,851
<i>"and try and reproduce
what we did on the album. "</i>

2231
02:42:47,886 --> 02:42:49,080
And I said:

2232
02:42:49,787 --> 02:42:51,379
"Okay. Sounds great."

2233
02:42:52,056 --> 02:42:53,523
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

2234
02:42:55,093 --> 02:42:57,323
<i>the person that's going to come up now...</i>

2235
02:42:59,931 --> 02:43:02,126
<i>has a limited amount of time.</i>

2236
02:43:04,302 --> 02:43:07,533
<i>His name is Bob Dylan.</i>

2237
02:43:31,062 --> 02:43:34,623
<i>I ain't gonna work
on Maggie's farm no more</i>

2238
02:43:40,405 --> 02:43:44,205
<i>No, I ain't gonna work
on Maggie's farm no more</i>

2239
02:43:49,881 --> 02:43:53,578
<i>Well, I try my best to be just like I am</i>

2240
02:43:53,718 --> 02:43:57,085
<i>But everybody wants you to be
just like them</i>

2241
02:43:57,322 --> 02:44:00,450
<i>They say sing while you slave
I just get bored</i>

2242
02:44:00,992 --> 02:44:05,053
<i>I ain't gonna work
on Maggie's farm no more</i>

2243
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:15,237
<i>He sang that song, "I ain't going to work
on Maggie's farm no more. "</i>

2244
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:17,865
<i>I said, "Hey look,
he's taking that old Penny's Farm...</i>

2245
02:44:17,976 --> 02:44:21,036
"and putting it somewhere else.
That's terrific."

2246
02:44:21,145 --> 02:44:23,511
I thought that was interesting.

2247
02:44:24,382 --> 02:44:28,944
But the volume of the blues band
was kind of wild...

2248
02:44:29,087 --> 02:44:31,419
and you couldn't get the words too clearly.

2249
02:44:31,889 --> 02:44:35,848
<i>I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more</i>

2250
02:44:40,098 --> 02:44:43,932
<i>No, I ain't gonna work
for Maggie's ma no more</i>

2251
02:44:51,776 --> 02:44:56,042
<i>Well, she talks to all the servants
about man and God and law</i>

2252
02:44:56,247 --> 02:44:59,808
<i>Everybody says she's the brains behind pa</i>

2253
02:44:59,917 --> 02:45:02,852
<i>She's 72 but she says she's 24</i>

2254
02:45:04,289 --> 02:45:07,816
<i>I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more</i>

2255
02:45:11,195 --> 02:45:14,756
<i>It was not possible
to share the kind of intimacy...</i>

2256
02:45:14,866 --> 02:45:16,356
that we were sharing with folk music...

2257
02:45:16,467 --> 02:45:19,197
when you've got
those electric instruments going.

2258
02:45:19,304 --> 02:45:23,240
The moment you've got drums there,
everything has got to come up in level.

2259
02:45:28,613 --> 02:45:30,080
<i>The sound was a bit harsh.</i>

2260
02:45:30,181 --> 02:45:32,274
But we thought it was way cool.

2261
02:45:32,583 --> 02:45:34,278
And what we noticed was...

2262
02:45:35,653 --> 02:45:39,282
about a third of the audience
was booing, which was unheard of...

2263
02:45:39,390 --> 02:45:41,290
not in all our days of seeing...

2264
02:45:41,392 --> 02:45:43,883
whatever kind of show
had we ever seen that.

2265
02:45:46,164 --> 02:45:50,225
<i>I remember understanding
that drugs were bad and alcohol was bad...</i>

2266
02:45:50,501 --> 02:45:54,028
and rock 'n' roll was wicked
and sex was bad.

2267
02:45:54,205 --> 02:45:58,835
And so I thought, "Oh, my goodness,
how depraved this is all getting."

2268
02:45:58,943 --> 02:46:00,001
<i>All right!</i>

2269
02:46:01,646 --> 02:46:05,707
I was thinking that somebody was shouting,
"Are you with us? Are you with us?"

2270
02:46:06,050 --> 02:46:09,281
And, you know,
I don't know what that, you know, like...

2271
02:46:09,387 --> 02:46:10,854
What was that supposed to mean?

2272
02:46:10,955 --> 02:46:12,752
<i>I had no idea why they were booing.</i>

2273
02:46:12,857 --> 02:46:17,760
I don't think anybody was there
having a negative response to those...

2274
02:46:18,563 --> 02:46:19,757
songs, though.

2275
02:46:20,798 --> 02:46:24,529
I mean, whatever it was about,
it wasn't about...

2276
02:46:24,869 --> 02:46:26,860
anything that they were hearing.

2277
02:46:27,004 --> 02:46:30,838
<i>Well, he hands you a nickel
Hands you a dime</i>

2278
02:46:31,409 --> 02:46:34,901
<i>Asks you with a grin
if you're having a good time</i>

2279
02:46:35,046 --> 02:46:37,879
<i>And he fines you every time
you slam the door</i>

2280
02:46:38,549 --> 02:46:42,508
<i>I ain't gonna work
for Maggie's brother no more</i>

2281
02:46:42,987 --> 02:46:44,921
You could not understand the words.

2282
02:46:45,022 --> 02:46:48,617
And I was frantic.
I said, "Get that distortion out."

2283
02:46:48,726 --> 02:46:52,457
It was so raspy,
you could not understand a word.

2284
02:46:52,897 --> 02:46:56,560
And I ran over to the sound system,
"Get that distortion out of Bob's voice."

2285
02:46:56,667 --> 02:46:59,033
"No, this is the way they want to have it."

2286
02:46:59,137 --> 02:47:02,038
I said, "God damn it, it's terrible.
You can't understand it.

2287
02:47:02,140 --> 02:47:05,632
"If I had an axe,
I'd chop the mike cable right now."

2288
02:47:06,411 --> 02:47:10,347
<i>Oh, you've gone to the finest school
all right, Miss Lonely</i>

2289
02:47:10,448 --> 02:47:14,043
<i>but you know you only used to get
juiced in it</i>

2290
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:19,481
<i>Nobody's ever taught you how to live
out on the street</i>

2291
02:47:19,590 --> 02:47:22,423
<i>And now you're gonna have to get used to it</i>

2292
02:47:25,329 --> 02:47:28,162
<i>We ran backstage and there was
mayhem going on.</i>

2293
02:47:28,266 --> 02:47:31,133
<i>Pete Seeger and Theodore Bikel
and all the old guard...</i>

2294
02:47:31,235 --> 02:47:34,466
<i>the old leftist, protest-singing factions...</i>

2295
02:47:34,572 --> 02:47:38,736
were horrified and thought:
"This is pop music, this isn't folk music."

2296
02:47:38,843 --> 02:47:42,176
And there was just a big battle
raging backstage and...

2297
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:44,942
Pete, I understand Pete Seeger had an axe...

2298
02:47:45,049 --> 02:47:48,678
and was going to go cut the electric cables
and had to be...

2299
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:51,286
you know, subdued...

2300
02:47:51,556 --> 02:47:55,959
and Theodore Bikel was saying,
"This is what the young people want!

2301
02:47:56,060 --> 02:47:59,120
"We have to go with the change,
this is what's happening now."

2302
02:47:59,230 --> 02:48:00,822
So they were all arguing among themselves.

2303
02:48:00,932 --> 02:48:02,593
Seeger...

2304
02:48:03,935 --> 02:48:08,065
from all reports, was very upset by this.

2305
02:48:08,172 --> 02:48:12,506
And I had heard that he tried to cut
the wires and that he'd gone into a car...

2306
02:48:12,610 --> 02:48:15,238
and wouldn't come out
after this whole thing.

2307
02:48:15,346 --> 02:48:17,678
That's not my interpretation. You see...

2308
02:48:18,015 --> 02:48:21,382
Pete's father was there, Charlie Seeger...

2309
02:48:21,752 --> 02:48:25,210
and he had a hearing aid,
and Charlie was very distressed...

2310
02:48:25,423 --> 02:48:27,584
when he couldn't hear things clearly.

2311
02:48:27,692 --> 02:48:30,252
And with all this sound coming
from the speakers...

2312
02:48:30,361 --> 02:48:34,058
Charlie Seeger was quite upset.
And I think that affected Pete.

2313
02:48:34,298 --> 02:48:37,529
<i>You used to ride the chrome horse
with your diplomat</i>

2314
02:48:38,503 --> 02:48:41,961
<i>Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat</i>

2315
02:48:43,107 --> 02:48:45,905
<i>Ain't it hard when you discover that</i>

2316
02:48:47,411 --> 02:48:50,903
<i>He really wasn't where it's at</i>

2317
02:48:51,983 --> 02:48:54,281
<i>After he's taken from you</i>

2318
02:48:54,385 --> 02:48:57,548
<i>everything he could steal</i>

2319
02:48:59,423 --> 02:49:01,448
<i>How does it feel?</i>

2320
02:49:01,959 --> 02:49:06,419
<i>Rock 'n' roll was considered
a real sellout music for a lot of folk fans...</i>

2321
02:49:06,531 --> 02:49:10,262
<i>and Like a Rolling Stone seemed like
the direct slap in the face...</i>

2322
02:49:10,368 --> 02:49:12,768
<i>to everything that topical songs represented.</i>

2323
02:49:13,037 --> 02:49:16,768
"How does it feel to be on your own."
And they took it as this most...

2324
02:49:17,008 --> 02:49:18,942
extremely negative...

2325
02:49:21,012 --> 02:49:22,309
you know...

2326
02:49:22,413 --> 02:49:25,940
selfish statement, basically,
and it was, you know, it was not...

2327
02:49:26,350 --> 02:49:28,841
<i>Better World A-Coming, you know,
it was not that.</i>

2328
02:49:35,560 --> 02:49:37,221
<i>Let's go, man. That's all.</i>

2329
02:49:37,728 --> 02:49:41,687
<i>I thought he would go out and play
some other stuff by himself and then...</i>

2330
02:49:42,133 --> 02:49:44,499
<i>we'd come out and play these three songs.</i>

2331
02:49:46,804 --> 02:49:49,967
<i>But we just came out
and played these three songs and then...</i>

2332
02:49:50,207 --> 02:49:51,674
he said, "Goodnight."

2333
02:49:51,976 --> 02:49:56,003
And we'd been out there
for a total of 15 minutes...

2334
02:49:57,515 --> 02:49:59,983
and everybody else had played for an hour.

2335
02:50:00,818 --> 02:50:03,446
So that was pretty weird.
And he was the headliner.

2336
02:50:07,258 --> 02:50:09,488
<i>Bobby, can you do another song, please?</i>

2337
02:50:11,195 --> 02:50:12,890
<i>He's going to get his axe.</i>

2338
02:50:20,638 --> 02:50:21,764
<i>He's coming.</i>

2339
02:50:24,375 --> 02:50:27,867
Bobby was terribly shaken
and I ran backstage...

2340
02:50:28,546 --> 02:50:31,071
and he said to me,
"What have you done to me?"

2341
02:50:31,449 --> 02:50:34,885
Peter Yarrow came out and said,
"Okay, everybody calm down...

2342
02:50:34,986 --> 02:50:37,648
"Bob's gone to get his acoustic guitar."

2343
02:50:37,755 --> 02:50:39,017
And everybody...

2344
02:50:39,490 --> 02:50:42,721
<i>The highway is for gamblers</i>

2345
02:50:43,094 --> 02:50:45,289
<i>better use your sense</i>

2346
02:50:49,567 --> 02:50:52,058
<i>Take what you have gathered</i>

2347
02:50:52,169 --> 02:50:55,104
<i>from coincidence</i>

2348
02:50:58,709 --> 02:51:03,408
<i>The empty-handed painter from your streets</i>

2349
02:51:06,417 --> 02:51:09,580
<i>Is drawing crazy patterns</i>

2350
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:11,483
<i>on your sheets</i>

2351
02:51:14,225 --> 02:51:17,991
<i>The sky, too, is folding over you</i>

2352
02:51:21,599 --> 02:51:24,762
<i>And it's all over now</i>

2353
02:51:24,869 --> 02:51:26,860
<i>Baby Blue</i>

2354
02:51:31,676 --> 02:51:33,974
I'd heard a rumor that
Pete was going to cut the cable.

2355
02:51:34,078 --> 02:51:38,344
And I heard it later, you know.
And it was like, it didn't make sense to me.

2356
02:51:38,683 --> 02:51:42,676
Like, Pete Seeger, like someone
whose music I cherish, you know.

2357
02:51:42,787 --> 02:51:45,381
Like someone who I highly respect
is going to cut the cable.

2358
02:51:45,489 --> 02:51:47,889
It was like, "Oh, God." It was like...

2359
02:51:48,659 --> 02:51:50,991
It was like a dagger, you know, it was...

2360
02:51:51,328 --> 02:51:53,853
Just the thought of it was, you know...

2361
02:51:54,565 --> 02:51:55,998
made me go out and get drunk.

2362
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:58,500
<i>Strike another match</i>

2363
02:51:58,602 --> 02:52:01,366
<i>Go start anew</i>

2364
02:52:03,574 --> 02:52:06,702
<i>And it's all over now</i>

2365
02:52:06,911 --> 02:52:08,845
<i>Baby Blue</i>

2366
02:52:34,004 --> 02:52:36,404
<i>I remember seeing Bob
later on that evening...</i>

2367
02:52:36,507 --> 02:52:38,907
<i>Iooking kind of blue, as though he hadn't...</i>

2368
02:52:39,009 --> 02:52:41,978
<i>Hadn't made the point
that he wanted to make properly.</i>

2369
02:52:42,079 --> 02:52:46,982
He didn't want to feel that he was
limited here or limited there.

2370
02:52:47,184 --> 02:52:50,813
He wanted to do something
with the Butterfield Blues Band.

2371
02:52:51,122 --> 02:52:52,783
And it was great.

2372
02:52:53,524 --> 02:52:57,620
<i>Every night, after the concerts,
the festival people would have a party.</i>

2373
02:52:57,795 --> 02:53:01,731
<i>And Bob was sitting in the corner,
I guess, thinking about what had happened.</i>

2374
02:53:01,832 --> 02:53:05,666
I said, "Hey, Bob. Do you want to dance?"
And he looked up at me and said:

2375
02:53:06,270 --> 02:53:09,728
"I'd dance with you, Maria,
but my hands are on fire."

2376
02:53:10,674 --> 02:53:15,202
And it's sort of like... That was
a cryptic remark, but I kind of knew...

2377
02:53:15,312 --> 02:53:19,442
exactly what he meant, you know. So I said,
"Okay, man," and I just left him alone.

2378
02:53:20,117 --> 02:53:23,575
<i>We want Dylan!</i>

2379
02:53:27,625 --> 02:53:30,185
<i>A couple of months later,
he played Forest Hills.</i>

2380
02:53:30,294 --> 02:53:34,025
<i>There, the first half was acoustic,
the second half was rock 'n' roll.</i>

2381
02:53:34,131 --> 02:53:37,430
<i>The electric half.; silence, booing.</i>

2382
02:53:37,668 --> 02:53:41,729
At least 15, 20 kids ran on the stage
through the whole electric set.

2383
02:53:41,839 --> 02:53:44,137
There would be somebody,
two, three times during a number...

2384
02:53:44,241 --> 02:53:48,177
actually jumping on the stage
and running around amongst the musicians.

2385
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:52,576
And an incredible animosity in the audience.

2386
02:53:52,683 --> 02:53:55,481
I think it was the only concert
I have ever been at where...

2387
02:53:55,586 --> 02:53:59,682
that animosity was that strong
and you actually felt a little threatened...

2388
02:53:59,790 --> 02:54:02,418
if you applauded during this, which I did.

2389
02:54:02,626 --> 02:54:06,426
<i>When we played Forest Hills,
Like a Rolling Stone was number one.</i>

2390
02:54:08,165 --> 02:54:10,156
<i>And so when we played
Like a Rolling Stone...</i>

2391
02:54:10,267 --> 02:54:12,132
they stopped booing and sang along.

2392
02:54:12,236 --> 02:54:14,761
And then when we finished
they started booing again.

2393
02:54:14,872 --> 02:54:16,567
I thought that was great.

2394
02:54:16,740 --> 02:54:19,538
I enjoyed that.
But at the party after the show...

2395
02:54:19,643 --> 02:54:23,101
<i>Bob came running up to us
and gave us big hugs, he said.;</i>

2396
02:54:23,714 --> 02:54:27,013
<i>"That was fabulous. It was great.
It was like a carnival. "</i>

2397
02:54:27,117 --> 02:54:30,177
It was fantastic. He really enjoyed the show.

2398
02:54:30,721 --> 02:54:35,158
The booing didn't really, you know...
I had a perspective on the booing.

2399
02:54:35,726 --> 02:54:40,186
Because you got to realize
you can kill somebody with kindness, too.

2400
02:54:47,137 --> 02:54:50,538
<i>God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"</i>

2401
02:54:50,674 --> 02:54:53,609
<i>Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on"</i>

2402
02:54:54,245 --> 02:54:57,112
<i>God say, "No" Abe say, "What?"</i>

2403
02:54:57,514 --> 02:55:00,381
<i>God say,
"You can do what you want, Abe, but</i>

2404
02:55:01,018 --> 02:55:04,044
<i>"Next time you see me coming
you better run"</i>

2405
02:55:10,194 --> 02:55:13,652
<i>Well, Abe says,
"Where do you want this killing done?"</i>

2406
02:55:13,797 --> 02:55:17,164
<i>God says, "Out on Highway 61"</i>

2407
02:55:17,434 --> 02:55:20,232
I walked in the studio
and he was out there in a corner...

2408
02:55:20,337 --> 02:55:22,100
and I walked up and I said,
"Bob, I'm Bob Johnston."

2409
02:55:22,206 --> 02:55:24,003
<i>He said, "How you doing?"
And he smiled at me.</i>

2410
02:55:24,108 --> 02:55:27,703
All I remember is Dylan doing that
and starting in...

2411
02:55:28,178 --> 02:55:31,443
and from that moment,
I really have no memory.

2412
02:55:32,983 --> 02:55:34,473
Nobody ever counted off for Dylan...

2413
02:55:34,585 --> 02:55:36,519
he always did what the fuck he wanted to.

2414
02:55:36,620 --> 02:55:40,750
And I always just got the sound pretty well.
And he seemed to love the sound.

2415
02:55:41,058 --> 02:55:46,121
<i>You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand</i>

2416
02:55:47,431 --> 02:55:52,459
<i>You see somebody naked
And you say, "Who is that man?"</i>

2417
02:55:53,304 --> 02:55:56,034
I was just caught in this whirlwind of...

2418
02:55:56,840 --> 02:56:01,777
You know, of being tacked on to this music
that was going to be forever...

2419
02:56:02,246 --> 02:56:06,376
and being involved in it.
And knowing that it was going to be forever.

2420
02:56:06,483 --> 02:56:09,077
<i>Because something is happening here</i>

2421
02:56:09,186 --> 02:56:12,349
<i>But you don't know what it is</i>

2422
02:56:13,524 --> 02:56:17,221
<i>The music actually changed by,
I think, the word is freedom.</i>

2423
02:56:17,328 --> 02:56:20,388
Everything was changing.
It wasn't like four songs a session.

2424
02:56:20,497 --> 02:56:23,057
There wasn't any clock.
I took all the clocks down.

2425
02:56:23,167 --> 02:56:24,828
Nobody had a fucking clock in there.

2426
02:56:24,935 --> 02:56:28,598
It's just like, "Play some music."
"What about this thing? What about this?"

2427
02:56:28,706 --> 02:56:31,675
<i>We're recording 86845. Number one.</i>

2428
02:56:31,775 --> 02:56:35,176
<i>Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood</i>

2429
02:56:36,313 --> 02:56:40,113
<i>With his memories in his trunk</i>

2430
02:56:42,086 --> 02:56:45,920
<i>Passed this way an hour ago</i>

2431
02:56:46,123 --> 02:56:49,524
<i>With his friend, a jealous monk</i>

2432
02:56:51,662 --> 02:56:55,120
<i>I believe in giving credit where credit's due.</i>

2433
02:56:55,232 --> 02:56:57,530
<i>I don't think Dylan had a lot to do with it.</i>

2434
02:56:57,634 --> 02:57:01,866
I think God,
instead of touching him on the shoulder...

2435
02:57:01,972 --> 02:57:04,406
he kicked him in the ass. Really!

2436
02:57:04,641 --> 02:57:08,634
And that's where all that came from.
He can't help what he's doing.

2437
02:57:08,879 --> 02:57:11,939
I mean, he's got the Holy Spirit about him.

2438
02:57:12,049 --> 02:57:14,142
You can look at him and tell that.

2439
02:57:23,761 --> 02:57:26,195
<i>Well, I ride a mailtrain, baby</i>

2440
02:57:26,697 --> 02:57:29,325
<i>Can't buy no thrill</i>

2441
02:57:30,067 --> 02:57:32,865
<i>It Takes a Lot to Laugh,
It Takes a Train to Cry.</i>

2442
02:57:33,003 --> 02:57:35,938
In fact, there was two versions of that cut.
The first version...

2443
02:57:36,040 --> 02:57:38,099
which turned up on bootlegs,
it was like a fast...

2444
02:57:38,208 --> 02:57:41,200
It was a much faster
and much more jivey version...

2445
02:57:41,311 --> 02:57:44,747
that sounded kind of a lot
like the other things that had been done.

2446
02:57:46,383 --> 02:57:49,409
<i>What the fuck
are we doing with this song, man?</i>

2447
02:57:49,553 --> 02:57:51,714
<i>It's not such a terrible song to do.</i>

2448
02:57:51,822 --> 02:57:53,380
Then he said, "Let's take a break."

2449
02:57:53,490 --> 02:57:56,584
And he sent everybody off. And he said
it was a lunch break or whatever.

2450
02:57:56,693 --> 02:57:58,558
People went out for an hour.

2451
02:57:58,662 --> 02:58:01,631
He was sitting alone
at the piano working over...

2452
02:58:01,899 --> 02:58:04,834
just play a few chords
and he'd scribble something down.

2453
02:58:04,935 --> 02:58:07,563
And they came back
and they did that other take...

2454
02:58:07,671 --> 02:58:11,072
after the lunch break and it was,
like the much slower, bluesier version...

2455
02:58:11,175 --> 02:58:13,871
you hear on the album,
and it's really changed the whole character...

2456
02:58:13,977 --> 02:58:16,002
and the feel of the song.
It was really, really nice.

2457
02:58:25,355 --> 02:58:28,722
<i>Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby</i>

2458
02:58:29,560 --> 02:58:32,120
<i>Can't buy a thrill</i>

2459
02:58:35,866 --> 02:58:38,096
<i>I'd like to know about
the cover of your album.</i>

2460
02:58:38,202 --> 02:58:39,794
I'd like to know about...

2461
02:58:39,903 --> 02:58:43,999
the meaning of the photograph of you
and the wearing of the Triumph t-shirt.

2462
02:58:44,675 --> 02:58:45,903
What did you want to know about it?

2463
02:58:46,009 --> 02:58:48,500
Well, I'd like to know if
that's an equivalent photograph...

2464
02:58:48,612 --> 02:58:51,308
it means something.
It's got a philosophy in it.

2465
02:58:53,383 --> 02:58:56,284
And I'd like to know,
visually, what it represents to you.

2466
02:58:56,386 --> 02:58:58,616
Because you're a part of that.

2467
02:59:03,861 --> 02:59:06,523
I haven't really looked at it that much.
I don't really...

2468
02:59:06,630 --> 02:59:08,757
I've thought about it a great deal.

2469
02:59:09,533 --> 02:59:12,730
It was just taken one day,
when I was sitting on the steps, you know.

2470
02:59:12,836 --> 02:59:16,272
I don't really remember.

2471
02:59:16,373 --> 02:59:18,238
I don't worry too much about it.

2472
02:59:18,342 --> 02:59:21,834
But what about the motorcycle
as an image in your songwriting?

2473
02:59:22,112 --> 02:59:23,306
You seem to like that.

2474
02:59:23,413 --> 02:59:27,645
- Oh, we all like motorcycles to some degree.
- I do.

2475
02:59:29,019 --> 02:59:31,988
Do you prefer songs with a subtle
or obvious message?

2476
02:59:32,189 --> 02:59:35,158
- With a what?
- A subtle or obvious message.

2477
02:59:35,259 --> 02:59:38,251
With a message, you mean like...
What song with a message?

2478
02:59:38,362 --> 02:59:41,820
<i>Well like Eve of Destruction
and things like that.</i>

2479
02:59:44,701 --> 02:59:46,566
Do I prefer that to what?

2480
02:59:47,538 --> 02:59:50,405
I don't know, but your songs
are supposed to have a subtle message.

2481
02:59:50,507 --> 02:59:53,374
- A subtle message?
- Well, they're supposed to.

2482
02:59:56,313 --> 02:59:58,474
Where'd you hear that?

2483
03:00:00,150 --> 03:00:02,482
- In a movie magazine.
- Oh, my God!

2484
03:00:05,822 --> 03:00:09,121
Do you think of yourself primarily
as a singer or as a poet?

2485
03:00:09,726 --> 03:00:12,820
I think of myself more
as a song-and-dance man, you know.

2486
03:00:14,865 --> 03:00:18,323
Mr. Dylan, I know you dislike labels
and probably rightly so...

2487
03:00:18,435 --> 03:00:21,427
but for those of us who are well over 30...

2488
03:00:22,005 --> 03:00:26,408
could you label yourself
and perhaps tell us what your role is?

2489
03:00:29,012 --> 03:00:31,537
Well, I sort of label myself as well under 30.

2490
03:00:35,385 --> 03:00:39,845
And my role is to, you know,
to just stay here as long as I can.

2491
03:00:43,660 --> 03:00:45,685
You're considered by many people to be...

2492
03:00:45,796 --> 03:00:48,629
symbolic of the protest movement
in the country...

2493
03:00:48,966 --> 03:00:49,933
for the young people.

2494
03:00:49,933 --> 03:00:50,399
For the young people.

2495
03:00:50,500 --> 03:00:52,161
Are you going to participate in...

2496
03:00:52,269 --> 03:00:56,137
the Vietnam Day Committee demonstration in
front of the Paramount Hotel tonight?

2497
03:00:56,240 --> 03:00:57,730
I'll be busy tonight.

2498
03:01:00,911 --> 03:01:02,105
<i>Things had gotten out of hand.</i>

2499
03:01:02,279 --> 03:01:05,180
You know, it fell into the...

2500
03:01:05,282 --> 03:01:07,682
You know,
you ask me why I write surreal songs...

2501
03:01:07,784 --> 03:01:12,153
or whatever,
I mean that type of activity is surreal.

2502
03:01:12,256 --> 03:01:14,190
I had no answers
to any of those questions...

2503
03:01:14,291 --> 03:01:16,816
any more than
any other performer did, really.

2504
03:01:17,661 --> 03:01:22,121
But, you know, that didn't stop...

2505
03:01:22,366 --> 03:01:24,834
the press or people or whoever they were...

2506
03:01:25,402 --> 03:01:28,929
from asking these questions.
They, for some reason the press thought...

2507
03:01:29,039 --> 03:01:32,133
that performers had the answers
to all these...

2508
03:01:32,809 --> 03:01:34,777
problems in the society and...

2509
03:01:36,046 --> 03:01:37,877
you know, like what can...

2510
03:01:38,348 --> 03:01:42,114
What can you say to something like that?
I mean, it's just kind of absurd.

2511
03:01:43,020 --> 03:01:46,251
<i>Phil Ochs wrote something
in a recent Broadside Magazine...</i>

2512
03:01:46,356 --> 03:01:47,880
to the effect that...

2513
03:01:47,991 --> 03:01:51,688
you have twisted so many people's wigs
that he feels that it becomes...

2514
03:01:51,795 --> 03:01:56,027
increasingly dangerous for you
to perform in public before an audience.

2515
03:01:57,701 --> 03:02:00,898
Well, that's the way it goes, you know.

2516
03:02:03,640 --> 03:02:06,768
I can't apologize, certainly.

2517
03:02:07,477 --> 03:02:11,607
Do you feel that part of the popularity
is because of an identification...

2518
03:02:11,915 --> 03:02:14,509
of your audience with you or with...

2519
03:02:14,618 --> 03:02:17,143
what you're saying
or what you've been writing about?

2520
03:02:17,254 --> 03:02:18,516
I have no idea.

2521
03:02:18,955 --> 03:02:21,651
Mr. Dylan, you seem very reluctant
to talk about the fact...

2522
03:02:21,758 --> 03:02:24,750
that you're a popular entertainer,
and you're a most popular entertainer.

2523
03:02:24,861 --> 03:02:27,421
- What do you want me to say?
- Well, I don't understand why you...

2524
03:02:27,531 --> 03:02:30,830
Well, what do you want me to say about it?

2525
03:02:30,934 --> 03:02:34,267
Well, you seem almost embarrassed
to admit that you're... To talk about...

2526
03:02:34,371 --> 03:02:36,430
Well, I'm not embarrassed,
I mean, you know.

2527
03:02:36,540 --> 03:02:38,440
What do you want exactly for me to say?

2528
03:02:38,542 --> 03:02:41,534
Do you want me to jump up and say,
"Hallelujah" and crash the cameras...

2529
03:02:41,645 --> 03:02:44,443
and do something weird? Tell me.

2530
03:02:45,082 --> 03:02:46,242
I'll go along with you.

2531
03:02:46,350 --> 03:02:49,148
If I can't go along with you,
I'll find somebody to go along with you.

2532
03:02:49,252 --> 03:02:52,153
No, but I find that...
You really have no idea...

2533
03:02:52,255 --> 03:02:54,723
as to why,
or no thoughts on why you're popular?

2534
03:02:54,825 --> 03:02:56,759
- That's what interests me.
- I just have...

2535
03:02:56,860 --> 03:03:00,557
I haven't really struggled for that. I don't...

2536
03:03:01,064 --> 03:03:02,554
It happened, you know.

2537
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,332
It happened like anything else happens.

2538
03:03:07,738 --> 03:03:09,899
<i>How many people who labor...</i>

2539
03:03:10,006 --> 03:03:13,237
<i>in the same musical vineyard
in which you toil...</i>

2540
03:03:13,343 --> 03:03:15,243
<i>how many are protest singers?</i>

2541
03:03:15,345 --> 03:03:19,975
<i>That is, people who use their music
and use the songs...</i>

2542
03:03:20,384 --> 03:03:24,821
<i>to protest the social state
in which we live today.</i>

2543
03:03:24,921 --> 03:03:28,357
<i>The matter of war, the matter of crime,
or whatever it might be.</i>

2544
03:03:29,259 --> 03:03:30,749
<i>- How many?
- Yes.</i>

2545
03:03:30,894 --> 03:03:32,418
<i>- Are there many who...
- Yeah.</i>

2546
03:03:32,529 --> 03:03:35,726
<i>I think there's about 136.</i>

2547
03:03:37,501 --> 03:03:39,799
<i>- You say, "about 136"?
- Yeah.</i>

2548
03:03:41,304 --> 03:03:43,272
<i>Or do you mean exactly 136?</i>

2549
03:03:44,741 --> 03:03:47,505
<i>It's either 136 or 142.</i>

2550
03:03:47,911 --> 03:03:52,245
<i>At a certain point, people seemed to have
a distorted, warped view of me...</i>

2551
03:03:52,349 --> 03:03:55,546
<i>for some reason,
and those people were usually...</i>

2552
03:03:55,652 --> 03:03:57,279
<i>outside of the musical community.</i>

2553
03:03:57,387 --> 03:03:59,355
<i>"The spokesman of the generation."</i>

2554
03:03:59,456 --> 03:04:02,323
"The conscience of a..."
This, and that and the other.

2555
03:04:02,426 --> 03:04:06,692
That I could not relate to.
I just couldn't relate to it.

2556
03:04:07,164 --> 03:04:10,099
<i>As long as I could continue doing
what it is that I loved to do...</i>

2557
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:12,430
<i>I didn't care
what kinds of labels were put on me...</i>

2558
03:04:12,536 --> 03:04:16,563
<i>or how I was perceived in the press
because I was playing to people every night.</i>

2559
03:04:23,947 --> 03:04:26,142
<i>I played at the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

2560
03:04:26,516 --> 03:04:29,144
Then I left the organization.

2561
03:04:29,386 --> 03:04:33,584
<i>I actually was frightened
when I got the tour itinerary...</i>

2562
03:04:33,690 --> 03:04:35,851
to see that we were
going to play Dallas where...

2563
03:04:35,959 --> 03:04:37,790
they had just killed the President.

2564
03:04:38,628 --> 03:04:40,721
And I thought, you know:
"If they didn't like that guy...

2565
03:04:40,831 --> 03:04:43,595
"what are they going to think of this guy?"

2566
03:04:43,700 --> 03:04:46,294
And I didn't want to,
you know, I didn't want to be...

2567
03:04:46,403 --> 03:04:49,861
the analogy to John Connally.

2568
03:04:50,340 --> 03:04:52,706
<i>I didn't want to be the guy next to him.</i>

2569
03:04:53,009 --> 03:04:57,742
<i>I started out on Burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff</i>

2570
03:05:01,017 --> 03:05:04,646
<i>Everybody said they'd stand behind me</i>

2571
03:05:04,754 --> 03:05:07,746
<i>When the game got rough</i>

2572
03:05:08,859 --> 03:05:11,987
<i>The guys that were with me on that tour,
which later became The Band...</i>

2573
03:05:12,095 --> 03:05:14,120
<i>you know, we were all in it together.</i>

2574
03:05:14,231 --> 03:05:16,722
<i>We were putting our heads
in the lion's mouth and...</i>

2575
03:05:16,833 --> 03:05:19,233
<i>I had to admire them for
sticking it out with me.</i>

2576
03:05:19,336 --> 03:05:22,999
Just for doing it, in my book, they were,
you know, gallant knights for even...

2577
03:05:23,106 --> 03:05:24,937
you know, standing behind me.

2578
03:05:25,075 --> 03:05:28,533
<i>By the time we got to England,
it was out of control.</i>

2579
03:05:29,012 --> 03:05:31,173
And I don't know if word of mouth...

2580
03:05:31,948 --> 03:05:34,143
preceded our concert tour...

2581
03:05:38,455 --> 03:05:42,186
but it really was pretty revolutionary,
in the fact that...

2582
03:05:42,425 --> 03:05:44,859
here was someone who everyone loved...

2583
03:05:45,495 --> 03:05:47,827
and they didn't like what he was doing.

2584
03:05:48,265 --> 03:05:49,960
And they were showing it.

2585
03:05:50,400 --> 03:05:52,800
<i>These stages were created for people
who stood on stage...</i>

2586
03:05:52,903 --> 03:05:55,201
<i>and recited Shakespearean plays.</i>

2587
03:05:55,305 --> 03:05:57,500
<i>They weren't made for this kind of music
we were playing.</i>

2588
03:05:57,607 --> 03:06:00,235
<i>The sound was pretty archaic, really.</i>

2589
03:06:00,577 --> 03:06:04,877
The sound really hadn't been perfected.
The sound quality hadn't been perfected...

2590
03:06:05,181 --> 03:06:06,307
many years after that.

2591
03:06:06,483 --> 03:06:09,646
<i>The first half of the concert
was Bob Dylan alone...</i>

2592
03:06:09,853 --> 03:06:11,480
<i>acoustic and harmonica.</i>

2593
03:06:11,888 --> 03:06:16,416
When we kicked off the second half,
I mean, we did kick ass and take names.

2594
03:06:17,027 --> 03:06:20,326
And we got everyone in there's attention.

2595
03:06:20,564 --> 03:06:22,259
They knew that we had arrived.

2596
03:06:22,532 --> 03:06:25,433
<i>Because they were such fans of his
acoustic set...</i>

2597
03:06:25,735 --> 03:06:27,896
<i>that when we came in
and did the electric set...</i>

2598
03:06:28,004 --> 03:06:30,063
<i>people have said the word to me that...</i>

2599
03:06:30,907 --> 03:06:34,399
he was a traitor to folk music.
The pure music.

2600
03:06:34,778 --> 03:06:37,576
And I'd just about had it, though.
I'd had it with the...

2601
03:06:37,681 --> 03:06:39,171
with the whole scene.

2602
03:06:39,916 --> 03:06:43,977
And I was... Whether I knew it
or didn't know it, I was looking...

2603
03:06:44,087 --> 03:06:45,748
to just quit for a while.

2604
03:06:46,523 --> 03:06:48,388
What about the scene?
What had you had it with?

2605
03:06:48,491 --> 03:06:50,118
What about the scene were you sick of?

2606
03:06:50,226 --> 03:06:53,684
Well, you know, people like you.
People like, you know...

2607
03:06:53,797 --> 03:06:57,130
like, just, you know,
like just being pressed...

2608
03:06:57,233 --> 03:07:01,499
and hammered and, you know,
expected to answer questions. You know...

2609
03:07:01,605 --> 03:07:05,598
What can I... You know, like...
It was enough to make anybody sick, really.

2610
03:07:15,885 --> 03:07:19,343
<i>OI' black Bascom, don't break no mirrors</i>

2611
03:07:19,956 --> 03:07:23,858
<i>Cold black water dog, make no tears</i>

2612
03:07:24,861 --> 03:07:27,591
<i>You say you love me with what may be love</i>

2613
03:07:29,232 --> 03:07:32,292
<i>Don't you remember making baby love?</i>

2614
03:07:33,903 --> 03:07:36,030
<i>Got your steam drill now you're</i>

2615
03:07:36,139 --> 03:07:39,768
<i>lookin' for some kid to get it to work for you</i>

2616
03:07:39,876 --> 03:07:42,310
<i>like your nine-pound hammer did</i>

2617
03:07:42,679 --> 03:07:45,739
<i>But I know that you know that</i>

2618
03:07:46,049 --> 03:07:48,415
<i>I know that you show something is</i>

2619
03:07:49,753 --> 03:07:53,211
<i>tearing up your mind</i>

2620
03:07:57,227 --> 03:08:00,196
<i>Tell me, momma</i>

2621
03:08:01,564 --> 03:08:03,930
<i>Tell me, momma</i>

2622
03:08:06,202 --> 03:08:09,171
<i>Tell me, momma, what is it?</i>

2623
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:14,371
<i>What's wrong with you this time?</i>

2624
03:08:23,787 --> 03:08:24,754
He's cheap!

2625
03:08:26,156 --> 03:08:29,182
And having a half concert.
Half one and half the other.

2626
03:08:29,359 --> 03:08:32,089
Fake, hypocrite!

2627
03:08:32,629 --> 03:08:33,926
That's what he is.

2628
03:08:34,030 --> 03:08:36,430
<i>Everybody's wondering when your</i>

2629
03:08:36,533 --> 03:08:39,502
<i>friendship's gonna end but</i>

2630
03:08:39,602 --> 03:08:43,038
<i>Come on, baby, I'm your friend</i>

2631
03:08:43,139 --> 03:08:46,074
<i>And I know that you know that I know</i>

2632
03:08:46,976 --> 03:08:49,171
<i>that you show something</i>

2633
03:08:50,714 --> 03:08:54,946
<i>Is tearing up your mind</i>

2634
03:08:58,254 --> 03:09:00,347
- Crap.
- Crap. Rubbish.

2635
03:09:01,524 --> 03:09:03,082
- Complete rubbish.
- Pathetic.

2636
03:09:03,193 --> 03:09:04,626
Moronic.

2637
03:09:04,861 --> 03:09:08,319
We paid to see a flipping folk singer,
not a big group.

2638
03:09:16,106 --> 03:09:18,199
- Didn't you boo me last night?
- I didn't.

2639
03:09:18,308 --> 03:09:20,037
- Oh?
- We didn't boo you, Bob.

2640
03:09:20,176 --> 03:09:21,939
- Please, just a minute.
- Well.

2641
03:09:22,045 --> 03:09:24,639
I want the names
of all the people that booed me.

2642
03:09:24,748 --> 03:09:28,309
We didn't boo you! Come back soon.

2643
03:09:28,518 --> 03:09:31,385
Okay. I'll... I'll be back in a month or two.

2644
03:09:31,488 --> 03:09:34,548
- We'll wait ya!
- So long, cheerio!

2645
03:09:34,991 --> 03:09:36,925
All you sweet, lovely people.

2646
03:09:37,026 --> 03:09:38,789
- Hello, Bob!
- So long, sweet...

2647
03:09:38,895 --> 03:09:41,762
For the first half,
when they're all so quiet, I'll just...

2648
03:09:41,865 --> 03:09:45,665
I'll play four or five songs
and they just don't make a sound.

2649
03:09:46,102 --> 03:09:47,694
All of a sudden, "Boo."

2650
03:09:50,907 --> 03:09:53,398
And then Albert will come out
and they go, "Boo."

2651
03:09:53,510 --> 03:09:55,910
And I loved the description
in the paper last night.

2652
03:09:56,012 --> 03:09:57,274
What they said, that was classic.

2653
03:09:57,380 --> 03:09:59,280
There wasn't one truth in the entire article.

2654
03:09:59,382 --> 03:10:01,009
It was all the most fantastic lies...

2655
03:10:01,117 --> 03:10:03,585
- they could concoct.
- From what town, man?

2656
03:10:03,686 --> 03:10:07,144
From the last town, Edinburgh.
"Another night of catcalls for Dylan."

2657
03:10:07,290 --> 03:10:10,748
- Oh, I didn't see that.
- "Many of the audience walked out."

2658
03:10:11,361 --> 03:10:14,125
I saw one, man.
Did you see one paper that said...

2659
03:10:14,230 --> 03:10:17,688
- everybody walked out?
- I haven't seen that one.

2660
03:10:18,134 --> 03:10:21,968
Everybody walked out.
Saw a paper it said, "Everybody walked out."

2661
03:10:22,205 --> 03:10:25,436
- In Liverpool, I saw it.
- They're really losing their minds.

2662
03:10:29,012 --> 03:10:31,640
- Totally insane.
- I'm going to walk out.

2663
03:10:32,849 --> 03:10:34,441
"We want the real Dylan."

2664
03:10:34,717 --> 03:10:36,582
"Will the real Dylan stand up?"

2665
03:10:38,221 --> 03:10:41,213
I've decided just to tell them, man,
that Dylan got sick.

2666
03:10:46,296 --> 03:10:49,060
What do you think? Just...

2667
03:10:49,232 --> 03:10:51,166
I won't tell anybody what you say.
What do you think?

2668
03:10:51,267 --> 03:10:53,861
- Not your personal comment.
- Yeah. What do you think?

2669
03:10:55,071 --> 03:10:56,936
I have no opinion about that.

2670
03:10:57,440 --> 03:10:58,600
Well, why?

2671
03:10:59,209 --> 03:11:01,541
Because I haven't heard you sing, actually.

2672
03:11:01,644 --> 03:11:03,874
You've never heard me sing?

2673
03:11:03,980 --> 03:11:06,744
And here you are sitting here
and you're asking me all these questions.

2674
03:11:06,850 --> 03:11:09,182
- Well, this is my job.
- Yeah, well.

2675
03:11:18,127 --> 03:11:20,960
- Suck them?
- Put them in your mouth for one second.

2676
03:11:21,064 --> 03:11:24,090
Put the corner of your glasses
in your mouth. That's it.

2677
03:11:24,200 --> 03:11:25,792
Just suck your glasses.

2678
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:32,667
No, I don't want to suck them.

2679
03:11:32,775 --> 03:11:34,766
- Does anybody want to suck my glasses?
- Yeah.

2680
03:11:57,133 --> 03:11:58,122
Who said that?

2681
03:11:58,234 --> 03:12:02,762
- This one here. This fellow here.
- You? Ask him if he's American.

2682
03:12:03,840 --> 03:12:05,967
- Are you American?
- I'm French.

2683
03:12:08,011 --> 03:12:11,003
Well, that's why you probably think
the first records are better.

2684
03:12:26,863 --> 03:12:28,854
<i>This is called...</i>

2685
03:12:30,300 --> 03:12:35,260
<i>This is a folk song.
I want to sing a folk song now.</i>

2686
03:12:42,178 --> 03:12:44,806
<i>I knew that would make you happy.</i>

2687
03:12:45,715 --> 03:12:50,516
<i>This is called Yes, I See You've Got Your
Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat.</i>

2688
03:13:55,318 --> 03:13:57,582
- Sign it!
- You're so miserable.

2689
03:13:57,687 --> 03:14:00,485
- It won't take...
- It won't take half an hour just to sign it.

2690
03:14:00,590 --> 03:14:03,821
They don't ask me, those other two people
don't ask me. Why do you?

2691
03:14:03,926 --> 03:14:05,951
- Why shouldn't you give it?
- You're so miserable?

2692
03:14:06,062 --> 03:14:07,529
Why do we come out to see you for?

2693
03:14:07,630 --> 03:14:10,030
- Because they like me they said...
- We don't like you anymore.

2694
03:14:10,133 --> 03:14:11,122
She called me a bum.

2695
03:14:11,234 --> 03:14:13,566
- I'll tell you why!
- May I have your autograph, please?

2696
03:14:13,669 --> 03:14:15,694
He'll call you a bum
you don't sign the autograph.

2697
03:14:15,805 --> 03:14:16,464
- Come on, Bob.
- Oh, come on!

2698
03:14:17,206 --> 03:14:20,767
You don't need my autograph.
If you needed it, I'd give it to you.

2699
03:14:21,377 --> 03:14:25,108
- Just give up your autograph, will you?
- What's wrong with him today, eh?

2700
03:14:25,248 --> 03:14:27,739
<i>Ain't it just like the night</i>

2701
03:14:27,850 --> 03:14:31,650
<i>to play tricks
when you're trying to be so quiet?</i>

2702
03:14:35,658 --> 03:14:38,092
<i>We sit here stranded</i>

2703
03:14:38,561 --> 03:14:42,224
<i>though we all do our best to deny it</i>

2704
03:14:45,701 --> 03:14:49,865
<i>And Louise holds a handful of rain</i>

2705
03:14:50,106 --> 03:14:53,234
<i>tempting you to defy it</i>

2706
03:14:56,079 --> 03:15:00,743
<i>Lights flicker from the opposite loft</i>

2707
03:15:02,151 --> 03:15:05,643
<i>In this room the heat pipes just cough</i>

2708
03:15:07,557 --> 03:15:11,254
<i>The country music station plays soft</i>

2709
03:15:11,561 --> 03:15:15,497
<i>But there's nothing,
really nothing to turn off</i>

2710
03:15:21,404 --> 03:15:23,736
<i>Just Louise</i>

2711
03:15:24,373 --> 03:15:28,366
<i>and her lover so entwined</i>

2712
03:15:31,814 --> 03:15:35,978
<i>And these visions of Johanna</i>

2713
03:15:37,720 --> 03:15:41,121
<i>that conquer my mind</i>

2714
03:15:52,101 --> 03:15:54,069
<i>Hey, we've been on the road
a long time, right?</i>

2715
03:15:54,170 --> 03:15:56,536
<i>I don't know. I don't remember.</i>

2716
03:15:56,839 --> 03:15:59,569
<i>- I guess maybe we have.
- We've been on the road a very long time.</i>

2717
03:15:59,675 --> 03:16:03,236
Man, I can't make it tonight.
I don't know how to cover up for it.

2718
03:16:03,346 --> 03:16:05,576
It's something I never figured out.

2719
03:16:06,482 --> 03:16:09,918
There's nothing I can do about it.
I just shouldn't be singing.

2720
03:16:11,420 --> 03:16:13,752
I think I'm gonna get me a new Bob Dylan
next week.

2721
03:16:13,856 --> 03:16:16,017
Get me a new Bob Dylan and use him.

2722
03:16:17,560 --> 03:16:20,085
Use the new Bob Dylan,
see how long he lasts!

2723
03:16:20,530 --> 03:16:23,124
<i>He brags of his misery</i>

2724
03:16:23,566 --> 03:16:26,763
<i>he likes to live dangerously</i>

2725
03:16:30,473 --> 03:16:33,067
<i>And when bringing her name up</i>

2726
03:16:33,442 --> 03:16:36,605
<i>he speaks of her farewell kiss to me</i>

2727
03:16:40,349 --> 03:16:43,216
<i>He's sure got a lot of gall</i>

2728
03:16:45,521 --> 03:16:48,888
<i>to be so useless and all</i>

2729
03:16:50,726 --> 03:16:54,719
<i>Muttering small talk at the wall</i>

2730
03:16:55,064 --> 03:16:57,658
<i>while I'm in the hall</i>

2731
03:17:01,404 --> 03:17:04,532
<i>Oh, how can I explain?</i>

2732
03:17:04,640 --> 03:17:08,599
<i>It's so hard to get on</i>

2733
03:17:11,914 --> 03:17:16,044
<i>And these visions of Johanna</i>

2734
03:17:16,986 --> 03:17:21,616
<i>they kept me up past the dawn</i>

2735
03:17:45,181 --> 03:17:48,309
I want to go home.
You know what home is?

2736
03:17:48,818 --> 03:17:52,777
I don't want to go to Italy no more.
I don't want to go nowhere no more.

2737
03:17:53,155 --> 03:17:55,453
You end up crashing in a private airplane...

2738
03:17:55,558 --> 03:17:58,391
in the mountains of Tennessee.

2739
03:17:59,996 --> 03:18:01,054
Or Sicily.

2740
03:18:03,232 --> 03:18:07,328
When you stay in the States,
I mean, when you come back?

2741
03:18:07,670 --> 03:18:09,831
I don't know. I just want to go home.

2742
03:18:49,874 --> 03:18:52,138
<i>- Are you in the controls at all?
- Yeah.</i>

2743
03:18:52,276 --> 03:18:53,573
<i>What does it sound like?</i>

2744
03:18:53,811 --> 03:18:56,336
<i>Like you're in
a recording studio downstairs...</i>

2745
03:18:56,481 --> 03:18:58,449
<i>the son of a bitch picks up great here.</i>

2746
03:18:58,750 --> 03:19:01,583
<i>The acoustics are fantastic.
I don't know what they'll be like...</i>

2747
03:19:01,686 --> 03:19:04,849
<i>Fellas, can we have you, please?
In about two minutes.</i>

2748
03:19:05,790 --> 03:19:07,155
<i>Okay, two minutes.</i>

2749
03:19:07,258 --> 03:19:09,749
<i>No. I mean by the time you get down there
it'll be two minutes...</i>

2750
03:19:09,861 --> 03:19:11,522
<i>not, "In two minutes,
we start to go down there. "</i>

2751
03:19:13,998 --> 03:19:16,796
<i>- Yeah, two minutes.
- Hey, two minutes, man.</i>

2752
03:19:25,677 --> 03:19:28,703
Last on the bill.
Not least, ladies and gentlemen...

2753
03:19:31,315 --> 03:19:33,374
here he is, back from the grave.

2754
03:19:33,918 --> 03:19:36,386
Right, straight from the grave.

2755
03:19:46,064 --> 03:19:47,998
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

2756
03:19:57,408 --> 03:19:58,636
<i>You're a liar!</i>

2757
03:20:17,428 --> 03:20:20,295
<i>Once upon a time you dressed so fine</i>

2758
03:20:20,398 --> 03:20:22,958
<i>Threw the bums a dime in your prime</i>

2759
03:20:24,502 --> 03:20:26,197
<i>didn't you?</i>

2760
03:20:28,506 --> 03:20:32,465
<i>People'd call, say, "Beware, doll
You're bound to fall"</i>

2761
03:20:32,577 --> 03:20:35,239
<i>You thought that they were all</i>

2762
03:20:35,580 --> 03:20:37,377
<i>Kidding you</i>

2763
03:20:40,251 --> 03:20:43,049
<i>You used to</i>

2764
03:20:43,154 --> 03:20:44,917
<i>laugh about</i>

2765
03:20:46,891 --> 03:20:50,383
<i>Everybody that was hangin' out</i>

2766
03:20:51,462 --> 03:20:55,865
<i>Now you don't talk so loud</i>

2767
03:20:56,901 --> 03:21:01,167
<i>Now you don't seem so proud</i>

2768
03:21:01,973 --> 03:21:05,272
<i>About having to be scrounging around</i>

2769
03:21:06,077 --> 03:21:10,537
<i>for your next meal</i>

2770
03:21:11,449 --> 03:21:14,111
<i>How does it feel</i>

2771
03:21:17,088 --> 03:21:18,350
<i>How does it feel</i>

2772
03:21:21,759 --> 03:21:24,956
<i>To be on your own</i>

2773
03:21:27,131 --> 03:21:30,532
<i>No direction home</i>

2774
03:21:32,503 --> 03:21:35,995
<i>Like a complete unknown</i>

2775
03:21:38,142 --> 03:21:41,634
<i>Like a rolling stone?</i>

2776
03:21:53,457 --> 03:21:55,948
<i>You've gone to the finest school</i>

2777
03:21:56,060 --> 03:21:59,791
<i>All right, Miss Lonely
But you only used to get</i>

2778
03:22:01,132 --> 03:22:03,623
<i>juiced in it</i>

2779
03:22:04,402 --> 03:22:08,930
<i>Nobody's ever taught you how
to live out on the street</i>

2780
03:22:09,073 --> 03:22:10,904
<i>But now</i>

2781
03:22:11,642 --> 03:22:15,271
<i>you're gonna have to get used to it</i>

2782
03:22:16,881 --> 03:22:21,341
<i>You said you'd never compromise</i>

2783
03:22:22,053 --> 03:22:26,717
<i>With the mystery tramp,
but now you realize</i>

2784
03:22:27,525 --> 03:22:31,791
<i>He's not selling any alibis</i>

2785
03:22:32,997 --> 03:22:37,127
<i>As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes</i>

2786
03:22:37,468 --> 03:22:39,129
<i>And say</i>

2787
03:22:39,770 --> 03:22:44,571
<i>do you want to make a deal?</i>

2788
03:22:47,245 --> 03:22:50,476
<i>How does it feel</i>

2789
03:22:52,583 --> 03:22:55,347
<i>How does it feel</i>

2790
03:22:57,188 --> 03:23:00,817
<i>To be on your own</i>

2791
03:23:02,927 --> 03:23:06,454
<i>With no direction home</i>

2792
03:23:08,399 --> 03:23:12,028
<i>Like a complete unknown</i>

2793
03:23:13,771 --> 03:23:17,571
<i>Like a rolling stone?</i>

2794
03:23:49,473 --> 03:23:51,065
<i>Thank you.</i>

2795
03:23:58,683 --> 03:24:03,552
<i>Lay down your weary tune</i>

2796
03:24:03,854 --> 03:24:05,219
<i>Lay down</i>

2797
03:24:07,458 --> 03:24:10,723
<i>Lay down the song you strum</i>

2798
03:24:13,097 --> 03:24:15,622
<i>And rest yourself</i>

2799
03:24:15,733 --> 03:24:18,793
<i>'neath the strength of strings</i>

2800
03:24:20,538 --> 03:24:24,167
<i>No voice can hope</i>

2801
03:24:24,275 --> 03:24:25,902
<i>to hum</i>

2802
03:24:28,746 --> 03:24:33,183
<i>Struck by the sounds before the sun</i>

2803
03:24:36,087 --> 03:24:39,887
<i>I knew the night had gone</i>

2804
03:24:41,859 --> 03:24:44,487
<i>The morning breeze</i>

2805
03:24:44,595 --> 03:24:47,063
<i>like a bugle blew</i>

2806
03:24:49,400 --> 03:24:54,303
<i>Against the drums of dawn</i>

2807
03:24:56,107 --> 03:25:00,840
<i>Lay down your weary tune</i>

2808
03:25:00,945 --> 03:25:02,344
<i>Lay down</i>

2809
03:25:04,415 --> 03:25:08,351
<i>Lay down the song you strum</i>

2810
03:25:08,919 --> 03:25:11,444
<i>And rest yourself</i>

2811
03:25:11,555 --> 03:25:14,353
<i>'neath the strength of strings</i>

2812
03:25:16,360 --> 03:25:20,057
<i>No voice can hope</i>

2813
03:25:20,164 --> 03:25:21,461
<i>to hum</i>

2814
03:25:23,567 --> 03:25:26,695
<i>The ocean wild</i>

2815
03:25:26,804 --> 03:25:29,739
<i>like an organ played</i>

2816
03:25:31,709 --> 03:25:35,736
<i>The seaweed's wove its strands</i>

2817
03:25:37,148 --> 03:25:39,742
<i>The crashin' waves</i>

2818
03:25:39,850 --> 03:25:42,717
<i>like cymbals clashed</i>

2819
03:25:44,255 --> 03:25:47,850
<i>Against the rocks</i>

2820
03:25:47,958 --> 03:25:49,983
<i>and sands</i>

2821
03:25:50,928 --> 03:25:55,888
<i>Lay down your weary tune</i>

2822
03:25:56,100 --> 03:25:57,499
<i>Lay down</i>

2823
03:25:59,703 --> 03:26:03,605
<i>Lay down the song you strum</i>

2824
03:26:05,309 --> 03:26:07,800
<i>And rest yourself</i>

2825
03:26:07,912 --> 03:26:10,904

<i>No voice can hope</i>

2827
03:26:16,287 --> 03:26:17,811
<i>to hum</i>

2828
03:26:19,457 --> 03:26:24,292
<i>I stood unwound beneath the skies</i>

2829
03:26:26,363 --> 03:26:30,766
<i>And clouds unbound by laws</i>

2830
03:26:32,002 --> 03:26:34,562
<i>The cryin' rain</i>

2831
03:26:34,672 --> 03:26:37,334
<i>like a trumpet sang</i>

2832
03:26:39,443 --> 03:26:44,346
<i>And asked for no applause</i>

2833
03:26:45,116 --> 03:26:49,815
<i>Lay down your weary tune</i>

2834
03:26:49,920 --> 03:26:51,285
<i>Lay down</i>

2835
03:26:53,357 --> 03:26:56,815
<i>Lay down the song you strum</i>

2836
03:26:56,927 --> 03:26:59,259
<i>And rest yourself</i>

2837
03:26:59,363 --> 03:27:02,161

<i>to hum</i>

2840
03:27:11,041 --> 03:27:15,740
<i>The last of leave fell from the trees</i>

2841
03:27:18,015 --> 03:27:22,247
<i>And clung to a new love's breast</i>

2842
03:27:23,587 --> 03:27:28,524
<i>The branches bare like a banjo moaned</i>

2843
03:27:30,861 --> 03:27:35,798
<i>To the winds that listened best</i>

2844
03:27:37,835 --> 03:27:42,738
<i>Lay down your weary tune
Lay down</i>

2845
03:27:45,176 --> 03:27:48,737
<i>Lay down the song you strum</i>

2846
03:27:48,846 --> 03:27:51,212

2847
03:27:51,315 --> 03:27:54,113
<i>'neath the strength of strings</i>

2848
03:27:56,120 --> 03:28:01,057
<i>No voice can hope to hum</i>
