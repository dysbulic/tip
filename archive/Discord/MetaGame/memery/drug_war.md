U.S. Could Give $1,875 Stimulus Checks For 8 Months For Same Cost A...
The U.S. could afford to give every American $1,875 stimulus checks for eight months for the same cost as the tax cuts that Trump passed in 2017, Robert Reich argued last week.

Going to have to switch those to $2500 stimulus checks when the dollar dips below .80....

20% of dollars came into existence this year.

The thing is productivity is up so much that I don't think the system would collapse without the threat of hunger or homelessness.

Even if 60% of people just sit around and get high, with robots and aquaculture and whatnot, we'll coast to the robots and AIs doing everything.

Before 1968 there were insufficient calories of food produced that someone somewhere wasn't going to bed hungry.

Your ideal systems for that world are more adversarial than those that can exist post-scarcity.

Yeh, but Game-A still thinks scarcity is real... and a ton of folks just actually died because of it... I can't imagine that sh*t wasn't intentional.
If Games are an art, what are they the art of?  Games are the art of War.  What is the art of War if not the tao of Peace?
tbf, 'Game-B' is just as much a part of 'Game-A' as it ever was, because Game-A has always been dependent on a metagame... what we need folx to learn is that play is real :heart: and that reality is not a game :heart: but that sort of koan seems contradictory to most folx still...
That and I don't think the world has ever seen an actual "holographic consensus reality engine", and maybe we have a chance to change the way play works this time around :heart:

There was an experiment where a researcher built a park for rats with lots of amenities and entertainments.

When compared to rats kept in cages, the addiction rate to readily available heroin water was 3% as opposed the 96% of caged rats that became junkies.

I want to be part of building that park for us.

I sure hope so!

And even the rats who had been previously addicted, weaned themselves off of their addiction.

The environment we are in influences everything. 

Corollary: to change the outcome, change the environment (system).

I think the war on drugs will be remembered as a social ill on par with slavery and the Holocaust.

I know it sounds dramatic, but before 1968 there wasn't enough food for everyone, so the world had to be a more brutal place.

Millions in jail, violence in the streets, and dangerously adulterated substances all because the laws dictated it.

It is a constant drain on our system in so many ways that won't be recognized until after it passes. Thinking drug dealers should be in jail is the same as being ok with racially segregated facilities 50 years ago.

Amazing experiment and I agree on most implications that were derived from it but it's important to note:
-The sample was really small
-It proved hard to replicate as subsequent follow-ups produced different results than the original prompting genetic factors may have a certain degree of influence
-Apparently, the gender of mice included also affected the results (females tried the spiked water more often than males but overall preference was lower than in males)
-So, being isolated and lacking sex were kind of the main factors implied for the results that the experiment recieved
My thoughts are that the environment is definitively a modeler of behavior but would go deeper and say the social interconnections within the environment play a huge role including availability and constructed norms. 
It kind of correlates with the fact that prohibitions of drugs (alcohol, heroin, mj and others) produced more addictions, exclusions (hard to find a job, societal excommunication, aversion ...) and deaths (both from ODs and from the "War on Drugs")
Portugal produced some great results when they decriminalized drugs
