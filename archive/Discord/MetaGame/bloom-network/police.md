I've been contemplating an alternative to the police. Thinking about it has really highlighted for me the variety of functions officers play in society.

I wanted to tackle most problems through the use of privately shared livestreams. I call the cops and I get a pair of people one of whose job is to make sure the event makes it into the cloud.

I get to watch the view from their phone and there is an operator monitoring the stream and providing support.

For situations where physical force is required I've been contemplating how to distribute a token so it correlates to physical dangerousness.

I was thinking of recording fights which are then scored by other fighters and DNGR tokens minted according to some sort of consensus.

I want to pay these people 15xDAI/hr for all sorts of activities. Working out, fighting, target practice, patrolling, …

I also though want for these cars to be functioning as rideshares and couriers when not engaged in policing. That would allow lots of potential respondents on the road, but they won't just be idle.

The part that still has me stymied is the dispatch. Calls coming in will contain potentially sensitive information, so they can't simply be public on the internet.

Someone has to know where all the cars are though to properly orchestrate calls. Parts can be automated, but I want a caller to be able to speak to a live person.

Maybe a token intermediated database where a DAO manages reputability. All these streams would be saved so investigations of complaints could be fairly objective.

It sounds like they're struggling with one of the questions I've had: the existing police response is to arrest someone and put them in a cell.

What do you do to someone who is an ongoing threat if you don't have the infrastructure to imprison them?

You can remove individuals from a situation and prevent them from returning, but someone might become violent and refuse to leave.

I suppose that extent of antisociability would have to be argued mental illness and the person given over to rehabilitation.

...but what does 'rehabilitation' really mean?  I think there are at least two necessary core mechanics. 1) harm reduction 2) identify and meet needs :heart: 99.9999999999% of cases are failures of the granularity of the network that mediates those factors... and the carceral state is madness, but that is another story :heart: SLEEP :heart: it's what the doctor has ordered, and she won't let me say no :heart:

Mostly in this situation rehabilitation means the person is restrained from going back to where they were unwelcome and hopefully made to understand why they were ejected.

As with the rat park experiment I think much of violence is a learned response fueled by frustration and impotence. In a richer environment perhaps we could see it fade away.

Re: energy independence and the response of... interdependence, I just joined the board of this decentralized solar power cooperative that serves "frontline" communities (mostly BIPOC communities in the U.S.). They also have a national-scale spinoff whose name I can't find right now.

https://www.cooppower.coop/about-us


There is a guy in Bloom, Lorenzo Kristov, who works on transitioning town/city-scale energy from corporate owned to cooperatively owned by residents so they can re-invest the profits into their neighborhoods. He works with corporate, state, city, and civilian actors to help this transition happen. He says that within the large power companies there are plenty of people who see the problems and what can be different, but they need help organizing to make it happen. It's on our list of things to make happen in Bloom when we have financial capacity to.


This is a private security company in Detroit that people can call instead of the police: http://www.threatmanagementcenter.com/


Restorative justice is another practice Bloom promotes. It has better outcomes (everyone gets what they actually need to restore a sense of safety and autonomy), and is way cheaper. https://transformharm.org/transformative-justice-a-brief-description/


And yeah the other dimension of violence is wiser childcare and education in real communities not industrial systems, and getting families trauma healing since many of us have our lifetime and intergenerational trauma we don't have the resources (knowledge, access to effective methods to heal), etc.


Check out the link Uranus posted in Bloom's Kids & Families channel about how Inuit parents teach their kids to deal with anger.


We're just now starting to work on Bloom's tokenomics setup to incentivize this stuff, this thread has been great food for thought on that! We are here mostly to help mainstream all these better practices, and see cryptocurrency as <clipped message>

Here's a community call we did last August where Lorenzo Kristov talks about energy and revenue  - I think you guys would like this one, it's with Kevin Carson too, and Josie Watson who does local food system research/policy/convening. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yvCopndG-urvJDhknsTBkNWEM9F-QUH6/view?usp=sharing . (Lorenzo talks around 28:00 in, at 54:00, and 1:16:00). He also sent us this awesome article he wrote on the energy future: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/search?q=lorenzo%20kristov and this one laying out a practical vision for resilient community more broadly. He does electricity market design and distribution planning.

One last thought then I'll shut up - specifically in relation to DAO's, if you linked energy profits or providing energy to neighbors with other services people were offering regionally, such as locally produced food, healing offerings, building services and materials, etc etc etc, you can either have a circulating local economy and/or pool the electricity profits into a DAO where the community members have voting power and can choose together where to wisely distribute it. We're actively working toward making this happen through Bloom Network and have done a lot of legwork on the governance processes for it, so let's keep the conversation going together!

@magenta I just sent you an invite to LexDao which is a legal framework Community that might be able to help you construct those legal wrappers inside the structuring. 

Just more resources and bridge building!!!
Its got all the best pieces of Regenerative, Circular, or Doughnut economics. Funny how it all tries to describe that toroflux shaped spinup of energy and abundance!!! 

I listened through those Google drive talks and I'm definitely excited to be soooo close to connecting all these pieces and also finding relevant Local Anexes to actually participate
