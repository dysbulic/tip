<p>Hang on for some metaphysics. The Aneristic Principle is that of ORDER, the
Eristic Principle is that of DISORDER. On the surface, the Universe seems (to
the ignorant) to be ordered; this is the ANERISTIC ILLUSION. Actually, what
order is &quot;there&quot; is imposed on primal chaos in the same sense that a
person's name is draped over his actual self. It is the job of the scientist,
for example, to implement this principle in a practical manner and some are
quite brilliant at it. But on closer examination, order dissolves into disorder,
which is the <b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">ERISTIC ILLUSION.</span></b></p>
<p>-Malaclypse the Younger, K.S.C., <i>Principia Discordia</i></p>
<p>And Spaceship Earth, that glorious and bloody circus, continued its
four-billion-year-long spiral orbit about the Sun; the engineering, I must
admit, was so exquisite that none of the passengers felt any motion at all.
Those on the dark side of the ship mostly slept and voyaged into worlds of
freedom and fantasy; those on the light side moved about the tasks appointed for
them by their rulers, or idled waiting for the next order from above. In Las
Vegas, Dr. Charles Mocenigo woke from another nightmare and went to the toilet
to wash his hands. He thought of his date the next night with Sherri Brandi and,
quite mercifully, had no inkling that it would be his last contact with a woman.
Still seeking calm, he went to the window and looked at the stars-being a
specialist, with no interest beyond his own field, he imagined he was looking up
rather than out at them. In New Delhi aboard the afternoon TWA flight for Hong
Kong, Honolulu, and Los Angeles, R. Buckminster Fuller, one of the few people to
be aware that he lived on a spaceship, glanced at his three watches, showing
local time (5:30 P.M.), time at Honolulu, his point of destination (2:30 A.M.
the next morning) and present time in his home at Carbondale, Illinois (3:30
A.M. the previous morning.) In Paris, the noon crowds were jostled by hordes of
young people distributing leaflets glowingly describing the world's greatest
Rock Festival and Cosmic Love Feast to be celebrated on the shores of Lake
Totenkopf near Ingolstadt at the end of the month. At Sunderland, England, a
young psychiatrist left his lunch to rush to the chronic ward and listen to
weird babble proceeding from a patient who had been decade-silent: &quot;On <i>Walpurgasnacht
</i>it's coming. That's when His power is strongest. That's when you'll see Him.
Right at the very stroke of midnight.&quot; In the middle of the Atlantic,
Howard the porpoise, swimming with friends in the mid-morning sun, encountered
some sharks and had a nasty fight. Saul Goodman rubbed tired eyes in New York
City as dawn crept over the windowsill, and read a memo about Charlemagne and
the Courts of the Illuminated; Rebecca Goodman, meanwhile, read how the jealous
priests of Bel-Marduk betrayed Babylon to the invading army of Cyrus because
their young king, Belshazzar, had embraced the love-cult of the goddess Ishtar.
In Chicago, Simon Moon was listening to the birds begin to sing and waiting for
the first cinnamon rays of dawn, as Mary Lou Servix slept beside him; his mind
was active, thinking about pyramids and rain-gods and sexual yoga and
fifth-dimensional geometries, but thinking mostly about the Ingolstadt Rock
Festival and wondering if it would all happen as Hagbard Celine had predicted.</p>
<p><i>(Two blocks north in space and over forty years back in time, Simon's
mother heard pistol shots as she left Wobbly Hall-Simon was a second-generation
anarchist-and followed the crowd to gather in front of the Biograph Theatre
where a man lay bleeding to death in the alley. And the next morning-July 23,
1934-Billie Freschette, in her cell at Cook County Jail, got the news from a
matron. </i>In this White Man's Country, I am the lowliest of the lowly,
subjugated because I am not white, and subjugated again because I am not male. I
am the embodiment of all that is rejected and scorned-the female, the colored,
the tribe, the earth-all that has no place in this world of white male
technology. I am the tree that is cut down to make room for the factory that
poisons the air. I am the river filled with sewage. I am the Body that the Mind
despises. I am the lowliest of the lowly, the mud beneath your feet. And yet of
all the world John Dillinger picked me to be his bride. He plunged within me,
into the very depths of me. I was his bride, not as your Wise Men and Churches
and Governments know marriage, but we were truly wed. As the tree is wed to the
earth, the mountain to the sky, the sun to the moon. I held his head to my
breast, and tousled his hair as if it were sweet as fresh grass, and I called
him &quot;Johnnie.&quot; He was more than a man. He was mad but not mad, not as
a man may go mad when he leaves his tribe and lives among hostile strangers and
is mistreated and scorned. He was not mad as all other white men are mad because
they have never known a tribe. He was mad as a god might be mad. And now they
tell me he is dead. <i>'Well,&quot; the matron asked finally, &quot;aren't you
going to say anything? Aren't you Indians human?&quot; She had a real evil shine
in her eye, like the eye of the rattlesnake. </i>She wants to see me cry. She
stands there and waits, watching me through the bars. <i>&quot;Don't you have
any feelings at all? Are you some kind of animal?&quot; </i>I say nothing. I
keep my face immobile. No white shall ever see the tears of a Menomi-nee. <i>At
the Biograph Theatre, Molly Moon turns away in disgust as souvenir hunters dip
their handkerchiefs in the blood. </i>I turn away from the matron and look up,
out the barred window, to the stars, and the spaces between them seem bigger
than ever. Bigger and emptier. Inside me there is a space like that now, big and
empty, and it will never be filled again. When the tree is torn out by its
roots, the earth must feel that way. The earth must scream silently, as I
screamed silently.) <i>But she understood the sacramental meaning of the
handkerchiefs dipped in blood; as Simon understands it.</i></p>
<p>Simon, in fact, had what can only be called a funky education. I mean, man,
when your parents are both anarchists the Chicago public school system is going
to do your head absolutely no good at all. Feature me in a 1956 classroom with
Eisenhower's Moby Dick face on one wall and Nixon's Captain Ahab glare on the
other, and in between, standing in front of the inevitable American rag, Miss
Doris Day or her older sister telling the class to take home a leaflet
explaining to their parents why it's important for them to vote.</p>
<p>&quot;My parents don't vote,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this leaflet will explain to them why they should,&quot; she
tells me with the real authentic Doris Day sunshine and Kansas cornball smile.
It's early in the term and she hasn't heard about me from the last-semester
teacher.</p>
<p>&quot;I really don't think so,&quot; I say politely. &quot;They don't think
it makes any difference whether Eisenhower or Stevenson is in the White House.
They say the orders will still come from Wall Street.&quot;</p>
<p>It's like a thundercloud. All the sunshine goes away. They never prepared her
for this in the school where they turn out all these Doris Day replicas. The
wisdom of the Fathers is being questioned. She opens her mouth and closes it and
opens and closes it and finally takes such a deep breath that every boy in the
room (we're all on the cusp of puberty) gets a hard-on from watching her breasts
heave up and slide down again. I mean, they're all praying (except me, I'm an
atheist, of course) that they won't get called on to stand up; if it wouldn't
attract attention, they'd be clubbing their dicks down with their geography
books. &quot;That's the wonderful thing about this country,&quot; she finally
gets out, &quot;even people with opinions like that can say what they want
without going to jail.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must be nuts,&quot; I say. &quot;My dad's been in and out of jail
so many times they should put in a special revolving door just for him: My mom,
too. <i>You </i>oughta go out with subversive leaflets in this town and see what
happens.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, of course, after school, a gang of patriots, with the odds around
seven-to-one, beat the shit out of me and make me kiss their red-white-and-blue
totem. It's no better at home. Mom's an anarcho-pacifist, Tolstoy and all that,
and she wants me to say I didn't fight back. Dad's a Wobbly and wants to be sure
that I hurt some of them at least as bad as they hurt me. After they yell at me
for a half hour, they yell at each other for two. Bakunin said this and
Kropotkin said that and Gandhi said the other and Martin Luther King is the
savior of America and Martin Luther King is a bloody fool who's selling his
people an opium Utopia and all that jive. Go down to Wobbly Hall or Solidarity
Bookstore and you'll still hear the same debate, doubled, redoubled, in spades,
and vulnerable.</p>
<p>So naturally I start hanging out on Wall Street and smoking dope and pretty
soon I'm the youngest living member of what they called the Beat Generation.
Which does not improve my relations with school authorities, but at least it's a
relief from all that patriotism and anarchism. By the time I'm seventeen and
they shot Kennedy and the country starts coming apart at the seams, we're not
beatniks anymore, we're hippies, and the thing to do is go to Mississippi. Did
you ever go to Mississippi? You know what Dr. Johnson said about
Scotland-&quot;The best thing you can say for it is that God created it for some
purpose, but the same is true of Hell.&quot; Blot Mississippi; it's not part of
this story anyway. The next stop was Antioch in dear old Yellow Springs where I
majored in mathematics for reasons you will soon guess. The pot there grows wild
in acres and acres of beautiful nature preserve kept up by the college. You can
go out there at night, pick your own grass for the week from the female of the
hemp species and sleep under the stars with a female of your own species, then
wake up in the morning with birds and rabbits and the whole lost Thomas Wolfe
America scene, a stone, a leaf, and unfound door and all of it, then make it to
class really feeling good and ready for an education. Once I woke up with a
spider running across my face, and I thought, &quot;So a spider is running
across my face,&quot; and brushed him off gently, &quot;it's his world,
too.&quot; In the city, I would have killed him. What I mean is Antioch is a
stone groove but that life is no preparation for coming back to Chicago and
Chemical Warfare. Not that I ever got maced before '68, but I could read the
signs; don't let anybody tell you it's pollution, brothers and sisters. It's
Chemical Warfare. They'll kill us all to make a buck.</p>
<p>I got stoned one night and went home to see what it would be like relating to
Mom and Dad in that condition. It was the same but different. Tolstoy coming out
of her mouth, Bakunin out of his. And it was suddenly all weird and
super-freaky, like Goddard shooting a Kafka scene: two dead Russians debating
with each other, long after they were dead and buried, out of the mouths of a
pair of Chicago Irish radicals. The young frontal-lobe-type anarchists in the
city were in their first surrealist revival just then and I had been reading
some of their stuff and it clicked.</p>
<p>&quot;You're both wrong,&quot; I said. &quot;Freedom won't come through Love,
and it won't come through Force. It will come through the Imagination.&quot; I
put in all the capital let-</p>
<p>ters and I was so stoned that they got contact-high and heard them, too.
Their mouths dropped open and I felt like William Blake telling Tom Paine where
it was really at. A Knight of Magic waving my wand and dispersing the shadows of
Maya.</p>
<p>Dad was the first to recover. &quot;Imagination,&quot; he said, his big red
face crinkling in that grin that always drove the cops crazy when they were
arresting him. &quot;That's what comes of sending good working-class boys to
rich people's colleges. Words and books get all mixed up with reality in their
heads. When you were in that jail in Mississippi you imagined yourself through
the walls, didn't you? How many times an hour did you imagine yourself through
the walls? I can guess. The first time I was arrested, during the GE strike of
thirty-three, I walked through those walls a million times. But every time I
opened my eyes, the walls and the bars were still there. What got me out
finally? What got you out of Biloxi finally? <i>Organization. </i>If you want
big words to talk to intellectuals with, that's a fine big word, son, just as
many syllables as <i>imagination, </i>and it has a lot more realism in it.&quot;</p>
<p>That's what I remember best about him, that one speech, and the strange clear
blue of his eyes. He died that year, and I found out that there was more to the
Imagination than I had known, for he didn't die at all. He's still around, in
the back of my skull somewhere, arguing with me, and that's the truth. It's also
the truth that he's dead, really dead, and part of me was buried with him. It's
uncool to love your father these days, so I didn't even know that I loved him
until they closed the coffin and I heard myself sobbing, and it comes back
again, that same emptiness, whenever I hear &quot;Joe Hill&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;The copper bosses lulled you, Joe.&quot; &quot;I never died,&quot; said
he.</p>
<p>Both lines are true, and mourning never ends. They didn't shoot Dad the clean
way, like Joe Hill, but they ground him down, year after year, burning out his
Wob fires (and he was Aries, a real fire sign) with their cops, their courts,
their jails, and their taxes, their corporations, their cages for the spirit and
cemeteries for the soul, their plastic liberalism and murderous Marxism, and
even as I say that I have to pay a debt to Lenin for he gave me the words to
express how I felt when Dad was gone. &quot;Revolutionaries,&quot; he said,
&quot;are dead men on furlough.&quot; The Democratic Convention of '68 was
coming and I knew that my own furlough might be much shorter than Dad's because
I was ready to fight them in the streets. All spring Mom was busy at the Women
for Peace center and I was busy conspiring with surrealists and Yippies. Then I
met Mao Tsu-hsi.</p>
<p>It was April 30, <i>Walpurgasnacht </i>(pause for thunder on the soundtrack),
and I was rapping with some of the crowd at the Friendly Stranger. H.P.
Lovecraft (the rock group, not the writer) was conducting services in the back
room, pounding away at the door to Acid Land in the gallant effort, new and
striking that year, to break in on waves of sound without any chemical skeleton
key at all and I am in no position to evaluate their success objectively since I
was, as is often the case with me, 99 and 44/100ths percent stoned out of my
gourd before they began operations. I kept catching this uniquely pensive
Oriental face at the next table, but my own gang, including the weird
faggot-priest we nicknamed Padre Pederastia, had most of my attention. I was
laying it on them heavy. It was my Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade period.</p>
<p>&quot;The head-trip anarchists are as constipated as the Marxists,&quot; I
was giving forth; you recognize the style by now. &quot;Who speaks for the
thalamus, the glands, the cells of the organism? Who <i>sees </i>the organism?
We cover it with clothes to hide its apehood. We won't have liberated ourselves
from servitude until people throw all their clothes in the closet in spring and
don't take them out again until winter. We won't be human beings, the way apes <i>are
</i>apes and dogs <i>are </i>dogs, until we fuck where and when we want to, like
any other mammal. Fucking in the streets isn't just a tactic to blow minds; it's
recapturing our own bodies. Anything less and we're still robots possessing the
wisdom of the straight line but not the understanding of the organic
curve.&quot; And so on. And so forth. I think I found a few good arguments for
rape and murder while I was at it.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step beyond anarchy,&quot; somebody said cynically. <i>&quot;Real
</i>chaos.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; I demanded. &quot;Who works at a straight job
here?&quot; None of them did, of course; I deal dope myself. &quot;Will you work
at a straight job for something that calls itself an anarchist syndicate? Will
you run an engine lathe eight unfucking hours a day because the syndicate tells
you the people need what the lathe produces? If you will, <i>the people </i>just
becomes a new tyrant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To hell with machines,&quot; Kevin McCool, the poet, said
enthusiastically. &quot;Back to the caves!&quot; He was as stoned as me.</p>
<p>The Oriental face leaned over: she was wearing a strange headband with a
golden apple inside a pentagon. Her black eyes somehow reminded me of my
father's blue eyes. &quot;What you want is an organization of the
imagination?&quot; she asked politely.</p>
<p>I flipped. It was too much, hearing those words just then.</p>
<p>&quot;A man at the Vedanta Society told me that John Dillinger walked through
the walls when he made his escape from Crown Point Jail,&quot; Miss Mao went on
in a level tone. &quot;Do you think that is possible?&quot;</p>
<p>You know how dark coffee houses are. The Friendly Stranger was murkier than
most. I had to get out. Blake talked to the Archangel Gabriel every morning at
breakfast, but I wasn't that heavy yet.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, where you going, Simon?&quot; somebody called. Miss Mao didn't say
anything, and I didn't look back at that polite and pensive face-it would have
been much easier if she looked sinister and inscrutable. But when I hit Lincoln
and started toward Fullerton, I heard steps behind me. I turned and Padre
Pederastia touched my arm gently.</p>
<p>&quot;I asked her to come and listen to you,&quot; he said. &quot;She was to
give a signal if she thought you were ready. The signal was more dramatic than I
expected, it seems. A conversation out of your past that had some heavy
emotional meaning to you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's a medium?&quot; I asked numbly.</p>
<p>&quot;You can name it that.&quot; I looked at him in the light from the
Biograph marquee and I remembered Mom's story about the people dipping their
handkerchiefs in Dillinger's blood and I heard the old hymn start in my head ARE
YOU WASHED are you washed ARE you WASHED in the BLOOD of the Lamb and I
remembered how we all thought he hung out with us freaks in the hope of leading
us back to the church holy Roman Catholic and apostolic as Dad called it when he
was drunk and bitter. It was obvious that whatever the Padre was recruiting for
had little to do with that particular theological trade union.</p>
<p>&quot;What is this?&quot; I asked. &quot;And who is that woman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's the daughter of Fu Manchu,&quot; he said. Suddenly, he threw his
head back and laughed like a rooster crowing. Just as suddenly, he stopped and
looked at me. Just looked at me.</p>
<p>&quot;Somehow,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;I've qualified for a small
demonstration of whatever you and she are selling. But I don't qualify for any
more until I make the right move?&quot; He gave the faintest hint of a nod and
went on watching me.</p>
<p>Well, I was young and ignorant of everything outside ten million books I'd
gobbled and guilty-unsure about my imaginative flights away from my father's
realism and of course stoned of course but I finally understood why he was
watching me that way, it was (this part of it) pure Zen, there was nothing I
could do consciously or by volition that would satisfy him and I had to do
exactly that which I could not <i>not </i>do, namely be Simon Moon. Which led to
deciding then and there without any time to mull it over and rationalize it just
what the hell being Simon Moon or, more precisely SimonMooning, consisted of,
and it seemed to be a matter of wandering through room after room of my brain
looking for the owner and not finding him anywhere, sweat broke out on my
forehead, it was becoming desperate because I was running out of rooms and the
Padre was still watching me.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody home,&quot; I said finally, sure that the answer wasn't good
enough.</p>
<p>&quot;That's odd,&quot; he said. &quot;Who's conducting the search?&quot;</p>
<p>And I walked through the walls and into the Fire.</p>
<p>Which was the beginning of the larger and funkier part of my (Simon's)
education, and where we cannot, as yet, follow him. He sleeps now, a teacher
rather than a learner, while Mary Lou Servix awakes beside him and tries to
decide whether it was just the pot or if something really spooky happened last
night. Howard sports in the Atlantic; Buckminster Fuller, flying above the
Pacific, crosses the international date line and slips back into April 23 again;
it is dawn in Las Vegas and Mocenigo, the nightmares and anxieties of night
forgotten, looks forward cheerfully to the production of the first live cultures
of Anthrax-Leprosy-Pi, which will make this a memorable day in more ways than he
expects; and George Dorn, somewhere outside this time system, is writing in his
journal. Each word, however, seems magically to appear by itself as if no
volition on his part were necessary to its production. He read the words his
pencil scrawled, but they appeared the communications of another intelligence.
Yet they picked up where he had left off in his hotel room and they spoke with
his private idiom:</p>
<p>. . . the universe is the inside without any outside, the sound made by one
eye opening. In fact, I don't even know that there is a universe. More likely,
there are many <i>multi</i>verses, each with its own dimensions, times, spaces,
laws and eccentricities. We wander between and among these multiverses, trying
to convince others and ourselves that we all walk together in a single public
universe that we can share. For to deny that axiom leads to what is called
schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's it: every man's skin is his own private multiverse, just like
every man's home is supposed to be his castle. But all the multiverses are
trying to merge, to create a true universe such as we have only imagined
previously. Maybe it will be spiritual, like Zen or telepathy, or maybe it will
be physical, one great big gang-fuck, but it has to happen: the creation of a
universe and the one great eye opening to see itself at last. Aum Shiva!</p>
<p>-Oh, man, you're stoned out of your gourd. You're writing gibberish.</p>
<p>No, I'm writing with absolute clarity, for the first time in my life.</p>
<p>-Yeah? Well what was that business about the universe being the sound of one
eye opening?</p>
<p>Never mind that. Who the hell are you and how did you get into my head?</p>
<p>&quot;Your turn now, George.&quot;</p>
<p>Sheriff Cartwright stood in the door, a monk in a strange red and white robe
beside him, holding some kind of wand the deep color of a fire engine.</p>
<p>&quot;No-no-&quot; George started to stammer. But he knew.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you know,&quot; the Sheriff said kindly-as if he were
suddenly sorry about it all. &quot;You knew before you left New York and came
down here.&quot;</p>
<p>They were at the foot of the gallows. &quot;. . . each with its own times,
spaces, laws and eccentricities,&quot; George was thinking wildly. Yes: if the
universe is one big eye looking at itself, then telepathy is no miracle, for
anyone who opens his own eyes fully can then look through all other eyes. (For a
moment, George looks through the eyes of John Ehrlichman as Dick Nixon urges
lewdly, &quot;You can say I don't remember. You can say I can't recall. I can't
give any answer to that that I can recall.&quot; <i>I</i> <i>can't give any
answer to that that I can recall) </i>&quot;All flesh will see it in one
instant&quot;: who wrote that?</p>
<p>&quot;Gonna miss you, boy,&quot; the Sheriff said, offering an embarrassed
handshake. Numbly, George clasped the man's hot, reptilian palm.</p>
<p>The monk walked beside him up the gallows' steps. Thirteen, George was
thinking, there are always thirteen steps on a gallows. . . . And you always
cream in your jeans when your neck breaks. It has something to do with the
pressure on the spinal cord being transmitted through the prostate gland. The
Orgasm-Death Gimmick, Burroughs calls it.</p>
<p>At the fifth step, the monk said suddenly: &quot;Hail Eris.&quot;</p>
<p>George stared at the man dumbfounded. Who was Eris? Somebody in Greek
mythology, but somebody very important. . . .</p>
<p><i>&quot;It all depends on whether the fool has wisdom enough to repeat
it.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Quiet, idiot-he can hear us!&quot;</i></p>
<p>I got some bad pot, George decided, and I'm still back on the hotel bed,
hallucinating all this. But he repeated, uncertainly: &quot;Hail Eris.&quot;</p>
<p>Immediately, just like his one and only acid trip, dimension began to alter.
The steps grew larger, steeper-ascending them seemed as perilous as climbing
Mount Everest. The air was suddenly lit with reddish flame- <i>Definitely, </i>George
thought, <i>some weird and freaky pot. ...</i></p>
<p>And then, for some reason, he looked upward.</p>
<p>Each step was now higher than an ordinary building. He was near the bottom of
a pyramidal skyscraper of thirteen colossal levels. And at the top. . . . And at
the top....</p>
<p>And at the top One Enormous Eye-a ruby and demonic orb of cold fire, without
mercy or pity or contempt -looked at him and <i>into </i>him and through him.</p>
<p><i>The hand reaches down, turns on both bathtub faucets full-power, then
reaches upward to do the same to the sink faucets. Banana-Nose Maldonado leans
forward and whispers to Carmel, &quot;Now you can talk.&quot;</i></p>
<p>(The old man using the name &quot;Frank Sullivan&quot; was met, at Los
Angeles International Airport, November 22, 1963, by Mao Tsu-Hsi, who drove him
to his bungalow on Fountain Avenue. He gave his report in terse, unemotional
sentences. &quot;My God,&quot; she said when he finished, &quot;what do you make
of it?&quot; He thought carefully and grunted, &quot;It beats the hell out of
me. The guy on the triple underpass was definitely Harry Coin. I recognized him
through my binoculars. The guy in the window at the Book Depository very likely
was this galoot Oswald that they've arrested. The guy on the grassy knoll was
Bernard Barker from the CIA Bay of Pigs gang. But I didn't get a good look at
the gink on the County Records building. One thing I'm sure of: we can't keep
all this to ourselves. At the very least, we pass the word on to ELF. It might
alter their plans for OM. You've heard of OM?&quot; She nodded, saying,
&quot;Operation Mindfuck. It's their big project for the next decade or so. This
is a bigger Mindfuck than anything they had planned.&quot;)</p>
<p><i>&quot;Red China?&quot; Maldonado whispers incredulously. &quot;You musta
been reading the </i>Readers Digest. <i>We get all our horse from friendly
governments like Laos. The CIA would have our ass otherwise.&quot; Straining to
be heard over the running water, Carmel asks despondently, &quot;Then you don't
know how I could meet a Communist spy?&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>Maldonado stares at him levelly. &quot;Communism doesn't have a good image
right now,&quot; he says icily; it is April 3, two days after the Fernando Poo
Incident.</i></p>
<p>Bernard Barker, former servant of both Batista and Castro, dons his gloves
outside the Watergate; in a flash of memory he sees the grassy knoll, Oswald,
Harry Coin, and, further back, Castro negotiating with Banana-Nose Maldonado.</p>
<p>(But this present year, on March 24, Generalissimo Tequilla y Mota finally
found the book he was looking for, the one that was as precise and pragmatic
about running a country as Luttwak's <i>Coup d'Etat </i>had been about seizing
one. It was called <i>The Prince </i>and its author was a subtle Italian nam'ed
Machiavelli; it told the Generalissimo everything he wanted to know-except how
to handle American hydrogen bombs, which, unfortunately, Machiavelli had lived
too soon to foresee.)</p>
<p><i>&quot;It is our duty, our sacred duty to defend Fernando Poo,&quot; </i>Atlanta
Hope was telling a cheering crowd in Cincinnati that very day. &quot;Are we to
wait until the godless Reds are right here in Cincinnati?&quot; The crowd
started to scream their unwillingness to wait that long-they had been expecting
the godless Reds to arrive in Cincinnati since about 1945 and were, by now,
convinced that the dirty cowards were never going to come and would have to be
met on their own turf-but a group of dirty, longhaired, freaky-looking students
from Antioch College began to chant, &quot;I Don't Want to Die for Fernandoo Poo.&quot;
The crowd turned in fury: at last, some real reds to fight. . . . Seven
ambulances and thirty police cars were soon racing to scene....</p>
<p>(But only five years earlier Atlanta had a different message. When God's
Lightning was first founded, as a splinter off Women's Liberation, it had as its
slogan &quot;No More Sexism,&quot; and its original targets were adult
bookstores, sex-education programs, men's magazines, and foreign movies. It Was
only after meeting &quot;Smiling Jim&quot; Trepomena of Knights of Christianity
United in Faith that Atlanta discovered that both male supremacy and orgasms
were part of the International Communist Conspiracy. It was at that point,
really, that God's Lightning and orthodox Women's Lib totally parted company,
for the orthodox faction, just then, were teaching that male supremacy and
orgasms were part of the International Kapitalist Conspiracy.)</p>
<p>&quot;Fernando Poo,&quot; the President of the United States told reporters
even as Atlanta was calling for all-out war, &quot;will not become another Laos,
or another Costa Rica.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When are we going to get our troops out of Laos?&quot; a reporter from
the <i>New York Times </i>asked quickly; but a man from the <i>Washington Post </i>asked
just as rapidly, &quot;And when are we going to get our troops out of Costa
Rica?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our Present Plans for Withdrawal are going Forward according to an
Orderly Schedule,&quot; the President began; <i>but in Santa Isabel itself, </i>as
Tequilla y Mota underlined a passage in Machiavelli, <i>00005 concluded a
shortwave broadcast to a British submarine lying 17 miles off the coast of the
island: </i>&quot;The Yanks have gone absolutely bonkers, I'm afraid. I've been
here nine days now and I am absolutely convinced there is not one Russian or
Chinese agent in any way involved with Generalissimo Tequilla y Mota, nor are
there any troops of either of those governments hiding anywhere in the jungles.
However, BUGGER is definitely running a heroin smuggling ring here, and I would
like permission to investigate that.&quot; (The permission was to be denied; old
W., back at Intelligence HQ in London, knew that 00005 was a bit bonkers about
BUGGER himself and imagined that it was involved in every mission he undertook.)</p>
<p>At the same time, in a different hotel, Tobias Knight, on special loan from
the FBI to the CIA, concluded his nightly shortwave broadcast to an American
submarine 23 miles off the coast: &quot;The Russian troops are definitely
engaged in building what can only be a rocket-launching site, and the Slants are
constructing what seems to be a nuclear installation. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>And Hagbard Celine, lying 40 miles out in the Bight of Biafra in the <i>Lief
Erickson, </i>intercepted both messages, and smiled cynically, and wired P. in
New York: ACTIVATE MALIK AND PREPARE DORN.</p>
<p>(While the most obscure, seemingly trivial part of the whole puzzle appeared
in a department store in Houston. It was a sign that said:</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">NO SMOKING. NO SPITTING.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THE MGT.</span></b></p>
<p>This replaced an earlier sign that had hung on the main showroom wall for
many years, saying only</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">NO SMOKING</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THE MGT.</span></b></p>
<p>The change, although small, had subtle repercussions. The store catered only
to the very wealthy, and this clientele did not object to being told that they
could not smoke. The fire hazard, after all, was obvious. On the other hand,
that bit about spitting was somehow a touch offensive; they most certainly were
not the sort of people who would spit on somebody's floor-or, at least, none of
them had done such a thing at any time since about one month or at most one year
after they became wealthy. Yes, the sign was definitely bad diplomacy.
Resentment</p>
<p>festered. Sales fell off. And membership in the Houston branch of God's
Lightning increased. Wealthy, powerful membership.</p>
<p>(The odd thing was that the Management had nothing at all to do with the
sign.)</p>
<p>George Dora awoke screaming.</p>
<p>He lay on the floor of his cell in Mad Dog County Jail. His first frantic,
involuntary glance told him that Harry Coin had vanished completely from the
adjoining cell. The shit-pot was back in its corner and he knew, without being
able to check, that there would be no human intestines in it.</p>
<p>Terror tactics, he thought They were out to break him-a task which was
beginning to look easy-but they were covering up the evidence as they went
along.</p>
<p>There was no light through the cell window; it was, therefore, still night.
He hadn't slept but merely fainted.</p>
<p>Like a girl.</p>
<p>Like a long-haired commie faggot Oh, shit and prune juice, he told himself
sourly, cut it out. You've known for years that you're no hero. Don't take that
particular sore out and rub sandpaper on it now. You're not a hero, but you're a
goddam stubborn, pigheaded, and determined coward. That's why you've stayed
alive on assignments like this before.</p>
<p>Show these redneck mammyjammers just how stubborn, pig-headed, and determined
you can be.</p>
<p>George started with an old gimmick. A piece torn off the tail of his shirt
gave him a writing.tablet. The point of his shoelace became a temporary pen. His
own saliva, spat onto the polish of the shoes themselves, created a substitute
ink.</p>
<p>Laboriously, after a half hour, be had his message written:</p>
<p>WHOEVER FINDS THIS $50 TO CALL JOE MALIK,</p>
<p>NEW YORK CITY, AND TELL HIM GEORGE DORN</p>
<p>HELD WITHOUT LAWYER MAD DOG COUNTY</p>
<p>JAIL</p>
<p>The message shouldn't land too close to the jail, so George began looking for
a weighted object. In five minutes, he decided on a spring from the bunk
mattress; it took him seventeen minutes more to pry it loose.</p>
<p>After the missile was hurled out toe window-probably, George knew, to be
found by somebody who would immediately turn it over to Sheriff Jim
Cartwright-he began thinking of alternate plans.</p>
<p>He found, however, that instead of devising schemes for escape or
deliverance, his mind insisted on going off in an entirely different direction.
The face of the monk from his dream pursued him. He had seen that face somewhere
before, he knew; but where? Somehow, the question was important. He began trying
in earnest to re-create the face and identify it-James Joyce, H. P. Lovecraft,
and a monk in a painting by Fra Angelico all came to mind. It was none of them,
but it looked somehow a little like each of them.</p>
<p>Suddenly tired and discouraged, George slouched back on the bunk and let his
hand lightly clutch his penis through his trousers. Heroes of fiction don't jack
off when the going gets rough, he reminded himself. Well, hell, he wasn't a hero
and this wasn't fiction. Besides, I wasn't going to jack-off (after all, They
might be watching through a peephole, ready to use this natural jailhouse
weakness to humiliate me further and break my ego). No, I definitely wasn't
going to jack-off: I was just going to hold it, lightly, through my trousers,
until I felt some life-force surging back into my body and displacing fear,
exhaustion and despair. Meanwhile, I thought about Pat back in New York. She was
wearing nothing but her cute black lace bra and panties, and her nipples are
standing up pointy and hard. Make it Sophia Loren, and take the bra off so I can
see the nipples directly. Ah, yes, and now try it the other way: she (Sophia, no
make it Pat again) is wearing the bra but the panties are off showing the pubic
bush. Let her play with it, get her fingers in there, and the other hand on a
nipple, ah, yes, and now she (Pat-no, Sophia) is kneeling to unzipper my fly. My
penis grew harder and her mouth opened in expectation. I reached down and cupped
her breast with one hand, taking the nipple she had been caressing, feeling it
harden more. (Did James Bond ever do this in Doctor No's dungeon?) Sophia's
tongue (not my hand, <i>not </i>my hand) is busy and hot, sending pulsations
through my entire body. Take it, you cunt. Take it, O God, a flash of the
Passaic and the gun at my forehead, and you can't call them cunts nowadays, ah,
you cunt, you cunt, take it, and it is Pat, it's that night at her pad when we
were both zonked on hashish and I never never never had a blow-job like that
before or since, my hands were in her hair, gripping her shoulders, take it,
suck me off (get out of my head, mother), and her mouth is wet and rhythmic and
my cock is just as sensitive as that night zonked on the hash, and I pulled the
trigger and then the explosion came just as I did (pardon the diction) and I was
on the floor coughing and bouncing, my eyes watering. The second blast lifted me
again and threw me with a crunch against the wall.</p>
<p>Then the machine-gun fire started.</p>
<p>Jesus H. Particular Christ on a crutch, I thought frantically, whatever it is
that's happening they're going to find me with come on the front of my trousers.</p>
<p>And every bone in my body broken, I think.</p>
<p>The machine gun suddenly stopped stuttering and I thought I heard a voice cry
&quot;Earwicker, Bloom and Craft.&quot;-I've still got Joyce on my mind, I
decided. Then the third explosion came, and I covered my head as parts of the
ceiling began falling on me.</p>
<p>A key suddenly clanked against his cell door. Looking up, I saw a young woman
in a trench coat, carrying a tommy gun, and desperately trying one key after
another in the lock.</p>
<p>From somewhere else in the building there came a fourth explosion.</p>
<p>The woman grinned tensely at the sound. &quot;Commie motherfuckers,&quot; she
muttered, still trying keys.</p>
<p>&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; I finally asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind that now,&quot; she snapped. &quot;We've come to rescue
you-isn't that enough?&quot;</p>
<p>Before I could think of a reply, the door swung open.</p>
<p>&quot;Quick,&quot; she said, &quot;this way.&quot;</p>
<p>I limped after her down the hall. Suddenly she stopped, studied the wall a
moment, and pressed against a brick. The wall slid smoothly aside and we entered
what appeared to be a chapel of some sort.</p>
<p>Good weeping Jesus and his brother Irving, I thought, I'm <i>still </i>still
dreaming.</p>
<p>For the chapel was not anything that a sane man would expect to find in Mad
Dog County Jail. Decorated entirely in red and white-the colors of Hassan i
Sabbah and the Assassins of Alamout, I remembered incredulously-it was adorned
with strange Arabic symbols and slogans in</p>
<p>German: <i>&quot;Heute die Welt, M or gens das Sonnensystem,&quot; &quot;Ewige
Blumenkraft Und Ewige Schlangekraft!&quot; &quot;Gestern Hanf, Heute Hanf, Immer
Hanf.&quot;</i></p>
<p>And the altar was a pyramid with thirteen ledges-with a ruby-red eye at the
top.</p>
<p>This symbol, I now recalled with mounting confusion, was the Great Seal of
the United States.</p>
<p>'This way,&quot; the woman said, motioning with her tommy gun.</p>
<p>We passed through another sliding wall and found ourselves in an alley behind
the jail.</p>
<p>A black Cadillac awaited us. &quot;Everybody's out!&quot; the driver shouted.
He was an old man, more than sixty, but hard and shrewd-looking.</p>
<p>&quot;Good,&quot; the woman said. &quot;Here's George.&quot;</p>
<p>I was pushed into the back seat-which was already full of grim-looking men
and grimmer-looking munitions of various sorts-and the car started at once.</p>
<p>&quot;One for good measure,&quot; the woman in the trench coat shouted and
threw another plastic bomb back at the jail.</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; the driver said. &quot;It fits, too-that makes ft
five.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Law of Fives,&quot; another passenger chuckled bitterly.
&quot;Serves the commie bastards right. A taste of their own medicine.&quot;</p>
<p>I could restrain myself no longer.</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; I demanded. &quot;Who are you people?
What makes you think Sheriff Cartwright and his police are communists? And where
are you taking me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up,&quot; said the woman who had unlocked my cell, nudging me none
too affectionately with her machine gun. &quot;We'll talk when we're ready.
Meanwhile, wipe the come off your pants.&quot;</p>
<p>The car sped into the night.</p>
<p>(In a Bentley limousine, Fedrico &quot;Banana Nose&quot; Mal-donado drew on
his cigar and relaxed as his chauffeur drove him toward Robert Putney Drake's
mansion in Blue Point, Long Island. In back of his eyes, almost forgotten,
Charlie &quot;The Bug&quot; Workman, Mendy Weiss, and Jimmy the Shrew listen
soberly, on October 23, 1935, as Banana Nose tells them: &quot;Don't give the
Dutchman a chance. Cowboy the son of a bitch.&quot; The three guns nod stolidly;
cowboying somebody is messy, but it pays well. In an ordinary hit, you can be
precise, even artistic, because after all the only thing that matters is that
the person so honored should be definitely dead afterwards. Cowboying, in the
language of the profession, leaves no room for personal taste or delicacy: the
important thing is that there should be a lot of lead in the air and the victim
should leave a spectacularly gory corpse for the tabloids, as notification that
the Brotherhood is both edgy and short-tempered and everybody better watch his
ass. Although it wasn't obligatory, it was considered a sign of true enthusiasm
on a cowboy job if the guest of honor took along a few innocent bystanders, so
everybody would understand exactly how edgy the Brotherhood was feeling. The
Dutchman took two such bystanders. And in a different world that is still this
world, Albert &quot;The Teacher&quot; Stern opens his morning paper on July 23,
1934, and reads FBI SHOOTS DILLINGER, thinking wistfully <i>If I</i> <i>could
kill somebody that important, my name would never be forgotten. </i>Further
back, back further: February 7, 1932, Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll looks
through the phone-booth door and sees a familiar face crossing the drugstore and
a tommy-gun in the man's hand. &quot;The god-damned pig-headed Dutchman,&quot;
he howled, but nobody heard him because the Thompson gun was already
systematically spraying the phone-booth up and down, right and left, left and
right, and up and down again for good measure . . . But tilt the picture another
way and-this emerges: On November 10, 1948, the &quot;World's Greatest
Newspaper,&quot; the <i>Chicago Tribune </i>announced the election to the
Presidency of the United States of America of Thomas Dewey, a man who not only
was not elected but would not even have been alive if Banana Nose Maldonado had
not given such specific instructions concerning the Dutchman to Charlie the Bug,
Mendy Weiss and Jimmy the Shrew.)</p>
<p><i>Who shot you? </i>the police stenographer asked. <i>Mother is the best
bet, Oh mama mama mama. I want harmony. 1 don't want harmony, </i>is the
delirious answer. <i>Who shot you? </i>the question is repeated. The Dutchman
still replies: <i>Oh mama mama mama. French Canadian bean soup.</i></p>
<p>We drove till dawn. The car stopped on a road by a beach of white sand. Tall,
skinny palm trees stood black against a turquoise sky. This must be the Gulf of
Mexico, I thought. They could now load me with chains and drop me in the gulf,
hundreds of miles from Mad Dog, without</p>
<p>involving Sheriff Jim. No, they had raided Sheriff Jim's jail. Or was that a
hallucination? I was going to have to keep more of an eye on reality. This was a
new day, and I was going to know facts hard and sharp-edged in the sunlight and
keep them straight.</p>
<p>I was stiff and sore and tired from a night of driving. The only rest I'd
gotten was fitful dozing in which cy-clopean ruby eyes looked at me till I awoke
in terror. Mavis, the woman with the tommy gun, had put her arms around me
several times when I screamed. She would murmur soothingly to me, and once her
lips, smooth, cool and soft, had brushed my ear.</p>
<p>At the beach, Mavis motioned me out of the car. The sun was as hot as the
bishop's jock strap when he finished his sermon on the evils of pornography. She
stepped out behind me and slammed the door.</p>
<p>&quot;We wait here,&quot; she said. &quot;The others go back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are we waiting for?&quot; I asked. Just then the driver of the car
gunned the motor. The car swung round in a wide U-turn. In a minute its rear end
had disappeared beyond a bend in the Gulf highway. We were alone with the rising
sun and the sand-strewn asphalt.</p>
<p>Mavis motioned me to walk down the beach with her. A little ways ahead, far
back from the water, was a small white-painted frame cabana. A woodpecker landed
wearily on its roof like he had flown more missions than Yossarian and never
intended to go up again.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the plan, Mavis? A private execution on a lonely beach in
another state so Sheriff Jim can't get blamed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be a dummy, George. We blew up that commie bastard's jail.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you keep calling Sheriff Cartwright a commie? If ever a man had
KKK written all over his forehead, it was that reactionary redneck prick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you know your Trotsky? 'Worse is better.' Slobs like Cartwright
are trying to discredit America to make it ripe for a left-wing takeover.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a left-winger. If you're against commies, you've got to be against
me.&quot; I didn't care to tell her about my other friends in Weatherman and
Morituri.</p>
<p>&quot;You're just a liberal dupe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not a liberal, I'm a militant radical.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A radical is nothing but a liberal with a big mouth.</p>
<p>And a militant radical is nothing but a big-mouthed liberal with a Che
costume. Balls. We're the real radicals, George. We do things, like last night
Except for Weatherman and Morituri, all the militant radicals in your crowd ever
do is take out the Molotov cocktail diagram that they carefully clipped from <i>The
New York Review of Books, </i>hang it on the bathroom door and jack-off in
connection with it. No offense meant.&quot; The woodpecker turned his head and
watched us suspiciously like a paranoid old man.</p>
<p>&quot;And what are your politics, if you're such a radical?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that government governs best of all that governs least of
all. Preferably <i>not </i>at all. And I believe in the laissez faire capitalist
economic system.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you must hate my politics. Why did you rescue me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're wanted,&quot; she said. &quot;By whom?&quot; &quot;Hagbard
Celine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who is Hagbard Celine?&quot; We had reached the cabana and were
standing beside it, facing each other, glaring at each other. The woodpecker
turned his head and looked at us with the other eye.</p>
<p>&quot;What is John Guilt?&quot; Mavis said. I might have guessed, I thought,
a Hope fiend. She went on, &quot;It took a whole book to answer that one. As for
Hagbard, you'll learn by seeing. Enough for now that you know that he's the man
who requested that we rescue you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you personally don't like me and would not have gone out of your
way to help me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know about not liking you. That splotch of come on your
trousers has had me horny ever since Mad Dog. Also the excitement of the raid.
I've got some tension to burn off. I'd prefer to save myself for a man who
completely meets the criteria of my value system. But I could get awfully horny
waiting for him. No regrets, no guilt, though. You're all right. You'll
do.&quot; &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; &quot;I'm talking about your
fucking me, George.&quot; &quot;I never knew a girl-I mean woman-who believed in
the capitalist system who was any kind of a good fuck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What has your pathetic circle of acquaintances got to do with the price
of gold? I doubt you ever met a woman who believed in the real laissez faire
capitalist system. Such a woman is not likely to be caught traveling in your
left-liberal circles.&quot; She took me by the hand and led me into the cabana.
She shrugged out of her trench coat and spread it carefully on the floor. She
was wearing a black sweater and a pair of blue jeans, both tight-fitting. She
pulled the sweater off over her head. She was wearing no bra, and her breasts
were apple-sized cherry-tipped cones. There was some sort of dark red birthmark
between them. &quot;Your kind of capitalist woman was a Nixonette in 1972, and
she believes in that half-ass corporate socialist bastard fascist mixed economy
Frank Roosevelt blessed these United States with.&quot; She unbuckled her wide
black belt and unzipped her jeans. She tugged them down over her hips. I felt my
hardon swelling up inside my pants. &quot;Libertarian women are good fucks,
because they know what they want, and what they want they like a lot.&quot; She
stepped out of her jeans to reveal, of all things, panties made of some strange
metallic-looking synthetic material that was gold in color.</p>
<p>How can I know facts hard and sharp-edged in the sunlight and keep them
straight when this happens? &quot;You really want me to fuck you right now on
this public beach in broad daylight?&quot; The woodpecker went to work above us
just then, banging away like a rock drummer, I suddenly remembered from high
school:</p>
<p>The Woodpecker pecked on the out-house door; He pecked and he pecked till his
pecker was sore....</p>
<p>&quot;George, you're too serious. Don't you know how to play? Did you ever
think that life is maybe a game? There is no difference between life and a game,
you know. When you play, for instance, playing with a toy, there is no winning
or losing. Life is a toy, George, I'm a toy. Think of me as a doll. Instead of
sticking pins in me, you can stick your thing in me. Fm a magic doll, like a
voodoo doll. A doll is a work of art. Art is magic. You make an image of the
thing you want to possess or cope with, so you can cope with it. You make a
model, so you have it under control. Dig? Don't you want to possess me? You can,
but just for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &quot;I can't believe you. The way you're talking-it's not
real&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I always talk like this when I'm horny. It happens that at such times
I'm more open to the vibrations from outer space. George, are unicorns real? Who
made unicorns? Is a thought about unicorns a real thought? How is it different
from the mental picture of my pussy-which you've never seen-that you've got in
your head at this minute? Does the fact that you can think of fucking me and I
can think of fucking with you mean we <i>are </i>going to fuck? Or is the
universe going to surprise us? Wisdom is wearying, folly is fun. What does a
horse with a single long horn sticking straight out of its head mean to
you?&quot;</p>
<p>My eyes went from the pubic bulge under her gold panties, where they'd
strayed when she said &quot;pussy,&quot; to the mark between her breasts.</p>
<p>It wasn't a birthmark. I felt like a bucket of ice water hit my groin.</p>
<p>I pointed. &quot;What does a red eye inside a red-and-white triangle mean to
you?&quot;</p>
<p>Her open hand slammed against my jaw. &quot;Motherfucker! Never speak to me
about that!&quot;</p>
<p>Then she bowed her head. &quot;I'm sorry, George. I had no right to do that.
Hit me back, if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want. But I'm afraid you've turned me off sexually.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense. You're a healthy man. But now I want to give you something
without taking anything from you.&quot; She knelt before me on her trench coat,
her knees parted, unzipped my fly, reached in with quick, tickling fingers, and
pulled my penis out. She slipped her mouth around it. It was my jail fantasy
coming true.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you <i>doing?&quot;</i></p>
<p>She took her lips away from my penis, and I looked down and saw that the head
was shiny with saliva and swelling visibly in rapid throbs. Her breasts-my
glance avoided the Masonic tattoo-were somewhat fuller, and the nipples stuck
out erect.</p>
<p>She smiled. &quot;Don't whistle while you're pissing, George, and don't ask
questions when you're getting blowed. Shut up and get hard. This is just quid
pro quo.&quot;</p>
<p>When I came I didn't feel much juice jetting out through my penis; I'd used a
lot up whacking off in jail. I noted with pleasure that what there was of it she
didn't spit out. She smiled and swallowed it.</p>
<p>The sun was higher and hotter in the sky and the woodpecker celebrated by
drumming faster and harder. The Gulf sparkled like Mrs. Aster's best diamonds. I
peered out at the water: just below the horizon there was a flash of gold among
the diamonds.</p>
<p>Mavis suddenly struck her legs out in front of her and dropped onto her back.
&quot;George! I can't give without taking. Please, quick, while it's still hard,
get down here and slip it to me.&quot;</p>
<p>I looked down. Her lips were trembling. She was tugging the gold panties away
from her black-escutcheoned crotch. My wet cock was already beginning to droop.
I looked down at her and grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't like <i>girls </i>who slap you one
minute and get the hots for you the next minute. They don't meet the criteria of
<i>my </i>value system. I think they're nuts.&quot; Carefully and deliberately I
stuffed my pecker back into my trousers and stepped away from her. It was sore
anyway, like in the ryhme.</p>
<p>&quot;You're not such a schmuck after all, you bastard,&quot; she said
through gritted teeth. Her hand was moving rapidly between her legs. In a moment
she arched her back, eyes clenched tight, and emitted a little scream, like a
baby seagull out on its first flight, a strangely virginal sound.</p>
<p>She lay relaxed for a moment, then picked herself up off the cabana floor and
started to dress. She glanced out at the water and I followed her eyes. She
pointed at the distant glint of gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard's here.&quot;</p>
<p>A buzzing sound floated across the water. After a moment, I spotted a small
black motorboat coming toward us. We watched in silence as the boat grounded its
bow on the white beach. Mavis motioned at me, and I followed her down the sand
to the water's edge. There was a man in a black turtleneck sweater sitting in
the stern of the boat. Mavis climbed in the bow and turned to me with a
questioning look. The woodpecker felt bad vibes and took off with a flapping and
cawing like the omen of Doom.</p>
<p>What the hell am I getting into, and why am I so crazy as to go along? I
tried to see what it was out there that the motorboat had come from, but the sun
on the gold metal was flashing blindingly and I couldn't make out a shape. I
looked back at the black motorboat and saw that there was a circular gold object
painted on the bow and there was a little black flag flying at the stern with
the</p>
<p>same gold object in its center. I pointed at the emblem on the bow.</p>
<p>&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An apple,&quot; said Mavis.</p>
<p>People who chose a golden apple as their symbol couldn't be all bad. I jumped
into the boat, and its pilot used an oar to push off. We buzzed over the smooth
water of the Gulf toward the golden object on the horizon. It was still blinding
from reflected sunlight, but I was now able to make out a long, low silhouette
with a small tower in the center, like a matchbox on top of a broomstick. Then I
realized that I had my judgment of distances wrong. The ship, or whatever it
was, was much more distant than I'd first realized.</p>
<p>It was a submarine-a golden submarine-and it appeared to be the equivalent of
five city blocks long, as big as the biggest ocean liner I had ever heard of.
The conning tower was about three stories high. As we drew up beside it I saw a
man on the tower waving to us. Mavis waved back. I waved halfheartedly,
supposing somehow that it was the thing to do. I was still thinking about that
Masonic tattoo.</p>
<p>A hatch opened in the submarine's side, and the little motorboat floated
right in. The hatch closed, the water drained out, and the boat settled into a
cradle. Mavis pointed to a door that looked like an entrance to an elevator.</p>
<p>&quot;You go that way,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll see you later, maybe.&quot;
She pressed a button and the door opened, revealing a carpeted gilt cage. I
stepped in and was whisked up three stories. The door opened and I stepped out
into a small room where a man was waiting, standing with a grace that reminded
me of a Hindu or an American Indian. I thought at once of Metternich's remark
about Talleyrand: &quot;If somebody kicked him in the backside, not a muscle
would move in his face until he decided what to do.&quot;</p>
<p>He bore a striking resemblance to Anthony Quinn; he had thick black eyebrows,
olive skin, and a strong nose and jaw. He was big and burly, powerful muscles
bulging under his black-and-green striped nautical sweater. He held out his
hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Good, George. You made it I'm Hagbard Celine.&quot;</p>
<p>We shook hands; he had a grip like King Kong. &quot;Welcome aboard the <i>Lief
Erickson, </i>named after the first European to reach America from the Atlantic
side, may my Italian ancestors forgive me. Fortunately, I have Viking ancestors,
as well. My mother is Norwegian. However, blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin
are all recessive. My Sicilian father creamed my mother in the genes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where the hell did you get this ship? I wouldn't have believed a
submarine like this could exist without the whole world knowing about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The sub's my creation, built in accordance with my design in a
Norwegian fjord. This is what the liberated mind can do. I am the
twentieth-century Leonardo, except that I'm not gay. I've tried it, of course,
but women interest me more. The world has never heard of Hagbard Celine. That is
because the world is stupid and Celine is very smart. The submarine is radar and
sonar transparent. It is superior to the best either the American or Russian
government even has on the drawing board. It can go to any depth in any ocean.
We've sounded the Atlantic Trench, the Mindinao Deep, and a few holes in the
floor of the sea that no one's ever heard of or named. <i>Lief Erickson </i>is
capable of meeting the biggest, most ferocious, and smartest monsters of the
deep, of which we've found God's plenty. I'd even risk her in battle with
Leviathan himself, though I'm just as pleased that we've only seen him from afar
hitherto.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean whales?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean leviathan, man. That fish-if fish it be-that is to your whale
what your whale is to your meanest guppy. Don't ask me what Leviathan is-I
haven't even gotten close enough to tell you his shape. There's only one of him,
her, or it in all that world that's water. I don't know how it reproduces-maybe
it doesn't have to reproduce-maybe it's immortal. It may be neither plant nor
animal for all I know, but it's alive, and it's the biggest living thing there
is. Oh, we've seen monsters, George. We've seen, in <i>Lief Erickson, </i>the
sunken ruins of Atlantis and Lemuria-or Mu, as it's known to keepers of the
Sacred Chao.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot; I asked, wondering if I was
in some crazy surrealist movie, wandering from telepathic sheriffs to homosexual
assassins, to nympho lady Masons, to psychotic pirates, according to a script
written in advance by two acid-heads and a Martian humorist.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm talking about adventure, George. I'm talking about seeing things
and being with people that will really liberate your mind-not just replacing
liberalism with Marxism so you can shock your parents. I'm talking about getting
altogether off the grubby plane you live on and taking a trip with Hagbard to a
transcendental universe. Did you know that on sunken Atlantis there is a.
pyramidal structure built by ancient priests and faced with a ceramic substance
that has withstood thirty thousand years of ocean burial so that the pyramid is
clean and white as polished ivory-except for the giant red mosaic of an eye at
its top?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I find it hard to believe that Atlantis ever existed,&quot; I said.
&quot;In fact&quot;-I shook my head angrily-&quot;you're conning me into
qualifying that. The fact is I simply don't believe Atlantis ever existed. This
is pure bullshit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Atlantis is where we're going next, friend. Do you trust the evidence
of your senses? I hope so, because you'll see Atlantis and the pyramid, just as
I said. Those bastards, the Illuminati, are trying to get gold to further their
conspiracies by looting an Atlantean temple. And Hagbard is going to foil them
by robbing it first. Because I fight the Illuminati every chance I get. And
because I'm an amateur archeologist. Will you join us? You're free to leave
right now, if you wish. I'll put you ashore and even supply you with money to
get back to New York.&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &quot;I'm a writer. I write magazine articles for a living.
And even if ninety percent of what you say is bullshit, moonshine, and the most
elaborate put-on since Richard Nixon, this is the best story I've ever come
across. A nut with a gigantic golden submarine whose followers include beautiful
guerrilla women who blow up southern jails and take out the prisoners. No, I'm
not leaving. You're too big a fish to let get away.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard Celine slapped me on the shoulder. &quot;Good man. You've got courage
and initiative. You trust only the evidence of your eyes and believe what no man
tells you. I was right about you. Come on down to my stateroom.&quot; He pressed
a button and we entered the golden elevator and sank rapidly till we came to an
eight-foot-high archway barred by a silver gate. Celine pressed a button and the
elevator door and the gate outside both slid back. We stepped out into a
carpeted room with a lovely black woman sitting at one end under an elaborate
emblem concocted of anchors, seashells, Viking figureheads, lions, ropes,
octopi, lightning bolts, and, occupying the central position, a golden apple.</p>
<p>&quot;Kallisti,&quot; said Celine, saluting the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;All hail Discordia,&quot; she answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Aum Shiva,&quot; I contributed, trying to enter the spirit of the game.</p>
<p>Celine led me down a long corridor, saying, &quot;You'll find this submarine
is opulently furnished. I have no need to live in monklike surroundings like
those masochists who become naval officers. No Spartan simplicity for me. This
is more like an ocean liner or a grand European hotel of the Edwardian era. Wait
till you see my suite. You'll like your stateroom, too. To please myself, I
built this thing on the grand scale. No finicky naval architects or parsimonious
accountants in my business. I believe you've got to spend money to make money
and spend the money you make to enjoy money. Besides, I have to live in the
damned thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what precisely is your business, Mr. Celine?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Or should I call you Captain Celine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should certainly not. No bullshit authority titles for me. I'm
Freeman Hagbard Celine, but the conventional Mister is good enough. I'd prefer
you called me by my first name. Hell, call me anything you want to. If I don't
like it, I'll punch you in the nose. If there were more bloody noses, there'd be
fewer wars. I'm in smuggling mostly. With a spot of piracy, just to keep
ourselves on our toes. But that only against the Illuminati and their communist
dupes. We aim to prove that no state has the right to regulate commerce in any
way. Nor can it, when it is up against free men. My crew are all volunteers. We
have among us liberated sailors who were indentured to the navies of America,
Russia, and China. Excellent fellows. The governments of the world will never
catch us, because free men are always cleverer than slaves, and any man who
works for a government is a slave.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you're a gang of Objectivists, basically? I've got to warn you, I
come from a long line of labor agitators and Reds. You'll never convert me to a
right-wing position.&quot;</p>
<p>Celine reared back as if I had waved offal under his nose.
&quot;Objectivists?&quot; he pronounced the word as if I had accused him of
being a child-molester. &quot;We're anarchists and outlaws, goddam it. Didn't
you understand that much? We've got nothing to do with right-wing, left-wing or
any other half-assed political category. If you work within the system, you come
to one of the either/or choices that were implicit in the system from the
beginning. You're talking like a medieval serf, asking the first agnostic
whether he worships God or the Devil. We're outside the system's categories.
You'll never get the hang of our game <i>if </i>you keep thinking in flat-earth
imagery of right and left, good and evil, up and down. If you need a group label
for us, we're political non-Euclideans. But even that's not true. Sink me,
nobody of this tub agrees with anybody else about anything, except maybe what
the fellow with the horns told the old man in the clouds: <i>Non serviam.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;I </i>don't know Latin,&quot; I said, overwhelmed by his outburst.</p>
<p>&quot;'I will not serve,'&quot; he translated. &quot;And here's your
room.&quot;</p>
<p>He threw open an oaken door, and I entered a living room furnished in
handsome teak and rosewood Scandinavian, upholstered in bright solid colors. He
hadn't been exaggerating about the scale: you could have parked a Greyhound bus
in the middle of the carpet and the room would still seem uncluttered. Above an
orange couch hung a huge oil painting in an elaborate gilt frame easily a foot
deep on all sides. The painting was essentially a cartoon. It showed a man in
robes with long, flowing white hair and beard standing on a mountaintop staring
in astonishment at a wall of black rock. Above his head a fiery hand traced
flaming letters with its index finger on the rock. The words it wrote were:</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THINK FOR YOURSELF, SCHMUCK!</span></b></p>
<p>As I started to laugh, I felt, through the soles of my feet, an enormous
engine beginning to throb.</p>
<p>And, in Mad Dog, Jim Cartwright said into a phone with a scrambler device to
evade taps, &quot;We let Celine's crowd take Dorn, according to plan, and, Harry
Coin is, ah, no longer with us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good,&quot; said Atlanta Hope. 'The Four are heading for Ingolstadt.
Everything is GO.&quot; She hung up and dialed again at once, reaching Western
Union. &quot;I want a flat rate telegram, same words, twenty-three different
addresses,&quot; she said crisply. &quot;The message is, 'Insert the
advertisement in tomorrow's newspapers.' Signature, 'Atlanta Hope.'&quot; She
then read off the twenty-three addresses, each located in a large city in the
United States, each a regional headquarters of God's Lightning. (The following
day, April 25, the newspapers in those cities ran an obscure ad in the personals
columns; it said &quot;In thanks to Saint Jude for favors granted. A.W.&quot;
The plot, accordingly, thickened.)</p>
<p>And then I sat back and thought about Harry Coin. Once I imagined I could
make it with him: there was something so repulsive, so cruel, so wild and
psychopathic there . . . but, of course, it hadn't worked. The same as every
other man. Nothing. &quot;Hit me,&quot; I screamed. &quot;Bite me. Hurt me. <i>Do
something.&quot; </i>He did everything, the most agreeable sadist in the world,
but it was the same as if be had been the gentlest, most poetic English
instructor at Antioch. Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. . . . The closest
miss was that strange banker, Drake, from Boston. What a scene. I'd gotten into
his office on Wall Street, seeking a contribution for God's Lightning. Old
white-haired buzzard, between sixty and seventy: typical of our wealthier
members, I thought. I started the usual spiel, communism, sexism, smut, and all
the time his eyes were bright and hard as a snake's. It finally hit me that he
didn't believe a word of it, so I started to cut it off, and then he pulled out
his checkbook and wrote and held it up so I could see it. Twenty thousand
dollars. I didn't know what to say, and I started something about how all true
Americans would appreciate this great gesture and so on, and he said,
&quot;Rubbish. You're not rich but you're famous. I want to add you to my
collection. Deal?&quot; The coldest bastard I ever met, even Harry Coin was
human by comparison, yet his eyes were such a clear blue I couldn't believe they
could be so frightening, a real madman in a perfectly sane way, not even a
psychopath but something they don't have a name for, and it clicked, the
humiliation of whoredom and the predatory viciousness in his face plus the
twenty grand; I nodded. He took me into a private suite off of his business
office and he touched one button, the lights dimmed, another button, down came a
movie screen, a third button, and I was watching a pornographic movie. He didn't
approach me, just watched, and</p>
<p>I tried to get excited, wondering if the actress was really making it or just
faking it, and then a second film began, four of them this time in permutations
and combinations, he led me to the couch, every time I opened my eyes I could
still see the film over his shoulder, and it was the same, the same, as soon as
he got his thing inside me, nothing, nothing, nothing, I kept looking at the
actors trying to feel something, and then, as he came, be whispered in my ear, <i>&quot;Heute
die Welt, Morgans das Sonnen-system!&quot; </i>That was the only time I almost
made it Sheer terror that this maniac <i>knew. . . .</i></p>
<p>Later, I tried to find out about him, but nobody above me in the Order would
say a word, and those below me didn't know anything. But I finally found out: he
was very big in the Syndicate, maybe the top. And that's how I figured out that
the old rumor was true, the Syndicate was run by the Order, too, just like
everything else. . . .</p>
<p>But that cold sinister old man never said another word about it. I kept
waiting while we dressed, when he gave me the check, when he escorted me to the
door, and even his expression seemed to deny that he had said it or knew what it
meant. When he opened the door for me, he put an arm on my shoulder and spoke,
so his secretary could hear it, &quot;May your work hasten the day when America
returns to purity.&quot; Even his eyes weren't mocking and his voice sounded
completely sincere. And yet he had read me to the core, knew I was faking, and
guessed that terror alone could unlock my reflexes: maybe he even knew that I
had already tried physical sadism and it hadn't worked. Out on Wall Street in
the crowd, I saw a man with a gas maskthey were still rare that yearand I
felt the whole world was moving faster than I could understand and that the
Order wasn't telling me nearly as much as I needed to know.</p>
<p>Brother Beghard, who is actually a politician in Chicago under his
&quot;real&quot; name, once explained the Law of Fives to me in relation to the
pyramid-of-power principle. Intellectually, I understand: it's the only way we
can work, each group a separate vector so that the most any infiltrator can
learn is a small part of the design. Emotionally, though, it does get
frightening at times: do the Five at the top really have the whole picture? I
don't know, and I don't see how they can predict a man like Drake or guess what
he's planning next There's a paradox here, I know:</p>
<p>I joined the Order seeking power, and now I am more a tool, an object, than
ever before. If a man like Drake ever thought that, he might tear the whole show
apart.</p>
<p>Unless the Five really do have the powers they claim; but I'm not gullible
enough to believe that bull. Some of it's hypnotism, and some is plain old stage
magic, but none of it is really supernatural. Nobody has sold me on a fairy tale
since my uncle got into me when I was twelve with his routine about stopping the
bleeding. If my parents had only told me the truth about menstruation in advance
...</p>
<p>Enough of that. There was work to be done. I hit the buzzer on my desk and my
secretary, Mr. Mortimer, came in. As I'd guessed, it was past nine o'clock and
he'd been out there in the reception area straightening up and worrying about my
mood for God knows how long, while I was daydreaming. I studied my memo pad,
while he waited apprehensively. Finally, I noticed him and said, &quot;Be
seated.&quot; He sank into the dictation chair, putting his head right under the
point of the lightning bolt on the wallan effect I always enjoyedand
opened his pad.</p>
<p>&quot;Call Zev Hirsch in New York,&quot; I said watching his pencil fly to
keep up with my words. &quot;The Foot Fetishist Liberation Front is having a
demonstration. Tell bun to <i>cream </i>them; I won't be satisfied unless a
dozen of the perverts are put in the hospital, and I don't care how many of our
people get arrested doing it The bail fund is available, <i>if </i>they need it.
If Zev has any objections, I'll talk to him, but otherwise you handle it. Then
make up the standard number-two press release, where I deny any knowledge of
illegal activities-by that chapter and promise we will investigate and expel
anybody guilty of mob action have that ready for release this afternoon. Then
get me the latest sales figures on <i>Telemachus Sneezed. . . .&quot; </i>Another
busy day at the national headquarters of God's Lightning was started; and
Hagbard Celine, feeding Mavis's report on George's sexual and other behavior
into FUCKUP, came out with a coding of C-1472-B-2317A, which caused him to laugh
immoderately.</p>
<p>&quot;What's so damned funny?&quot; Mavis asked.</p>
<p>&quot;From out of the west come the thundering hooves of the great horse,
Onan,&quot; Hagbard grinned. &quot;The lonely stranger rides again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell does all that mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We've got sixty-four thousand possible personality types,&quot; Hagbard
explained, &quot;and I've only seen that reading once before. Guess who it
was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not me,&quot; Mavis said quickly, beginning to color.</p>
<p>&quot;No, not you.&quot; Hagbard laughed again. &quot;It was Atlanta
Hope.&quot;</p>
<p>Mavis was startled. &quot;That's impossible. She's frigid for one
thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are many kinds of frigidity,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;It fits,
believe me. She joined women's liberation at the same age George joined
Weatherman, and they both split after a few months. And you'd be surprised how
similar their mothers were, or how the successful careers of their older
brothers annoy them&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But George is a nice guy, underneath it all.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard Celine knocked an ash off his long Italian cigar. &quot;Everybody is
a nice guy, underneath it all,&quot; he said. &quot;What we become when the
world is through messing us over is something else.&quot;</p>
<p>At Chateau Thierry, in 1918, Robert Putney Drake looked around at the dead
bodies, knew he was the last man alive in the platoon, and heard the Germans
start to advance. He felt the cold wetness on his thighs before he realized he
was urinating in his pants; a shell exploded nearby and he sobbed. &quot;O God,
please, Jesus. Don't let them kill me. I'm afraid to die. Please, Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus . . .&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Lou and Simon are eating breakfast in bed, still naked as Adam and Eve.
Mary Lou spread jam on toast and asked, &quot;No, seriously: which part was
hallucination and which part was real?&quot;</p>
<p>Simon sipped at his coffee. &quot;Everything in life is a
hallucination,&quot; he said simply. &quot;Everything in death, too,&quot; he
added. &quot;The universe is just putting us on. Handing us a line.&quot;</p>
