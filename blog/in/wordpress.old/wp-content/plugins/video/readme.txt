Manage and embed videos hosted on VideoPress. Requires a WordPress.com blog with the VideoPress premium upgrade.

== Description ==

Add VideoPress videos stored on WordPress.com to your self-hosted WordPress.org site through the use of simple shortcodes. Edit video metadata directly from your blog's administrative interface.

The VideoPress plugin allows blog administrators to upload new videos to their WordPress.com video account and manage existing videos from the convenience of their self-hosted WordPress.org blog's administrative interface. Authors can add any VideoPress video into a blog post through the use of a simple shortcode and customizations.

This plugin allows you to click a button to login to your WordPress.com video blog, retrieve a video's `[videopress xyz]` shortcode, and insert it into your post. 
You can specify the width and height of the video container with w= h= shortcode attributes. You can restrict playback to only Freedom-loving formats using a shortcode parameter of `freedom=true`. You can autoplay a video by setting a shortcode parameter of `autoplay=true`. You can force a Flash video embed by setting a shortcode parameter of `flashonly=true`. The following are all valid shortcodes:

* `[videopress xyz]` uses your default theme content_width if present, otherwise uses 400px as width.
* `[videopress xyz w=640]` specifies the width of video container to be 640px while preserving the aspect ratio.
* `[videopress xyz w=640 h=360]` specifies both width and height of the video container.
* `[videopress xyz h=300]` specifies the height of the video container to be 300px, while preserving the aspect ratio.
* `[videopress xyz freedom=true]` display videos in only Freedom-loving formats (currently Ogg with Theora video and Vorbis audio).

You will need an account on WordPress.com with the VideoPress upgrade in order to use this plugin. If you don't have already have a WordPress.com account signing up is easy and only takes a few minutes. Visit the "Upgrades" section of wp-admin on your new WordPress.com blog and purchase a [VideoPress upgrade](http://wordpress.com/products/#videopress "VideoPress WordPress.com upgrade").

Video preview elements and HTML5 video are directly inserted into your WordPress post or page, enabling custom styling through CSS or inclusion in your site statistics.

== Installation ==

Installing should be very easy and take fewer than five minutes.

1. Upload `video.zip` into your blog's plugins directory (typically `/wp-content/plugins/`)
2. Unzip the `video.zip` file
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Manage and embed videos on the post edit screen by clicking on the new media icon (looks like a camcorder).
5. Edit blog-level settings such as the Freedom video option through your site's media settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a WordPress.com account to use this plugin? =

Yes.  This plugin relies on a WordPress.com site with the VideoPress premium upgrade to host uploaded videos, transcoded video files, and related information.

= Can I use this plugin to host videos on my own server? =

No.  This plugin requires a WordPress.com blog with the VideoPress upgrade and has no support for hosting videos on your own server.

= My site visitors report playback issues when I set the Freedom playback preference. =

Freedom has its price.

= How can I alter Flash runtime parameters? =

Hook into the `video_flash_params` filter to alter the Flash parameters defined in your page markup. Note: changing `allownetworking` or `allowscriptaccess` values may break your video playback experience. Changing window mode may negatively impact your viewers' playback performance.

= The embedded Flash file hovers above all other page elements regardless of z-index =

Modern versions of the Adobe Flash player separate content into layers handled by specific components of a computer, tablet, or smartphone. This optimization by task allows your viewers to experience smooth video playback using fewer system resources (and battery) than explicit layer controls. See [Abode's Flash embed wmode support by browser](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/127/tn_12701.html#main_Browser_support_for_Window_Mode__wmode__values) for more information.

= My visitors are unable to view some videos when Flash is not installed (such as iPhone) =

Some video publishers restrict video embedding and sharing features. HTML5 video includes a full URI to a video file in the page markup, a feature that causes some concerns among publishers attempting to limit playback locations and video distribution. Restricted embeds are included on the page using Flash markup.
