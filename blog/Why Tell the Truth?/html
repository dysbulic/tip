        <ol>
          <li><em>Homo sapien</em> is happy when he is doing what he is passionate about.</li>
          <li>Why then, does he do things other than what he is passionate about?</li>
          <li>Because he fears something surely. Are his fears reasonable?</li>
          <li>There is a high error term in his guess as to if his fears are reasonable because everyone around him is lying.</li>
          <li>They're lying perhaps to hold a competitive advantage over him, or perhaps because they fear injuring his feelings.</li>
          <li>Regardless of the reason, they widen the variance between reality and the person's perceptions.</li>
          <li>Because of this error in perception, he is incorrect in his reasoning even beyond the limitations of his mental hardware.</li>
          <li>These greater fears drive him away from his passion, and reasonably so since the one thing every link in the 10 million years of evolution behind him managed to do was reproduce.</li>
          <li>There has always been a scarcity of resources.</li>
          <li>There's not now, or at least there doesn't have to be.</li>
          <li>If everyone, tomorrow just wanted to start sharing, we'd end world hunger in two months, right?</li>
          <li>No other animal before humanity was able to assess itself and say, we have enough. They simply continued to compete.</li>
          <li>What separates man from every other animal however is that we self-regulate. We have to, there's nothing predating us.</li>
          <li>The lying though causes jitter in people's ability to predict the future.</li>
          <li>Which makes them fearful, since he is a work of art made to survive.</li>
          <li>Which keeps him from his passion, whatever that passion might be.</li>
          <li>Do you understand this argument? When you help make the world a place where people don't follow their dreams.</li>
          <li>With less lying, people will understand the world them better and can make better decisions &mdash; be happier, you, me, everyone. It doesn't matter what makes you happy, only what fears keep you from pursing it.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>In said e-mail describe the aforementioned argument and follow it with a detailed plan in hopes that the reader will be intrigued enough to continue.</li>
