    <p>The idea that I have been contemplating for a while is the idea of organizing all the information for a site in terms of a graph. The information is drawn from a <a href="../organizing_information/">content graph</a>, pass through <a href="../templating_basics/">templates</a> and end up as content.</p>

    <p>Today I'm working on what the maintenance of a graph looks like. How are nodes created and added? The final model that I want to move toward is:</p>

    <object type="image/svg+xml" data="clouded_graph.svg"></object>

    <!--more-->

    <p>The content graph doesn't live on any particular server, rather the relationships are stored on a <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">cloud</a> and the actual strings are on servers. The cloud application is able to link content graphs from across servers to produce dynamic customized content.</p>

    <p></p>

<!--
    <p>The things I would like to accomplish with this are threefold:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Handle repositioning of information. For example, I write these posts on my computer at home and when I want to move them to another server, lots of links get broken. I'd like the computer to track the structure well enough that information can be repositioned without breaking.</li>
      <li>Allow collaboration at a deeper level while maintaining separation of work. I've been representing these graphs as static elements. In reality, for <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">framework I want to use</a>, the tree never exists. Instead a stream of messages representing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">traversal</a> are generated. This sources for this stream could come from multiple sources based on user preferences.</li>
      <li>Facilitate data sharing. I'm really interested in the idea of increasing cross-organizational productivity by leveraging transparency. This model of a content graph is the simplest data structure that maintains complex contextual relationships and rather than encouraging use by philosophical argument, I think real adoption will only be driven by useful tools.</li>
    </ul>
