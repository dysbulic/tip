It is fortunately also one of the most mature and it has been hardened significantly over its lifetime.

>Chrooting. This is probably the most intensive hardening step that you can take. You will create a special directory structure to house Apache and its modules and then when it runs it will not be able to access files outside of that structure. Even if the server were somehow compromised it will not be able to access anything outside of the structure that you have created. I am not going to cover chrooting in this document because it has already been covered extensively in <A

>Dynamic and interactive content is the way of the future and allowing users to produce it is a good way to allow them to create more interesting and creative work. Also however it allows for a variety of security exploits since your webpages are in essence becoming programs and since your maintenance is remote it is letting people from all over run programs on your computer. There are ways to prevent the affects that these programs can have on your computer however. Chrooting is a major one, even if someone manages to get a malicious script onto your computer it will be restricted to /home/www. The main Apache process is running as root (in order to be able to bind port 80) but it does not serve content or run scripts itself, rather subprocesses are created that run as the apache user, so though root can possibly break out of a chroot jail the apache user (and thus scripts) cannot.</P

        <P
>There are two primary ways that content is generated that I am going to deal with. One is a cgi program (often written in perl, python, or C) that runs and generates content. The other is preprocessed files (like php) where the code is often intermixed with html and the file is interpreted by a server module to generate the content.</P

>CGI programs are the most dangerous programs that you can run. They are usually written in languages that were designed to be powerful but not to be controlled. It is difficult to control the actions of cgi programs and it is a very good idea to restrict access to where they can be run from and people who can alter them as much as possible. In this setup the web root (/home/www/files/html) is on a partition that is mounted <B
CLASS="command"
>noexec</B
> so it is not possible to run cgi programs in the web root. It is a good idea to go ahead and set up Apache as though it were possible though since the mount options might change later and you would not want to be vulnerable.</P

          <P
>There are a couple of apache directives to control how cgi is run. You should place these in the primary Directory directive in etc/httpd.conf:</P
