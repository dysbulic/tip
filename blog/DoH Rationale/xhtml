    <p>The idea of the Department of Happiness is based on idea of getting feedback from users based on weighted descriptors.</p>

    <p>My <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dhappy.habits">habit tracker</a> has a version in the mood collection interface. First, the user is presented with a list of descriptors they've compiled:</p>

    <p>Once they choose a descriptor they can give it a weight:</p>

    <p>These descriptors will vary over time:</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/graph/happiness over time.svg"/>

    <p>I wanted then to collect as complete a digital profile as I could of the user. Then, use both historical trends and patterns from other users to try and extrapolate decisions that would probably increase their self-reported happiness.</p>

    <p>The main focus was setting up the population of events. The computer is trying to group people together and expose them to both situations and substances.</p>

    <p>The computer might recommend a group for a festival and suggest that their experience would be more enjoyable with weed.</p>

    <p>While and after the duration of the event, the participants can give their opinions in the form of weighted tags.</p>

    <p>The band might be <q>Melodic</q> 59% and <q>Energetic</q> 77%. Group member Bob is <q>Cute</q> 60% and <q>Intereating</q> -35%. The user self-reports as <q>Entertained</q> 40% and <q>High</q> 40%.</p>

    <p>The app could prompt the user for particularly salient descriptors.</p>

    <p>From this information the computer builds a model of probable responses to various stimuli.</p>
