This is a listing of the flies that I have. I like music alot and my tastes are pretty varied. Most of my mp3 collection is just my own CD's which I have ripped and encoded. My speakers are better on my computer than on the little clock radio that I have as my only other source of music. =)

First is a list of cd's that I burned while I was at home for my little brother which have the extent of my collection on them at that time.
<br><br>
<a href="./cd_list_01.txt">CD #1</a>, 
<a href="./cd_list_02.txt">CD #2</a>, 
<a href="./cd_list_03.txt">CD #3</a>, 
<a href="./cd_list_04.txt">CD #4</a>, 
<a href="./cd_list_05.txt">CD #5</a>, 
<a href="./cd_list_06.txt">CD #6</a>,

For a better idea here is just a listing from the drive where I have everything stored. <a href="./mp3_list_05_28_99.txt">Listing</a> as of May 28, 1999. <a href="./mp3_list_06_16_99.txt">Listing</a> as of June 16, 1999.
