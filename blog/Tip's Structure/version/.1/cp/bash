/* The string divisor is the first character in the stream. The stream
 * is guaranteed not to contain that character unless it represents a
 * record ( or string ) separation.
 *
 * This represents a maximum limit on the longest non-pathological string.
 * The goal of the intelligence is to generate the longest non-pathological string.
 *
 * Pathology is diagnosed through user feedback. The user is making tags through a
 * namespace which aligns at certain points. The current implementation is a
 * filesystem which aligns with structured datastore Freebase.
 *
 * The namespace I’ve decided to assign in my repository is ࢝, so anywhere a
 * directory/file combo ࢝/mql is found in a traversal, the string at mql
 * will interpret to a freebase object.
 *
 * The return value is merged with the directory contents and the git history.
 * 
 * This structure is navigable by shell programs which can perform arbitrarily
 * complex actions. It is a dynamically programmable semantic computer.
 * 
 * For example, I just created a symlink from ߦ/bin/tohex to ߦ/bin/to/base/16/bash
 * that is a structural logical statement about the operation of the overarching
 * machine.
 *
 * The conglomeration of links involves at least these sources:
   * The the filesystem which is the operating system’s guess as to the most current version of the filesystem
   * A revision system built from a set symlinks necessary to (within the limits
     * of disk space) to dereference:
       * ߦhist/((((?:date ((?:year \d+)-)?((?:month (0*((1[0-2])|(\d{1,2}))))-))?((?:day \d+))){1,}(@))?
         *      ((?:hour \d{1,})(:(?minute: \d+))(:(?:second \d+))(\.(?:millisecond \d+)))
         *      (* ToDo: Another pattern with year, month and day variables
       *           these are addressible as match/2/year/, etc. *))
     * A set of XMPP bots and chatrooms
       * "ߦpub Will Holcomb" as an address in that graph, for example.
     * Freebase Queries ߦmql
       * Or ߦmql/js or ࢝mql/python if the results need to be filtered to a new tree 

 * ToDo: A FUSE driver for Mïmis
   *     Ignores ... in recursive searches
     *     Better yet, ߦproc/traversal/ignore is a null separated list of patterns to avoid
   *     Uses the contents of /proc/sh/path/separator as the path separator
   *     Uses the contents of /proc/࢝/record/separator as the IFS (maybe)
   *       Yeah, you have to be able to specify substrings, so there has to
     *       be a substring separator. You can’t have a hierarcy without at
     *       least two bits to encode ( neighbor, parent, child, root )

 * The trees are merged in reverse order of precedence. A stream is generated from
 * each location with each preceeding operating being given mediated access to the 
 * structure.
 *
 * The main difference between this graph, however and others is that there are
 * two classes of links. Bidirectional and forward only. Moving backward through
 * the tree represents undoing the operation of combining sources in which a
 * specific computational path was followed.
 *
 * So the bidirectional path is the Freebase locations and the forward-only
 * symlinks are a semantic encoding.
 * 
 * Navigating this composite graph is a simple process of aggregating the results
 * of machines outputting subdivided strings. Navigating this machine can be
 * done using the metaphors underlying the shell.
 *
 * This program is copy (࢝bin/cp). Files are either in git, in which case they
 * can be copied without worry, or they are symlinks into ࢝hashes/.+/\d. If the file
 * is a matching symlink then it is renamed to the base name postceded by \.\x{2}
