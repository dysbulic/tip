    <p>We have had enough food to feed everyone in the world since 1968. Why starvation exists is a huge problem involving reams of data. To deal with it, we need an accurate publicly-accessible computer model of the supply-side of the system.</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/chart/technoanarchy/"/>

    <p>Currently, businesses protect access to inventory and cost information for compeitive gain.</p>

    <p>It makes rudimentary sense that a company operating without net profit should be able to undercut competition in an equitable market.</p>

    <object height="300px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/chart/data silos/"/>

    <p>This can be solved by simply publishing the data and conglomerating it.</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/chart/transparent chain/"/>

    <p>I want to start with a restaurant and focus on the food supply chain â€” build a computer model of where all the food is and figure out how to end starvation.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>I am looking for developers to help with building the software to operate a restarant transparently. I want to use CouchDB to share the data. Essentially it is one huge pool of uniquely identified JSON objects that can be shared between stores without risk of conflict.</p>

    <p>To make the interface to the data more palatable I want to develop the application in Ember. There are a few parts that need to be developed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/costs">Cost Management</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/sales">Point of Sale</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/labor">Scheduling</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are or know Ember developers, I have bitcoins available to drive this project forward.</p>
