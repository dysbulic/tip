  <h1>Sequence Playing Rules</h1>
  <h3>There are 2,4,6 or players.</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Two teams are formed. Players are seated alternately around the playing table.</li>
    <li>Each person is given a stack of poker chips in the team color. White chips are given to the team as they make a "Sequence".</li>
    <li>The object of the game is to place a poker chip of your team’s color in five consecutive spaces, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.</li>
    <li>Two poker decks are shuffled by the dealer, who deals out five cards to each player, one at a time around the table. Two approximately equal decks are placed face up on the playing table to form the draw piles.</li>
    <li>The player to the left of the dealer plays first, placing one chip on the playing board that is identical to the card he wishes to play. These cards are placed face up in front of the player to form a discard pile. The players then draws from the draw deck to replace the card that was played. If he forgets to draw he will be required to wait until his next turn to draw cards in sufficient numbers to fill his hand to the allowed five cards.</li>
    <li>When it is your turn, your must play your card first and then draw to fill your hand to five cards.</li>
    <li>Players try to assist their partners attempts to achieve a Sequence or to block the opponents’ attempts. There is to be no discussion between players.</li>
    <li>The player who achieves a Sequence must say "Sequence" and point to the five consecutive similar colored chips.</li>
    <li>The game is won when a team achieves two Sequences.</li>
    <li>You can use one card in a Sequence to make a second Sequence. This may include a joker.</li>
    <li>If a player has a card that can not be played on the board ("dead card") in his hand, he may discard it and draw another card when it is his turn.</li>
  </ol>
