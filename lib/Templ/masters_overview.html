    <h1>Masters Thesis Overview</h1>
    <h2>Will Holcomb</h2>
    <h2>October 2008</h2>

    <p>The web is growing by leaps and bounds. One of the primary forces driving this expansion is the advent of mainstream participation in content generation. This new medium for communication is fundamentally altering the ways that people operate in the world. Millions of people keep up with our friends, conduct businesses and find mates through channels that didn't exist thirty years ago.</p>

    <p>The largest growth to date has been sites enabling sharing of offline-generated content. YouTube is a well-known example of this phenomenon, but there are thousands of companies whose sole purpose is to stake out some little chunk of the nearly exponential growth in attention devoted to the internet.</p>

    <p>One very popular but still technologically young aspect of this developing market are sites which not only allow users to add content, but to edit it as well. Wikipedia has almost single-handedly lifted the reputation of internet citations up from rumors to a reputable source of information; however, Wikipedia has room to improve. Media Wiki, the open source software that powers Wikipedia, only encodes display criteria, such as the headings and bulleted lists. Specifically, taxonomic metadata explicitly defining the categories for the information is not present at all.</p>

    <p>The semantic web holds the promise of tools that could remove hours of drudgery and error from the average person's life. Combined with the increasing complexity of handheld and other ubiquitous computing devices, an open semantic web could create an amazingly rich daily experience. Imagine getting the menus and reviews for each restaurant you walk by. Or, imagine, as a researcher, that you know with 99% probability that you've read every important paper on whatever you most recent experiment is.</p>

    <p>Why hasn't this idea spread more quickly? The most obvious answer is the lack of tools. Freely available tools for the creation of programs that coherently manipulate categorical semantic data simply don't exist.</p>

    <p>Interesting applications that will drive interest in the semantic web will not draw sufficient developer attention until data is available to power them. Without the applications though, there is little impetus to develop the tools. It is very much a chicken and the egg problem, and one that warrants examination.</p>

    <p>Consider Wikipedia. Because they hard code the display semantics, the designers removed a level of granularity from the representation of the data. If a scientific name and the title of a book are both present in a page, Wikipedia is not able to programatically differentiate between them. They are both simply italicized words. This means that a designer can't have all the book titles in red, or underlined, or present in some special index that lists all the books in a particular section. The information isn't encoded in the document.</p>
    
    <p>They can write special code to try and guess which italicized words are titles of books, but it will be a non-trivial undertaking. With a system that allowed the sufficiently simple manipulation of semantic data, however, that flexibility is much simpler and much more easily generalizable. Changing from an index of all the books to an index of all the American Presidents is the difference in the parameter to a function rather than a whole new piece of code.</p>

    <p>My interest, as a Master's thesis, is to assume that the semantic web has actual information theoretic reasons that one can build interesting systems using it. I will further assume that the current lack of adoption then is a function of a lack of proper tools as opposed to some fundamental flaw in the design. The research question then is why have previous tools failed and what are the specific characteristics of modern languages that have caused them to fail.</p>

    <p>Certainly everyone knows a programmer who absolutely loves Haskell or LISP, but despite those pockets of interest, neither of these languages has seen widespread adoption. What are the characteristics of popular languages that have been missing from the tools for developing applications for the semantic web? How can tools be designed with that should theoretically be more popular?</p>

    <p>The thesis itself then would be the design and implementation of a content management system that proposes solutions to these issues. Specifically, I am interested in the application of templating languages with functional (as opposed to procedural) idioms. There are some interesting technologies in the transformations of event pipelines that offer the possibility of very powerful but resource-light implementations.</p>
