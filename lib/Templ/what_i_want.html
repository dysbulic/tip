    <h1>What I Want in PHP Templating</h1>

    <h2>Real Versioning</h2>

    <p>Currently my sites live in <a href="http://svn.himinbi.org">subversion</a>. I can look at the state of the site at any point in the past. Most of the systems I have looked at have a review option to where a moderator can view and approve changes before they go live. I would like to have that, but also real versioning.</p>

    <p>That said, there needs to be a convenient method to connect to information not in the repository. For example, all of the images in my site are linked to from a copy of <a href="http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/">gallery</a>. Having everything in subversion means there is an additional copy of the file in the repository. For text this is not an issue, for 10gb of movies, versioing doesn't add anything and it is a waste of space.</p>

    <p>The other thing I get from subversion is the ability to work on everything from work, home and on the server seamlessly. If I want to work on it somewhere else or let someone else work on it, they just check out a copy and work on it.</p>

    <h2>Real Editors</h2>

    <p>I do the majority of my work in emacs. It validates my XML, it colorizes my code and the ability to replace regular expressions can be incredibly useful. I like being able to run my files through xmllint. There are lots of different files that operate on files and when your only access to your content is through a webpage, you loose that.</p>

    <h2>XML Control Structures</h2>

    <p>One of the idioms I dislike in PHP is specifying something like:</p>

    <pre>&lt;?php if(isLoggedIn()) { ?&gt;
blah, blah, blah, three pages of html
&lt;?php } ?&gt;</pre>

    <p>For certain control structures I prefer the XSLT structure:</p>

    <pre>&lt;xslt:if test="isLoggedIn()"&gt;
  blah, blah, blah
&lt;/xslt:if&gt;</pre>

    <p>Both of these will validate as XML, but the validation of the second verifies the nesting of the control structure. It saves the wandering through pages of code trying to find the missing brace.</p>

    <h2>Unified Templates</h2>

    <p>One of the things I really don't like about Smarty, which is the dominant templating engine, is that if I would like a unified look and feel on my site, I do a template like this to unify the appearance:</p>

    <pre>&lt;?php include('header.inc') ?>
blah blah page content
&lt;?php include('footer.inc') ?></pre>

    <p>Where the <code>html</code> tag opens in the header and closes in the footer. I want something that lets me build up a page from components, but while keeping the tags that open and close in a single file.</p>

    <h2>Non-XML Control Structures</h2>

    <p>There are a few times though that the nesting constructs are problematic though. Take for instance inserting SVGs into documents. The standards compliant way to do this is:</p>

    <pre>&lt;object style="width: 50%; height: 200px; margin: auto;" type="image/svg+xml" data="img.svg">
  &lt;img src="img.png" alt="image" />
&lt;/object></pre>

    <p>According to the object tag specification, the &lt;img> tag is ignored when the browser recognizes the type of the &lt;object>. The problem is IE6 doesn't implement this and will display both. This can either be handled in the HTML with conditional content or cut it in the template:</p>

    <pre>&lt;php if(!$isIE) print '&lt;object &hellip;>\n' ?>
  &lt;img src="img.png" alt="image" />
&lt;php if(!$isIE) print '&lt;/object>\n' ?></pre>

    <p>I'm trying to come up with other examples, but the gist is there are times that the nested syntax is inappropriate.</p>

    <h2>Entity Replacement in Text</h2>

    <p>Something that PHP doesn't do that would be nice is the ability to insert non-escaped text into entites. Rather than:</p>

    <pre>&lt;img class="&lt;?php print $className ?>" &hellip; /></pre>

    <p>I would like to be able to do:</p>

    <pre>&lt;img class="$className" &hellip; /></pre>

    <p>XSLT does that and it lets you make much less convoluted structures that will validate as XML. I can't think of a time that I have used a dollar sign in an atttribute value. I don't even think it's legal.</p>

    <p>I would like for all the files in my templating system to be valid XML. As such, it is trivial to discern attribute values from other text.</p>

    <p>Something else I was thining was you could trigger the behavior by having a certain namespace included with the document. So if the node had <code>xmlns:repl="http://templ.madstones.com/repl"</code> then you could do the replacements. Furthermore you could include arguments like <code>xmlns:repl="http://templ.madstones.com/repl?processparas"</code> if you wanted to also include the content of paragraph tags. (<em>I'll have to think on this more to decide how much I like that idea.</em>)</p>

    <h2>XSLT Pipelining</h2>

    <p>The last thing I am interested in is the ability to include information from disperate sources through a common interface. Something along the lines of cocoon. The thing about cocoon is it applies XSLT transformations to a SAX event stream. PHP's XSLT engine is DOM based and I don't really want to create a 2gb in memory tree to process.</p>
