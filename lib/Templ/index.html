    <h1>Templ Templating Engine and <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym></h1>

    <p>2007/04/17 &mdash; I'm currently <a href="http://mpp.org">MPP</a>'s web administrator. I get lots of requests for <a href="http://mpp.org/campaigns">campaign sites</a> that need to go up quickly. I'm very comfortable with HTML and CSS. I don't need or want a WYSIWYG editor. I write in emacs, and with things like regex matching and learn scripts, I work more quickly without the web prettiness. Once I've done a design though, I definitely don't want to be responsible for the myriad content edits that have to be subsequently done, nor do I expect anyone else to learn or enjoy the tools I use.</p>

    <p>I know there are 800 <a href="http://www.opensourcecms.com">different CMSes</a> and probably 200 different templating systems. I've tried several of them and I don't really love any of them. I've thought about <a href="what_i_want.html">things I want</a> and most of the popular CMSes are stronger on the CMS interface rather than the templating language. My interest is a system that allows me as a knowledgeable devloper to quickly produce sites. The later content edits by less technical people are important, but I want the system to be powerful first and then build tools that novice users need on top of that.</p>

    <p>The Templ engine uses a two-stage generation process &mdash; a modular java-based system which compiles templates to HTML, SVG, PHP, etc. The reasons for this are varied:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For many sites there are processing operations on the data that are complex, but which only need to be done once. Having a part of the system that is run when content changes increases efficiency for certain dynamic sites.</li>
      <li>Java servlets are memory intensive and servlets containers are not widely available on cheap hosting plans, so an all-java solution is not practical.</li>
      <li>PHP is a fine language for small projects, but even with its increasing focus on object orieted design, it can be <a href="http://tnx.nl/php">cumbersome</a> for large projects.</li>
      <li>Java virtual machines and PHP are common on hosting plans, so java's power can be leveraged without requiring a servlet container.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The basic idea is that a layout template is shared across a site. The different areas of the page come from an environmental context. This context is provided from a variety of sources. Currently for each output page there is an associated file that contains environment information (title, content, etc.)</p>

    <p><a href="build/api/">HooksProcessor</a> starts at some base directory and iterates over all the files in that directory running a set of transforms on them to produce the output documents. The <a href="default_settings.html">default settings</a> are discussed in <a href="default_settings.html">another document</a>.</p>

    <p>As work is progressing, I will need to contemplate a variety of problems. I do my thinking by writing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="file_access.html">File access</a></li>
      <li><a href="listings.html">Listings</a></li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>To try out my ideas, I am doing a <a href="ctc_migration/">test migration</a>. I figure I'll design the templates like I would like them to work and then I'll write the software to make them actually produce something.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://ssl." : "http://www.");
      document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + gaJsHost + "google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      try {
        var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker("UA-2592249-7");
        pageTracker._trackPageview();
      } catch(err) {}
    </script>
