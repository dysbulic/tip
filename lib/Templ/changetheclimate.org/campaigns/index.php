  the Climate was founded by parents and business professionals to educate the 
  public about the tremendous waste of our tax dollars for the &quot;war on marijuana&quot; 
  and the increasing threat to our basic civil liberties. Our goal is to tell 
  the truth about marijuana -- to de-demonize it -- so that someday, politicians 
  will support marijuana reform legislation. We do this through provocative print 
  advertising in major U.S. cities around the country. Here you can read up on 
  our past and upcoming ad campaigns.</font></p>
