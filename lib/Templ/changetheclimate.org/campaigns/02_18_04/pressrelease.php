<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial"><b><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><img src="/images/behindbars.jpg" alt="Marijuana laws waste billions of taxpayer dollars to lock up non-violent americans." width="300" height="207" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right"></font></b></font><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Change 
  the Climate is an organization of parents and business executives who believe 
  that current marijuana laws are harmful to our children and far too expensive 
  in this time of local cutbacks and out-of-control deficits. </font></P>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Marijuana policy ads by Change 
  the Climate seek to stimulate debate among citizens about how to reconsider 
  marijuana laws so that we save billions of tax dollars and end the arrest of 
  millions of our own children - arrests that result from something most politicians 
  did when they were young.</font></P>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Surveys show that vast majorities 
  of Americans support the medical use of marijuana for sick family members and 
  for using our criminal justice system for real criminals. Citizens want to speak 
  up and debate our current marijuana laws.</font></P>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">The Federal government&#8217;s 
  response to open debate is censorship. The Office of National of Drug Control 
  Policy and the Partnership for a Drug Free America&#8217;s ads have done little 
  to reduce marijuana experimentation by our youth. In fact, government ads that 
  associate marijuana use with terrorism and teen pregnancy are so far-fetched 
  that teens are either amused or insulted. It is time that we talk honestly with 
  kids about marijuana.</font></P>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Representative Istook&#8217;s backdoor 
  amendment proves that the Congress is willing to violate the Constitution in 
  order to hide from citizens the most basic facts about the impact of our current 
  drug laws. Government censorship to quell criticism of its own policies should 
  not be tolerated in the United States.</font></P>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial"> If politicians really want to 
  reduce marijuana use by young people they would regulate and control it like 
  alcohol and tobacco, instead of making it easily available on the mean streets 
  of America.</font></P>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial"> Preventing the free exchange of 
  ideas on marijuana is un-American. It is time we consider new ways of thinking 
  about marijuana issues by having an honest dialogue instead of continuing ineffective 
  and wasteful government policies.</font></P>
