  of all, we believe that sex and marijuana use exist completely in the private 
  realm of consenting and responsible adults. We realize, unfortunately, that 
  many politicians see the bedroom and other private, individual activities as 
  important areas for government legislation. <b>We want to stress that sex and 
  marijuana are for adults - or at least for individuals who have achieved a level 
  of emotional &amp; psychological maturity that is reflected in a balanced, productive 
  life.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">It is in the spirit of 
  fostering debate about whether politicians should be &quot;legislating their 
  opinion of morality&quot; that we chose to use the &quot;Enjoy Better Sex&quot; 
  ad as part of our campaign. Given the deafening hysteria by conservatives about 
  gay marriage and homosexual sex - not to mention marijuana use - we could not 
  resist incorporating marijuana and sexuality in our Washington DC campaign. 
  With 50 buses and 40 bus shelters displaying this ad around the capitol, we 
  expect to further raise the hackles of America's &quot;morality police.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Government prohibition 
  policies prevent research into the medical benefits of marijuana, including 
  positive connections between marijuana and sex.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Marijuana has been used 
  in one form or another across many different cultures as an<br>
  aphrodisiac for thousands of years. Marijuana has been used in India for at 
  least 3,000 years to increase libido and conquer impotence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Clearly, marijuana use 
  during sex varies depending on the individual and intoxication levels. For example, 
  some people report an increase in tactile sensation, visual stimulation, and 
  fantasy production. While others report that marijuana decreased their interest 
  in sex, especially when the marijuana high overwhelmed the sexual experience.</font><br>
