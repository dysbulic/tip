<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><img src="../../images/kids-ad-03dc.jpg" width="406" height="163" align="right" alt="Protect our children!  Legalize and Tax Marijuana.">Government 
  funded studies show that over 50% of high school students will experiment with 
  marijuana. Many parents who talk to their kids about marijuana know that it 
  is very easy for them to obtain, much easier than alcohol - a drug regulated 
  by the government. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">If your child is likely 
  to experiment with marijuana - partly because it is a teenage thing to do and 
  partly because it is so easy to obtain, then shouldn't we consider ways to make 
  it more difficult for kids to get marijuana? One of these ways is to regulate 
  marijuana, taking it out of the black market and off the streets. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">If kids had to go to 
  a state-sanctioned store and show an ID, it might make it more difficult than 
  going down to the corner or to the rough section of town to buy some marijuana. 
  This is a common sense approach to limit easy access to marijuana by underage 
  children. If we care about our kids, this strategy should be on the table for 
  discussion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Parents want to protect 
  our kids and keep them safe. Government policies on marijuana put our kids at 
  greater risk and here's why - since there is a good chance your child will experiment 
  with marijuana, they will have to find it somewhere. The undeniable result of 
  current prohibitionist policies is that marijuana will often be available from 
  the same people who sell harder, more dangerous drugs like crack cocaine, heroin, 
  speed and PCP, just to name a few. Therefore, government restrictions on marijuana 
  put our children at much greater risk by pushing them to dangerous places with 
  dangerous people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Over 700,000 people are 
  arrested each year for marijuana possession, including many of our own children. 
  When a child is arrested they are taken to the police station holding cell while 
  the arresting officer processes the arrest. If the holding area is crowded, 
  your child could be taken to the local jail during processing. Guess what? Jails 
  are very dangerous places for kids. Would you want your child in jail for a 
  minor marijuana infraction for any reason? Again, our government's punitive 
  policies on marijuana put young people in greater danger than using marijuana 
  itself. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">If government leaders 
  are so concerned about children, why would they let such a widely used intoxicant 
  (marijuana) be potentially subjected to alteration with dangerous substances? 
  If the government regulated and controlled marijuana, it could ensure the safety 
  and uniformity of the product just like they do for other food and drugs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Finally, the Higher Education 
  Act passed several years ago by Congress ensures that your child will not be 
  eligible for federal student loans if he/she is convicted of any marijuana offense, 
  no matter how small. Of course this counterproductive law falls most harshly 
  on low-income families who cannot afford good lawyers and whose children need 
  federal loans and a college education to raise their chances for a successful 
  life.</font><br>
