  OF JOSEPH WHITE</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Now comes Joseph White 
  who states as follows subject to the pains and penalties of perjury. </font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> My name is Joseph 
    White. I am married, with three children, and live in Greenfield, Massachusetts. 
    I am currently employed as Senior Vice President of The Share Group, a company 
    that offers consulting, fund-raising and marketing services to nonprofit organizations 
    and socially responsible businesses. I am also the Executive Director and 
    founder of the plaintiff, Change The Climate, Inc., an organization I founded 
    separately from my job with The Share Group. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> I founded Change 
    the Climate in 1999 as a concerned parent and citizen, with the support of 
    my family and friends, for the purpose of raising public awareness about marijuana 
    issues, including the potential harm to our children resulting from arrest 
    and incarceration and the inordinate amount of tax dollars spent on marijuana 
    law enforcement. Like President Jimmy Carter expressed over twenty years ago, 
    I too am concerned that the penalties against possession of marijuana should 
    not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself. My 
    intention in founding Change the Climate has always been, and continues to 
    be, quite literally, to &quot;change the climate&quot; around the discussion 
    of marijuana policies in our country by broadening the terms of the debate. 
    I believe that in order to change the terms of the debate, accurate information 
    about marijuana needs to be presented and discussed in a public forum. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Change the Climate's 
    mission is to stimulate debate about marijuana issues, including, among other 
    concerns, the negative consequences of our marijuana laws on our children, 
    the differences between marijuana and other drugs such as heroin and cocaine, 
    the extraordinary resources our government has devoted to marijuana law enforcement, 
    and the proven beneficial medical (1999 Institute of Medicine Report) and 
    industrial uses of marijuana. By encouraging and engaging in public debate, 
    Change the Climate hopes to reduce the level of hysteria and misinformation 
    about marijuana that has so long dominated the public domain.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Towards that end, 
    I have created and operate a web site at, www. changetheclimate.org, which 
    also operates under the internet domain name changetheclimate.com. I created 
    Change the Climate's web site to be an educational one, where citizens can 
    access accurate information about marijuana. I have included a variety of 
    articles and resources, including the government's own website called The 
    Anti-Drug, that address various aspects of marijuana policy - hemp policies, 
    youth issues, a bulletin board to encourage discussion, scientific studies 
    and the like. Attached hereto is a true and accurate copy of the home page 
    of changetheclimate.org, which welcomes readers to join in the effort to &quot;change 
    the climate&quot; around marijuana issues. (See Tab 1.) <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Through provocative 
    advertising in its media campaign, Change the Climate hopes to raise ideas 
    and questions in peoples' minds about the efficacy of our current marijuana 
    laws and policies. In no way does Change the Climate advocate the use of marijuana 
    or any violation of existing laws. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Woven throughout 
    Change the Climate's promotional materials, the interactive web site, and 
    the national advertising campaign are Change the Climate's explicit messages, 
    and my personal belief, that the truth need be spoken about marijuana and 
    that marijuana is not for kids. These messages are stated clearly on the Home 
    Page of our website, for example. (See Tab 1.) As a parent, I'm concerned 
    about how we - as adults and as a government - communicate to kids about marijuana 
    and other drugs. After spending billions upon billions of tax dollars, we 
    have made little progress in keeping drugs away from our children. Change 
    the Climate's goal is to foster debate to generate new ways of thinking that 
    will make it more difficult for children to have access to drugs, which are 
    more accessible than controlled legal substances like alcohol and tobacco. 
    <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> In assembling the 
    material I have placed on Change the Climate's web site, I have drawn from 
    many sources. In particular, I have relied heavily on the expert advice of 
    The Lindesmith Center West, (&quot;Lindesmith Center&quot;), a drug policy 
    institute in San Francisco, California, and received assistance from Marsha 
    Rosenbaum, Ph.D., the Director of the Lindesmith Center, who is recognized 
    as a leading authority on drug and adolescent issues. In my effort to keep 
    current on these issues, most recently, I attended The Lindesmith/Drug Policy 
    Foundation conference &quot;Drug Policies for the New Millennium,&quot; held 
    from May 30 to June 2, 2001, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Over 800 professionals 
    took part in the conference, including New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson and 
    Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California. Among the conference speakers was 
    Rodney Skager, a PhD in Psychology and Professor Emeritus of the Graduate 
    School of Education and Information Studies at U.C.L.A. After talking with 
    Professor Skager at the conference, he was kind enough to forward me a copy 
    of the text of a speech he delivered at the 2nd International Conference on 
    Drugs &amp; Young People in Melbourne, Australia in April of this year, that 
    I am thinking of posting on Change the Climate's web site with his permission. 
    A true and accurate copy of Professor Skager's speech is attached hereto. 
    (See Tab 2.) <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Change the Climate's 
    goal is to make as much information as accessible to the public as possible, 
    especially since the hysteria around drugs has taken sentencing discretion 
    away from judges through mandatory minimum sentencing, filled our prisons 
    with non-violent drug offenders, and prevented meaningful dialogue on marijuana 
    issues. While various people in the legal community have spoken on these issues, 
    (for a sampling of some courageous judges who have become vocal on the consequences 
    of the drug war on the administration of justice, see the Voluntary Committee 
    of Lawyers web site at www.vcl.org/Judges/Judges_speak), I believe that most 
    average Americans are fearful to engage in these discussions in the current 
    political climate, and so our advertising campaigns seek to open discussion 
    and debate among parents, children and other concerned citizens. Dr. Rosenbaum 
    agrees, and has generously authorized Change the Climate to quote liberally 
    from her publications on our web site. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> One section of Change 
    the Climate's web site is devoted to the subject of kids and marijuana. Borrowing 
    heavily from Dr. Rosenbaum's publications on the subject, this section suggests 
    that in order to curb marijuana use by young people, adults need to first 
    regain credibility with them by providing honest information about drugs. 
    The reader is directed to Dr. Rosenbaum's articles, including &quot;Just Say 
    Know&quot; to Teenagers and Marijuana, that have appeared in professional 
    journals such as the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, Vol. 30 (2), April-June 
    1998 and national newspapers such as The San Francisco Chronicle. While Change 
    the Climate agrees that ideally children should abstain from using all drugs 
    (whether it be cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana or hard drugs), it is well documented 
    that despite repeated exposure to such &quot;zero tolerance&quot; messages 
    in our schools, our trains and buses, and on billboards, the abstinence message 
    has fallen on deaf ears. See, e.g., Donald R. Lynam, Richard Milich, et.al., 
    Project DARE: No Effects at 10-year Follow Up, Journal of Consulting and Clinical 
    Psychology, Vol. 67 (4), pp. 590-93 (August 1999) (documenting &quot;the absence 
    of beneficial effects associated with the DARE program,&quot; which was true 
    regarding attitudes toward drug use as well as actual drug use); S.T. Ennett, 
    et.al., How Effective is Drug Abuse Resistance Education? A Meta-Analysis 
    of Project DARE Outcome Evaluations, American Journal of Public Health, Vol. 
    84, pp. 1394-1401 (1994) (analyzing the results of a federally funded Research 
    Triangle Institute study of DARE that found the program's &quot;core curriculum 
    effect on drug use relative to whatever drug education (if any) was offered 
    in the control schools is slight and, except for tobacco use, not statistically 
    significant.&quot;); Office of Applied Studies, National Institute on Drug 
    Abuse, National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: Main Finding 1998, p. 174 
    (SAMSHA, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services March 2000) (documenting 
    results of federal research showing that the Office of National Drug Control 
    Policy's anti-drug media campaign is ineffective); Dr. Dennis Rosenbaum, Assessing 
    the Effects of School-based Drug Education: A Six Year Multilevel Analysis 
    of Project DARE, Abstract, April 6, 1998 (finding after a six year study of 
    1,798 students that &quot;DARE had no long-term effects on a wide range of 
    drug use measures,&quot; that DARE does not &quot;prevent drug use at the 
    stage in adolescent development when drugs become available and widely used, 
    namely during the high school years,&quot; and that &quot;DARE may actually 
    be counterproductive.&quot;); L. Johnston, J. Bachman &amp; P. O'Malley, Monitoring 
    the Future: National Results on Adolescent Drug Use Overview of Key Findings 
    1999, p. 48, Table 6 (NIDA 2000) (documenting that from 1975 to 1998, &quot;at 
    least 82% of high school seniors surveyed said they find marijuana fairly 
    easy or very easy to obtain,&quot; and in 1999, &quot;88.9% of high school 
    seniors said it was fairly or very easy to obtain.&quot;). Study after study 
    shows that kids walk away from such non-informational messages cynical and 
    distrustful of adults, their intelligence insulted, discounting both the message 
    and the messenger. Like Dr. Rosenbaum, Change the Climate wants education 
    and public discussion to succeed where so many grossly simplistic slogans 
    (&quot;Just Say No&quot;) and ludicrous scare tactics (&quot;This is your 
    brain on drugs&quot;) have failed. The reality is that kids experiment with 
    drugs. This is why Change the Climate elevates the practical goal of keeping 
    our kids safe from hard drugs by empowering them with the knowledge to make 
    informed decisions over the unrealistic goal of abstention. <br>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Another section of 
    Change the Climate's web site is devoted to debunking common myths regarding 
    marijuana by providing well documented facts. The information included in 
    this section of the web site was taken from the critically acclaimed publication, 
    Marijuana Myths, Marijuana Facts, by Drs. Lynn Zimmer and John P. Morgan, 
    with permission. Change the Climate invites readers to learn more about this 
    publication by visiting The Lindesmith Center web site, which is hyperlinked 
    to Change the Climate's site, so that they may do so with the click of a button. 
    True and accurate copies of the pages in this section of the web site are 
    attached hereto. (See Tab 3.) <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Another section of 
    the web site provides information on Change the Climate's national advertising 
    campaign, including information and articles on the legal battles we have 
    been forced to wage. Change the Climate attempted its first campaign in Boston, 
    MA, but the campaign was thwarted in January of 2000, after advertisements 
    submitted to the MBTA were rejected by Lucy Shorter because of her perception 
    that Change the Climate &quot;promotes the use of marijuana in a suttle [sic] 
    way and also is really a reform marijuana in a [sic] effort to legalize&quot;, 
    and that &quot;the T's appearance &amp; character policy and drug &amp; alcohol 
    policy&quot; were &quot;in conflict with [Change the Climate's] mission.&quot; 
    <br>
    <br>
    After suit was filed in this case, the Cellucci administration's support for 
    the MBTA's conduct, and against Change the Climate's right to engage in political 
    speech, was widely reported in the news. True and accurate copies of a Boston 
    Herald article, &quot;Gov. Sticks by Pot Ad Fight - Forbids MBTA To Settle,&quot; 
    and an editorial, &quot;Cellucci just says no: A Boston Herald editorial&quot; 
    that expressed &quot;kudos&quot; to then Governor Cellucci for his &quot;gutsy&quot; 
    support of the MBTA's decision to &quot;just say no&quot; to Change the Climate's 
    &quot;nonsense,&quot; are attached hereto. A true and accurate copy of my 
    letter to the editor, pointing out the articles' misquotations of Change the 
    Climate's advertising campaign, is also attached (all three are accessible 
    on Change the Climate's web site). (See Tab 5.) <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> The second campaign 
    that Change the Climate attempted was in Washington, D.C. Initially, the Washington 
    Metro Transit Authority (&quot;the Metro&quot;) rejected Change the Climate's 
    proposed advertisements based on a policy that purported to restrict public 
    advertisements to those &quot;not designed to influence legislation or public 
    opinion on a controversial subject.&quot; After Change the Climate retained 
    the American Civil Liberties Union and the law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter, 
    who threatened suit on Change the Climate's behalf, the Metro relented and 
    agreed to post 560 ads on marijuana issues. Change the Climate ultimately 
    paid a discounted advertising rate to the Metro in exchange for illuminated 
    signs on 10 subway platforms, large exterior signs for 50 buses and smaller 
    signs for the interiors of an additional 500 buses. The month-long campaign 
    consisted of three ads. The first, which was displayed in the Metro stations 
    - including the one closest to the White House - features a young woman with 
    the text, &quot;Why do kids go to jail for doing what politicians did when 
    they were young? Tell us the truth.&quot; The second ad, displayed inside 
    buses, features a business executive with the text: &quot;I've got cancer. 
    I smoke pot after chemotherapy. It's my choice, right? Wrong.&quot; The third, 
    which appeared on the outside of Metro buses, is the same advertisement that 
    is the subject of the present law suit, featuring two police officers standing 
    in front of an American flag with the text: &quot;Police are too important 
    . . . too valuable . . . too good . . . to waste on arresting people for marijuana 
    when real criminals are on the loose.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    oftlineAccording to the Metro's advertising guidelines, all public service 
    ads were required to carry a disclaimer that Metro does not endorse the message. 
    A true and accurate copy of a page from the web site concerning our D.C. ad 
    campaign - which includes a photograph of one of the same ads that is the 
    subject of this lawsuit displayed on a DC Transit Metro Bus in January 2001- 
    is attached. (See Tab 6.) The Metro bus in that particular photograph was 
    one of 50 buses with a Change the Climate ad that ran as part of the first 
    ad campaign. To my personal knowledge, there has not been a single reported 
    act of lawlessness connected with Change the Climate's advertisements in Washington 
    D.C. Nor am I aware of any study or other evidence that children or adults 
    are reported to have used marijuana as a result of the advertising campaign.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> In light of the positive 
    responses we received on the D.C. campaign, Change the Climate launched a 
    second campaign in our nation's capitol. Throughout the month of May, an ad 
    ran on 36 bus shelters that has the following text with no pictures: &quot;America 
    1992 to 1999. 4.3 million tobacco deaths. 2.3 million alcohol deaths. 0 marijuana 
    deaths. Tell us the truth . . .&quot; A true and accurate photograph of the 
    ad that was run is attached hereto. (See Tab 7.) To my personal knowledge, 
    there has not been a single reported act of lawlessness connected with the 
    posting of that advertisement either.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> In addition to the 
    two successful campaigns in Washington, D.C., Change the Climate is currently 
    working on transit advertising campaigns in New York City, Chicago, and San 
    Francisco. Change the Climate received requests for assistance with advertising 
    campaigns in Indianapolis, IN, Portland, OR and other locations. With each 
    successful campaign, Change the Climate hopes to gain the momentum necessary 
    to accomplish its goal of generating millions of advertising impressions in 
    as many cities throughout the nation as possible. </font></li>
