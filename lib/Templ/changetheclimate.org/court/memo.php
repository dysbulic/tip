  OF <br>
  PLAINTIFF CHANGE THE CLIMATE, INC.'S<br>
  MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</b></font><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> 
  </font> 
</center>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>I. INTRODUCTION.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Our nation has been 
  engaged in a&quot;war on drugs&quot; since at least the mid-1970's. As with 
  other wars, there is confusion over the purpose as well as disagreement over 
  tactics. In war we tend, in the heat of battle, to lose sight of rationality 
  and the continued need to search for the truth. So the time has come when we 
  must step back from the trenches to determine where we are, what we have accomplished, 
  and where we want to go. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Are these the words 
  of a crazed subversive? A direct incitement to imminent lawless action? An exhortation 
  to our youth to smoke marijuana? Hardly.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">These words, by then 
  Chief Judge of the First Circuit Court of Appeals, provide the political backdrop 
  to this case. These words echo the message of Change the Climate, Inc, the plaintiff 
  in this case, and the cries of countless distinguished jurists, health care 
  professionals, economists, scientists, governors, mayors, prosecutors, former 
  secretaries of state, former U.S. Presidents, political commentators, journalists, 
  police officers, and &quot;average Joes&quot; like Joe White, the founder and 
  Executive Director of plaintiff Change the Climate, who want to see the terms 
  of the debate on our nation's drug policies change, who are frustrated by the 
  hysteria that has so dominated the public domain over the past thirty years, 
  and who have spoken provocatively in an attempt to foster rational, informed 
  public debate on the issues.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Joe White, like Judge 
  Torruella and countless others, recognizes the vastness of the topic, the complexity 
  of the issues. He does not profess to have all the answers, but believes passionately 
  that questions need to be asked and debated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Try as the defendants 
  might, this case is not about promoting the legalization of marijuana. Nor is 
  it about promoting marijuana use by children, a ludicrous interpretation of 
  Change the Climate's express mission and its advertisements. This case is about 
  the right of Change the Climate to advertise its political message on space 
  the MBTA makes available to everybody willing to pay for it, where it is undisputed 
  that other advertisements advocating viewpoints about social, political, religious, 
  and other public interest issues - including advertisements advocating messages 
  that parents talk with their kids about drugs - have been and continue to be 
  on display in MBTA facilities and on MBTA buses and trains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The MBTA's treatment 
  of Change the Climate is but one chapter in a long history of the MBTA's viewpoint-based, 
  unconstitutional censorship of protected speech on matters of important public 
  concern. See, e.g., AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts v. MBTA, 42 F.3d 
  1, 38-40 (1st Cir. 1994) (enjoining unconstitutionally vague advertising policy 
  and viewpoint discrimination in MBTA's rejection of ads urging use of condoms 
  to prevents AIDS), affirming and modifying 849 F. Supp. 79 (D. Mass. 1993) (attached 
  as Exhibit 1a); Citizens to End Animal Suffering and Exploitation v. MBTA, C.A. 
  No. 92-11118-MA (D. Mass. June 5, 1992) (ordering MBTA to post animal rights 
  advertising placard) (attached as Exhibit 1b); Preterm, Inc. v. MBTA, C.A. No. 
  74-159-M,1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8555, at * 6 (D. Mass. May 13, 1974) (granting 
  preliminary injunction ordering display of ads concerning abortion services 
  available at clinic) (attached as Exhibit 1c). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">As in cases past, MBTA 
  officials here profess reliance on vague and standardless standards for their 
  discretionary, viewpoint-based decision to reject the plaintiff's ad campaign 
  in the name of protecting children. The plaintiff urges this Court to right 
  the MBTA's pernicious wrongs once and for all by: (1) declaring the MBTA's advertising 
  space a designated public forum in which the defendants are barred from discriminating 
  based on the content or viewpoint of ads; (2) declaring that the MBTA's rejection 
  of plaintiff's ads was viewpoint-based, in violation of the First Amendment 
  and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; (3) declaring the 
  defendants' advertising policy unconstitutionally vague and lacking in adequate 
  standards; (4) ordering the defendants to display Change the Climate's advertisements 
  without discrimination on MBTA buses, subway trains, and subway stations; (5) 
  permanently enjoining the defendants, their officers, agents, employees, and 
  those persons acting in concert or participation with them, from refusing to 
  sell advertising space on MBTA vehicles and facilities based on the viewpoint 
  of any proposed advertising campaign; (6) permanently enjoining the defendants, 
  their officers, agents, employees, and those persons acting in concert or participation 
  with them from using any advertising policy which permits impermissible content-based 
  or viewpoint-based restrictions on speech; and (7) ordering the defendants to 
  promulgate a viewpoint-neutral policy, subject to the supervision of the Court, 
  that (a) contains well-defined, unambiguous standards for rejecting proposed 
  advertisements; (b) requires policy administrators to articulate specific policy-based 
  reasons for rejection; and (c) provides for a reasonable appeal process. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>II. CHANGE THE CLIMATE'S 
  ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN CONSTITUTES CORE POLITICAL SPEECH ABOUT A MATTER OF IMPORTANT 
  PUBLIC CONCERN, ENTITLED TO THE UTMOST PROTECTION.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">If there is one underlying 
  truth in First Amendment jurisprudence it is that &quot;[t]he freedom of speech 
  and of the press guaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty 
  to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern without previous 
  restraint or fear of subsequent punishment.&quot; Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 
  U.S. 88, 95 (1940). It is beyond debate that the First Amendment &quot;was fashioned 
  to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political 
  and social changes desired by the people.&quot; Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 
  476, 484 (1957). Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; 
  it is the essence of self government. Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 74-75 
  (1964).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Change the Climate seeks 
  to engage the public about an important matter of public concern: the political, 
  economic, health, and social issues surrounding our nation's drug policies. 
  Even if Change the Climate were an organization whose purpose were to advocate 
  for the legalization of marijuana - which it is not - the Supreme Court has 
  made clear that such efforts would not only be protected, but constitute the 
  most important speech we must protect in our democracy. Just as &quot;[l]egislative 
  restrictions on advocacy of the election or defeat of political candidates are 
  wholly at odds with the guarantees of the First Amendment . . . that principle 
  applies equally to the discussion of political policy generally or advocacy 
  of the passage or defeat of legislation.&quot; Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 
  428 (1988)(Discussion of initiative petition to change laws regulating trucking 
  industry is core political speech) (internal citations and quotations omitted). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In founding Change the 
  Climate, Joe White understood what the Meyer Court recognized - that in order 
  to achieve political change down the road, he would &quot;at least have to persuade 
  [the public] that the matter is one deserving of the public scrutiny and debate 
  that would attend its consideration by the whole electorate.&quot; Id. Change 
  the Climate's advertising campaign, advocating that the facts about marijuana 
  be discussed and debated in the public domain, is precisely the &quot;interactive 
  communication concerning political change&quot; that the Court extolled as &quot;core 
  political speech&quot; entitled to the utmost protection. Id. at 421. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Boiled to its essentials, 
  this case is about a prior restraint on core political speech, speech intended 
  to induce citizens to influence their government, because, to quote from the 
  MBTA decision maker's written statement of why she rejected the advertisements, 
  Change the Climate's &quot;mission&quot; conflicted with the MBTA's policies.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> 
  See Exhibit D. Such prior restraints on speech are permitted under only the 
  most dire of circumstances, none of which are present here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>III. THE MBTA'S VIEWPOINT-BASED 
  REJECTION OF CHANGE THE CLIMATE'S ADS VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT UNDER ANY 
  STANDARD OF ANALYSIS FOR SPEECH ON GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The Supreme Court has 
  established three categories of analysis for government restrictions on speech 
  depending on the nature of the forum. In none of them may the government discriminate 
  based on the viewpoint of the expression. &quot;Above all else, the First Amendment 
  means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message 
  [or] its ideas.&quot; Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosely, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">First, in traditional 
  public fora - &quot;places which by long tradition or by government fiat have 
  been devoted to assembly and debate&quot; - the government may not implement 
  content-based restrictions on speech unless they are narrowly-tailored and necessary 
  to serve a compelling state interest. Perry Education Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' 
  Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983); see also Arkansas Educational Television Ass'n 
  v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 677 (1998); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; 
  Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 800 (1985). In addition, the government 
  may employ content-neutral, narrowly-tailored restrictions on time, place, and 
  manner, but only if they serve a significant government interest and leave alternative 
  means of communication available. Id. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Second, designated public 
  fora are created when &quot;the state has opened [its property] for use by the 
  public as a place for expressive activity.&quot; Perry, 460 U.S. at 45. In such 
  fora, the First Amendment &quot;forbids a state to enforce certain exclusions 
  from a forum generally open to the public even if it was not required to create 
  the forum in the first place.&quot; Id. As with a traditional public forum, 
  &quot;[r]easonable time, place and manner regulations are permissible, [but] 
  a content-based prohibition must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling 
  state interest.&quot; Id. at 46.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Third, nonpublic fora 
  - public property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public 
  communication - may be subject to reasonable, content-based restrictions, but 
  the government still may not impose restrictions based on viewpoint. Id.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The doctrine against 
  viewpoint discrimination transcends these formal categories of forum analysis. 
  The government may not, in any forum, regulate speech or restrict access to 
  a forum based on the viewpoint of the speaker. See Good News Club v. Milford 
  Cent. Sch., No. 99-2036, 2001 WL 636202, at *5 (U.S. June 11, 2001) (reiterating 
  that &quot;[t]he State's power to restrict speech . . . is not without limits. 
  The restriction must not discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint&quot;) 
  (citing Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 
  819, 829 (1995)) (&quot;The government must abstain from regulating speech when 
  the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker 
  is the rationale for the restriction.&quot;); see also Lamb's Chapel v. Center 
  Moriches Union Free School District, 508 U.S. 384, 394 (1993) (&quot;[T]he First 
  Amendment forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some 
  viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others.&quot;). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Whether the advertising 
  space on MBTA property constitutes a designated public forum or not, the defendants' 
  viewpoint-based rejection of the plaintiff's ads urging debate on marijuana 
  policy violates one of the most fundamental premises of the First Amendment: 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">If there is any fixed 
  star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, 
  can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or 
  other matters of opinion . . . .</font></p>

  <b>IV. BY ACCEPTING A BROAD RANGE OF ADVERTISEMENTS FOR DISPLAY, THE MBTA HAS 
  INTENTIONALLY CREATED A DESIGNATED PUBLIC FORUM FOR ITS ADVERTISING SPACE. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Following the reasoning 
  of a clear majority of circuits, as well as district courts, that have decided 
  factually analogous cases since the First Circuit declined to reach the issue 
  in AIDS Action, this Court should declare the MBTA's advertising space a designated 
  public forum.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> See New York Magazine v. Metropolitan 
  Transport. Auth., 136 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 1998); Christ's Bride Ministries,

  Rapid Transit Auth., 112 F. Supp.2d 1320, 1327 (N.D. Ga. 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The &quot;forum&quot; 
  at issue in the present case is the MBTA's advertising space. See, e.g., United 
  Food, 163 F.3d at 349 (&quot;Because UFCW seeks access to the advertising space 
  encompassing the outside of SORTA's Queen City Metro buses, this advertising 
  space constitutes the relevant forum&quot;); Air Line Pilots, 45 F.3d at 1149 
  (&quot;The limited nature of the ALPA's desired access renders the display case 
  the relevant forum for the purpose of constitutional inquiry&quot;); Lehman 
  v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 301-02 (1974) (analyzing &quot;car 
  card space&quot; and not public transportation system as a whole); Planned Parenthood, 
  767 F.2d at 1232 (analyzing Chicago Transit Authority advertising system and 
  not greater transportation system); National Abortion Federation, 112 F.Supp.2d 
  at 1327 (N.D. Ga. 2000) (concluding that because MARTA maintained control over 
  the content of the advertising displayed in all its advertising space, &quot;all 
  advertising space controlled by MARTA on its buses and trains, in its stations 
  and surrounding areas&quot; was the relevant forum for purposes of forum analysis). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In order for the Court 
  to determine whether the MBTA's advertising space is a public forum or simply 
  non-public governmental property, the Court must examine both the MBTA's intent 
  in establishing and maintaining the advertising space and the actual practice 
  in making that space available to the public. See Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802; 
  Stewart v. District of Columbia Armory Bd., 863 F.2d 1013, 1016 (D.C. Cir. 1988). 
  &quot;Inquiry into intent, however, is not merely a matter of deference to a 
  stated purpose.&quot; Air Line Pilots, 45 F.3d at 1152. Instead, intent is a 
  fact-specific inquiry that is driven by an examination of two factors, the policy 
  and practice of the government with respect to the underlying property and the 
  nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity of the 
  kind at issue. See Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802-03; see also United Food, 163 
  F.3d at 353 (6th Cir. 1998) (following Christ's Bride and noting that &quot;we 
  ... must closely examine whether in practice [the transit authority] has consistently 
  enforced its written policy in order to satisfy ourselves that [its ] stated 
  policy represents its actual policy&quot;) (citing cases). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">A. The MBTA's stated 
  advertising policies made its advertising space widely available for all forms 
  of speech, political and commercial, with only the barest of restrictions. These 
  policies created a public forum.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The MBTA has had several 
  different written policies concerning access to its advertising space. The record 
  is unclear, at best, as to what policies were in effect at the time Change the 
  Climate's advertisements were rejected.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> For purposes 
  of summary judgment, however, none of these policies was so limiting of public 
  access as to reduce the MBTA's advertising space from a public forum to a non-public 
  one. See, e.g. New York Magazine, 136 F.3d at 126, n.1 (declining to decide 
  similar issue); cf. Hopper, 241 F.3d at 1079, n. 10 (&quot;Having created the 
  designated public forum, no trial is needed to determine what might have been 
  when we have before us undisputed facts as to what actually occurred.&quot;) 
  Indeed, the plaintiff encourages the Court to review the1999 bid specifications, 
  Exhibit O, as well as any other purported policies that the defendants now maintain 
  could have applied to Shorter's decision, as one factor in determining whether 
  the MBTA's advertising space was intended to be a designated public forum.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> 
  In the final analysis, whichever policy or policies the MBTA now assert may 
  have guided the MBTA's conduct in rejecting the plaintiff's ads - whether it 
  be the 1999 bid specifications (that were not yet in effect), the 1992 bid specifications 
  (that neither Shorter nor Prince were certain were still in effect), the 1995 
  Mabardy letter (the only document Prince was sure was in effect but that has 
  absolutely no application to CTC's ads), or the 1993 Commercial and Public Service 
  Advertising Policy (that the First Circuit rejected in AIDS Action) - none of 
  the policies purport to restrict any one category of speech, or speaker, within 
  the meaning of the public forum doctrine. See Exhibits M-P, W, X, Z and Plaintiff's 
  Statement of Uncontested Facts (&quot;SOF&quot;), pp. 6-9, 15-20, 24-29).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">As argued below, the 
  undisputed record evidence demonstrates that whatever the MBTA now argues concerning 
  its purported policies, in practice it has accepted the broadest range of advertisements. 
  Furthermore, the evidence shows that the MBTA's application of policies to its 
  advertising decisions has been haphazard, and based on subjective and generalized 
  criteria leading to decisions that continue to give rise to inferences of viewpoint 
  discrimination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">B. The MBTA displays 
  advertisements on a broad range of topics, including messages concerning drugs, 
  advocating viewpoints with which MBTA officials agree. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">There can be no doubt 
  that for at least the past decade the MBTA has displayed and continues to display 
  advertisements on a broad range of topics, both commercial and noncommercial, 
  including political and social public interest messages. The MBTA has opened 
  its advertising space to all comers (except tobacco companies) See SOF, pp. 
  6-9.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> For example, Prince testified at his deposition 
  as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">QUESTION: Are you aware 
  of any time the T has rejected a proposed ad even though the ad met its advertising 
  guidelines?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">ANSWER: Not to my knowledge, 
  no.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">QUESTION: Is there any 
  group or organization that the T will not accept advertising from if the advertising 
  meets the guidelines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Objection to form.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">ANSWER: I don't know.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">QUESTION: Are you aware

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">ANSWER: No, I don't know.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Objection.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">QUESTION: Does the T 
  make its advertising space available to anybody who is willing to pay for it 
  and provide an ad that meets all of the guidelines?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">ANSWER: Yes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Prince Dep., pp. 46-47.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><br>
  Moreover, it is undisputed that the MBTA has displayed, and continues to display 
  advertisements on the same subject as Change the Climate's proposed ads - advertisements 
  advocating the message that parents talk with their kids about the &quot;truth&quot; 
  about drugs, and specifically &quot;pot.&quot; See Exhibits Q and R. Several 
  courts have found such evidence that a transit authority allowed public interest 
  or political advertisements compelling proof that transit advertising space 
  was intended as a designated public forum. See, e.g., National Abortion Federation 
  v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 112 F.Supp.2d 1320, 1327 (N.D. 
  Ga. 2000) (holding that by permitting &quot;various forms of public interest 
  speech and speech by non-profit entities, MARTA has opened its advertising forum 
  to such speech.&quot;) (citing Forbes, 523 U.S. at 679); United Food, 163 F.3d 
  at 355 (&quot;Acceptance of political and public-issue advertisements, which 
  by their nature generate conflict, signals a willingness on the part of the 
  government to open the property to controversial speech.&quot;); cf. East Timor, 
  71 F.Supp.2d at 345 (holding that in light of the transportation department's 
  inconsistency in practice regarding municipal approval of applications for temporary 
  street name signs of a political nature, and the fact that the city's policy 
  did not by its own terms prohibit signs of a political nature, the forum had 
  not been limited to signs of a non-political nature).<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">C. The MBTA advertising 
  policies are based on subjective criteria and are haphazardly enforced, creating 
  an inference of viewpoint discrimination. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">As the Ninth Circuit 
  recently observed, &quot;consistency in application is the hallmark of any policy 
  designed to preserve the non-public status of a forum.&quot; Hopper, 241 F3d 
  at 1078. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Neither Prince as CEO 
  of the MBTA, nor Shorter as Director of Marketing of the MBTA - the two MBTA 
  officials who had the sole authority to make decisions on advertising at all 
  times relevant to this action - could say which policies governed the MBTA's 
  advertising decisions or showed any understanding of what First Amendment protections 
  were afforded to political advertisers at the time the plaintiff submitted its 
  ads.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The MBTA has come forward 
  with a grand total of seventeen advertisements that it has rejected over the 
  last decade,<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> less than two rejections per year. 
  See United Food, 163 F.3d at 353 (suggesting that the rejection of a small number 
  of proposed advertisements under a policy is strong evidence that the transit 
  authority has permitted &quot;virtually unlimited access to its advertising 
  space or grants permission as a matter of course&quot;); Christ's Bride, 148 
  F.3d at 252 (concluding that transit authority did not maintain &quot;tight 
  control&quot; over the forum where &quot;at least 99% of all ads are posted 
  without objection&quot;). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Moreover, at least one 
  of the purported standards by which the MBTA rejected the plaintiff's ads, i.e., 
  the &quot;promotional materials harmful to children&quot; standard, has been 
  inconsistently applied. For example, the MBTA accepts advertisements for alcohol 
  products, clearly promoting the consumption of alcohol. It cannot be disputed 
  that such advertising represents &quot;promotional materials harmful to juveniles.&quot;<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> 
  In addition, an advertisement currently displayed on the outside of MBTA buses 
  shows an attractive woman sitting on a motor scooter holding what appears to 
  be cigarette (or possibly a marijuana joint) in her hand, with text that reads: 
  &quot;Al Italia. Let's Create A Buzz.&quot; See Aunkst Aff., 9. This ad glamorizes 
  the smoking of some substance - a substance that provides a &quot;buzz&quot; 
  - whether it be a cigarette or perhaps even marijuana. Regardless, the ad promotes 
  something harmful to children and is in violation of the MBTA's tobacco policy, 
  as well as the double entendre standard that Shorter suggested applied to Change 
  the Climate's ads in her deposition. Unlike alcohol and cigarettes, both commercial 
  products which undisputedly cause harm to children, there is no evidence that 
  the political ads at issue in this case would cause any actual harm to anyone.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Several courts have determined 
  that transit authorities had designated their advertising space a public forum 
  on the basis of such inconsistencies. For example, in one of the seminal transit 
  advertising cases, Planned Parenthood Ass'n v. Chicago Transit Auth., 767 F.2d 
  1225 (7th Cir. 1985), the Seventh Circuit held that the Chicago Transit Authority 
  (CTA) bus advertising system was a designated public forum because the record 
  revealed a &quot;laissez-faire policy&quot; of allocating advertising space, 
  notwithstanding purported policies contrived during the course of litigation. 
  Id. at 1232-33. In that case, the transit authority refused to lease ad space 
  to Planned Parenthood for abortion-related displays on the basis of its standard 
  to refuse &quot;immoral, vulgar, or disreputable advertisements.&quot; Id. at 
  1227. Finding that the purported policy amounted to nothing more than a &quot;general 
  contractual directive&quot; and not a &quot;system of control,&quot; and that 
  &quot;[a]ccess to CTA's advertising system was virtually guaranteed to anyone 
  willing to pay the fee,&quot; the Court held that the CTA had designated its 
  advertising space a public forum. Id. at 1233.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Like the CTA in Planned 
  Parenthood, the MBTA has been willing to accommodate advertisers of all types, 
  commercial and noncommercial, accepting both political and public interest advertising 
  for years. The MBTA simply cannot make any credible argument that it attempted 
  to limit the forum to some categories of speakers and not others. Compare Lehman, 
  418 U.S. at 301-02 (finding no public forum where Shaker Heights had a consistently-enforced 
  written policy of rejecting all political and public-issue advertising, and 
  in its twenty-six years of operation, the transit system had not permitted any 
  political or public-issue advertising on its vehicles) and Children of the Rosary,154 
  F.3d at 976 (holding that the city had not opened up its bus panels as a designated 
  public forum based on its past policy and practice of consistently prohibiting 
  political and religious advertising on its buses) with Lebron,749 F.2d at 896 
  (holding that the transit authority's metro space was a designated public forum, 
  distinguishing Lehman because transit authority had, in fact, accepted political 
  advertising in the past) and Ysleta Federation of Teachers v. Ysleta School 
  District, 720 F.2d 1429, 1433 (5th Cir. 1983) (holding that a school's internal 
  mail system, unlike the internal mail system which the Supreme Court determined 
  was not a public forum in Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 
  460 U.S. 37, was a public forum because the state had &quot;opened the mail 
  system to all employee organizations without distinction.&quot;). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Similarly, in a more 
  recent case, Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., 
  148 F.3d 242 (3d Cir. 1998), the Third Circuit rejected the transit authority's 
  argument that by retaining &quot;sole discretion&quot; to reject or to remove 
  any advertisement that it deemed &quot;objectionable,&quot; it did not create 
  a designated public forum. Id. at 244. In that case, transit authority officials 
  removed a poster ad that read &quot;Women Who Choose Abortion Suffer More &amp; 
  Deadlier Breast Cancer,&quot; based on their determination that the ad was &quot;misleading&quot; 
  and therefore &quot;objectionable&quot; under the policy. Id. The transit authority 
  accepted &quot;a broad range of advertisements for display,&quot; including 
  ads addressing &quot;sex, family planning and related topics&quot; - including 
  two ads favoring abortion rights. Id. at 252. In light of this record, and the 
  authority's actual practice of &quot;permitting virtually unlimited access to 
  the forum,&quot; the court held that the ad space was a designated public forum. 
  Id. Significantly, the court held that the transit authority's longstanding 
  practice of allowing ads on controversial subjects &quot;as a matter of course&quot; 
  trumped any argument that no public forum is created when the government requires 
  speakers to obtain permission before engaging in expressive activity in the 
  forum. Id. at 252-55. This case is right on point. Just as the transit authority 
  had accepted advertisements advocating other messages on the same topic as the 
  topic at issue, i.e., abortion, so too has the MBTA accepted advertisements 
  advocating messages about drugs - and talking to kids about marijuana specifically. 
  (See Aunkst Aff., 7). Just as &quot;the topic of abortion and its health effects&quot; 
  were &quot;encompassed within the purpose of the forum,&quot; so too is the 
  topic of drugs and its effects on society encompassed within the purpose of 
  the MBTA's advertising space.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Another recent advertising 
  case, United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union Local 1099 v. Southwest Ohio 
  Reg'l Transit Auth.,163 F.3d 341, 353 (6th Cir. 1998), is also instructive. 
  At issue in this case was a political pro-union advertisement that the regional 
  transit authority rejected on the basis of a policy that purported to restrict 
  advertising on &quot;controversial public issues&quot; that could &quot;adversely 
  affect [the authority's] ability to attract and maintain ridership,&quot; and 
  that also required that all ads &quot;be aesthetically pleasing and enhance 
  the environment for riders and customers and the authority's standing in the 
  community.&quot; 163 F.3d at 346. In this case, as in so many others, the actual 
  practice of the transit authority was to accept a wide variety of advertisements 
  for its bus exteriors, from commercial advertisements to public service, public 
  issue, and political advertisements. Id. at 355. Rejecting arguments by the 
  authority that this standard differed in any material way from those at issue 
  in Christ's Bride, the court concluded &quot;we believe the lack of definitive 
  standards guiding the application of [the transit authority's] policy permits 
  [it] to reject a proposed advertisement deemed objectionable for any reason.&quot; 
  Id. at 354. (citing Planned Parenthood, 767 F.2d at 1230). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Like the &quot;disreputableness&quot; 
  standard at issue in Planned Parenthood, the &quot;objectionable&quot; standard 
  in Christ's Bride, and the &quot;controversial&quot; standard in United Food, 
  the MBTA's policy that vested Shorter with the discretion to reject any advertisement 
  she deemed &quot;harmful to juveniles&quot; or not of sufficiently &quot;reputable 
  character&quot;did not convert the MBTA's advertising space from a designated 
  public forum to a non-public location. See also Hopper, 241 F3d at 1077-78 (&quot;[S]tandards 
  for inclusion or exclusion must be unambiguous and definite if the concept of 
  designated public forum is to retain any vitality whatsoever.&quot;) (quoting 
  Christ's Bride and collecting numerous illustrative cases in which courts have 
  taken defendants to task for their use of overly subjective criteria). Subjective 
  and generalized standards cannot create &quot;categories&quot; of speech for 
  the purposes of public forum analysis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">On the contrary, such 
  standards often translate into officials' unfettered, impermissible discretion.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> 
  The deposition testimony of Albertelli and Shorter shows that Change the Climate's 
  ad campaign was first screened for its &quot;provocative&quot; nature, see Albertelli 
  Dep., pp.36, 37, 50-51, and ultimately rejected because it is &quot;really a 
  reform legalization&quot; organization whose &quot;mission&quot; is &quot;in 
  conflict with the [MBTA] guidelines.&quot; Shorter Dep., pp.56-61; see also 
  Exhibit L. The plaintiff suggests, as do each of these cases, that government 
  officials have no business making these kinds of judgment calls - especially 
  when the speech at issue is of a political nature. As the Planned Parenthood 
  Court cautioned, &quot;[w]e question whether a regulation of speech that has 
  as its touchstone a government official's subjective view that the speech is 
  &quot;controversial&quot; could ever pass constitutional muster.&quot; Id. at 
  1229 (citing cases); cf. New York Magazine, 136 F.3d at 131 (&quot;Where there 
  are both commercial and political elements present in speech, even the determination 
  whether speech is commercial or not may be fraught with ambiguity and should 
  not be vested in an agency such as [a transit authority].)&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Ultimately, and rather 
  transparently, the defendant transit authorities in each of the above cases 
  sought to limit political speech precisely because of the very political nature 
  of the speech. As the United Food Court rightly warned: &quot;Just as a governmental 
  entity may not avoid First Amendment scrutiny simply by declaring that it is 
  not creating a public forum, it may not demonstrate intent to keep the forum 
  nonpublic simply by declaring a purpose that involves excluding protected speech 
  based on its content.&quot; Id. at 355 (citing New York Magazine, 136 F.3d at 
  129-30). This is exactly what the MBTA has done.<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>V. THE MBTA'S RESTRICTION 
  ON CHANGE THE CLIMATE'S PROTECTED POLITICAL SPEECH WAS NOT NARROWLY TAILORED 
  TO SERVE A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">A. This Court Must Apply 
  Strict Scrutiny to the Defendants' Prior Restraint on Core Political Speech 
  in a Public Forum.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><br>
  &quot;If the government excludes a speaker who falls within the class to which 
  a designated public forum is made generally available, its action is subject 
  to strict scrutiny.&quot; Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 667 (1998); see also First National 
  Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 786 (1978) (reiterating that when 
  a law burdens core political speech, the Court applies &quot;exacting scrutiny&quot;and 
  will uphold the restriction only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding 
  state interest.) This strict scrutiny means that &quot;[f]or the state to enforce 
  a content-based exclusion, it must show that its regulation is necessary to 
  serve a compelling state interest, and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve 
  that end.&quot; Perry, 460 U.S. at 45; see also Forsyth County v. Nationalist 
  Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 130-31 (1992) (&quot;[A] law subjecting the exercise 
  of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license must contain 
  narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority . 
  . . . The reasoning is simple: If the permit scheme involves appraisal of facts, 
  the exercise of judgment, and the formation of an opinion, by the licensing 
  authority, the danger of censorship and of abridgment of our precious First 
  Amendment freedoms is too great to be permitted.&quot;) (internal citations 
  omitted). <br>
  Change the Climate's proposed advertisements &quot;fall within the same class&quot; 
  as other public service and political ads the MBTA runs, such as those in Exhibits 
  Q and R. See also Aunkst Aff., 5-9. The MBTA's decision to exclude these advertisements 
  thus is subject to strict scrutiny and, in order for its conduct to be approved 
  by this Court, the MBTA must prove that the restriction was &quot;narrowly tailored 
  to serve an overriding state interest&quot; and that the MBTA employed &quot;narrow, 
  objective, and definite standards&quot; to exclude Change the Climate from this 
  public forum. The MBTA fails to come anywhere close to this almost impossible 
  burden.<br>
  The MBTA's reasons for declining Change the Climate's advertisements are elusive. 
  Shorter, who made the decision, simply stated in her fax to Albertelli that 
  Change the Climate's &quot;mission&quot; was to legalize marijuana and this 
  &quot;mission&quot; conflicted with the MBTA drug policy. See Exhibit D. Prince's 
  reasons for the MBTA's refusal to run Change the Climate's campaign are even 
  more obtuse. He testified as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">QUESTION: Is there anything 
  in that 1995 guideline that's violated by these three specific ads? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">ANSWER: I believe that 
  it tells children to break the law.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">QUESTION: Can you read 
  me the part of the guideline that's violated by those ads, please?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">ANSWER: The terms, &quot;frightening 
  or of a nature to frighten children, either emotionally or physically, showing 
  them language or pictures that describe or depict violent criminal or brutal 
  activities or the end result of violent or brutal activities that were intended 
  - whether such violence or brutality was intended or not in a manner which causes 
  a child in physical or emotional distress.&quot; This could put a child in jail. 
  That's emotional distress.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">(Prince Dep., p. 32-33.) 
  Prince further testified that the ads violated the MBTA's guidelines prohibiting 
  ads depicting &quot;violent criminal content&quot; (Id. at 37), as well as those 
  prohibiting ads that denigrate &quot;groups based by gender, religion, race 
  or ethnic affiliation.&quot; (Id. at 38.) The Court should keep in mind that 
  these silly statements were made under oath by the MBTA's top official. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">These justifications 
  for the government's conduct in stifling speech promoting peaceful change in 
  the law are absurd. They are the result of such vague &quot;guidelines&quot; 
  as to provide no guidance at all, leaving open the possibility that an advertisement 
  that says &quot;I've got three great kids. I love them more than anything. I 
  don't want them to smoke pot. But I know jail is a lot more dangerous than smoking 
  pot&quot; (Exhibit J) is going to cause &quot;emotional distress&quot; to children 
  because it will cause them to go to jail. By this standard, the song &quot;I 
  Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; could be banned because it promotes infidelity. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Not only do these subjective 
  standards fail strict scrutiny, but the plaintiff suggests that the MBTA's outright 
  prohibition on Change the Climate's ad campaign constitutes a prior restraint 
  on speech under the seminal transit advertising case. See Lebron v. Washington 
  Metro. Transit Auth.,749 F.2d 893, 896 (D.C. Cir. 1984); see also New York Magazine 
  v. Metropolitan Transport. Auth., 136 F.3d 123, 131-32 (2d Cir. 1998) (expanding 
  upon Lebron); East Timor Action Network, Inc. v. City of New York, 71 Supp.2d 
  334, 347-48 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (collecting Supreme Court and circuit precedent). 
  Accord Jews for Jesus, Inc., 984 F.2d 1319, 1327 (1st Cir. 1993) (reiterating 
  that a prior restraint is only permissible &quot;if it contains certain procedural 
  safeguards designed to protect against censorship&quot; and where it is &quot;content 
  neutral&quot; limiting &quot;the time for issuing authorization&quot; and permitting 
  &quot;prompt judicial review.&quot;).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Subject to a limited 
  number of exceptions - most notably, reasonable time, place and manner regulations 
  - political speech may not constitutionally be restricted in a public forum.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> 
  Lebron, 749 F.2d. at 896. In Lebron, the D.C. transit authority prohibited the 
  plaintiff from displaying his political advertisement critical of the Reagan 
  administration on the basis of its self-proclaimed &quot;responsibility to the 
  public in preventing purposeful deceptions&quot; and its &quot;proprietary interest 
  in raising advertising revenues from its advertising space.&quot; Id. at 896-97. 
  Judge Bork, writing for the panel that included Judge Starr and then-Judge Scalia, 
  saw the transit authority's refusal to accept the plaintiff's political poster 
  for display because of its content &quot;in advance of actual expression&quot; 
  for what it was: &quot;a clear-cut prior restraint&quot; that prevented him 
  &quot;from saying what he wanted to say&quot; in the designated public forum 
  the transit authority had created, by accepting political advertisements. Id. 
  (citing cases). Soundly rejecting the transit authority's argument that the 
  restriction was a reasonable time, place and manner restriction, the Court warned 
  that any &quot;assessment of the deceptiveness of a message necessarily involves 
  a judgment about the substance and content of that message.&quot; Id. at 896-99.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The Lebron case is exactly 
  on point. Despite AIDS Action and cases prior, MBTA agents continue to believe 
  that it is their job to decide what advertisements are and are not in the public 
  interest, First Amendment protections to political speakers be damned. Whether 
  it is by Elissa Albertelli's judgment that an ad is &quot;provocative&quot; 
  or by Lucy Shorter's personal belief that the &quot;mission&quot; of an organization 
  &quot;conflicts with MBTA guidelines,&quot; or by Robert Prince's opinion that 
  certain words have a &quot;double entendre meaning,&quot;or by Lydia Rivera's 
  belief that a certain segment of the MBTA's riders are going to be &quot;more 
  susceptible&quot; to a particular message or speaker - applying these amorphous, 
  inconsistently applied standards, &quot;involves an exercise of discretion and 
  subjective judgment on the part of [MBTA] officials,&quot; that, &quot;even 
  if applied pursuant to procedural safeguards,&quot; would be &quot;unconstitutionally 
  overbroad as applied to political speech.&quot; Lebron, 749 F.2d at 899; see 
  also New York Magazine, 135 F.3d at 131-32 (taking the reasoning of Lebron one 
  step further, suggesting that the strict rules of prior restraint should extend 
  to purely commercial speech, seeing &quot;no reason why the requirement of procedural 
  safeguards should be relaxed whether speech is commercial or not.&quot;).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Because it is undisputed 
  that Change the Climate's ads intend to convey a political message, that the 
  MBTA's restrictions cannot be construed as reasonable time, place and manner 
  restrictions, and that the MBTA prevented Change the Climate from displaying 
  its advertising &quot;in advance of actual expression,&quot; the Plaintiff urges 
  this Court to follow Lebron and its progeny and hold as a matter of law that 
  the MBTA's decision to prevent Change the Climate from posting its political 
  advertisements was an impermissible prior restraint - unconstitutionally lacking 
  in procedural safeguards - on its right to engage in core political speech.

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">A. The MBTA's Other Purported 
  Interests Do Not Survive Strict Scrutiny. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">1. The purported interest 
  in protecting children from harm is too speculative; furthermore, it is the 
  MBTA that is causing actual harm to society, including children, by its censorship

  ridiculous.&quot; Boston Herald, &quot;Cellucci Just Says No&quot; September 
  22, 2000. Whatever political mileage may have been gained by this statement, 
  courts have long recognized that children have First Amendment rights and that 
  messages that &quot;may be harmful to children&quot; in the eyes of government 
  regulators are protected expression that may not be abridged on the basis of 
  mere speculation. See Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-14 
  (1975); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District, 393 U.S. 503, 511-14,

  2001); see also Hopper at 1081-82 (holding the mere fact that &quot;children

  244 F.3d at 573. Reversing the lower court and enjoining the ordinance in favor 
  of the manufacturers and their trade association, the court held that the city 
  did not show a compelling basis for believing that violent video games caused 
  actual harm either to children or to the public at large, and that plaintiffs 
  demonstrated a strong likelihood of success in proving the city's regulation

  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Now that eighteen-year-olds 
  have the right to vote, it is obvious that they must be allowed the freedom

  the franchise. And since an eighteen-year-old's right to vote is a right personal 
  to him rather than a right to be exercised on his behalf by his parents, the 
  right of parents to enlist the aid of the state to shield their children from 
  ideas of which the parents disapprove cannot be plenary either. People are unlikely 
  to become well-functioning, independent-minded adults and responsible citizens

  2. The MBTA's purported interest in encouraging compliance with the present

  changes in those laws. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Shorter testified that

  and an intent to incite imminent lawlessness on the other: &quot;[A]t least 
  so long as there is no showing of an intent to incite disobedience to or disruption

  flag burning case, the State of Texas argued that its interest in preventing 
  breaches of the peace justified convicting the plaintiff in that case for flag 
  desecration, a position the Court said &quot;amounts to a claim that an audience 
  that takes serious offense at particular expression is necessarily likely to 
  disturb the peace and that the expression may be prohibited on this basis.&quot; 
  Id. at 407-08. Pointing out that no disturbance of the peace actually occurred 
  or threatened to occur because of the plaintiff's burning of the flag, the Court

  violence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Thus, we have not permitted 
  the government to assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite

  THE FORUM, THE MBTA'S STANDARDS AS APPLIED TO CHANGE THE CLIMATE'S CORE POLITICAL

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Regardless of the forum 
  at issue - whether it is a traditional public forum, a designated public forum 
  or a limited public forum - &quot;[i]t is axiomatic that the government may 
  not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys.&quot; 
  Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 827-29; see also Metro Display Advertising, Inc. v. 
  City of Victorville, 143 F.3d 1191, 1195 (9th Cir. 1998) (&quot;The government 
  cannot regulate a private individual's speech in order to promote or restrain 
  promotion of that individual's viewpoint . . . . [n]o matter whether the bus

  Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 811). The Court's decision this term in Good News Club 
  reaffirmed the prior holdings in Rosenberger and other forum cases, confirming 
  that government restrictions on private speech even in a limited public or nonpublic 
  forum may not discriminate based on viewpoint.<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> 
  See Good News Club, No. 99-2036, 2001 WL 636202, at * 5. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">As the First Circuit 
  made clear in AIDS Action, in order for the MBTA's restrictions on speech to 
  pass constitutional muster, MBTA officials would &quot;at the least, need to 
  act according to neutral standards&quot; and &quot;to apply these standards 
  in such a way that there is no appearance that 'the [government] is seeking 
  to handicap the expression of particular ideas.'&quot; Id. at 39 (quoting R.A.V. 
  v. City of St. Paul, Minnesota, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 2549 (1992)). The court recognized 
  that &quot;this requires the government to apply its standards quite precisely&quot; 
  because this is the burden the government assumes . . . when it undertakes to 
  proscribe speech on the basis of its content.&quot; Id. at 39-40. Here, as in 
  AIDS Action,&quot;there can be no doubt that the MBTA's Policy on its face and 
  as applied to [Change the Climate's] proposed ads, is not content-neutral,&quot; 
  id. at 24, and that once again, the MBTA has not come close to satisfying its 
  heavy burden.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The record evidence in 
  this case is overwhelming. No matter which of its potpourri of policies the 
  MBTA points to as justification for rejecting the plaintiff's ads, all of the 
  purported standards are impermissibly content-based, inviting the rejection 
  of Change the Climate's proposed advertisements because of a viewpoint to which 
  MBTA officials have expressed hostility, while allowing the posting of advertisements 
  by groups such as the Partnership for Drug-Free America expressing messages 
  on the same topic that MBTA officials, in their estimation, view as beneficial 
  to juveniles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">As in AIDS Action, the 
  MBTA's advertising decisions continue to be based on policies that are applied 
  inconsistently at best and in a discriminatory manner at worst. See SOF, pp. 
  21-24. As in AIDS Action, the &quot;MBTA engaged in content discrimination which 
  gave rise to an appearance of viewpoint discrimination, and [] it has failed 
  to explain that appearance away.&quot; 42 F.3d at 19. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>VII. ASSUMING ARGUENDO 
  THAT THE MBTA'S ADVERTISING SPACE WAS A NON-PUBLIC FORUM, THE DEFENDANTS' DECISION 
  TO REJECT CHANGE THE CLIMATE'S ADVERTISEMENTS FAILS EVEN THE REASONABLENESS 
  TEST.</b><br>
  <br>
  The MBTA's decision to reject the plaintiff's ads was unreasonable as a matter 
  of law. See, e.g. East Timor, 71 F. Supp. 2d at 347 (holding the proposed political 
  signs at issue were not &quot;inconsistent with the intended use of the forum, 
  and thus, the City's denials were not reasonable.&quot;); Christ's Bride, 148 
  F.3d at 256-57 (&quot;[t]he government has offered no basis on which to conclude 
  that the speech in question would interfere with the accepted purposes of the 
  advertising space. . . .[it] acted as a censor, limiting speech because it found 
  it to be 'misleading' and these actions were unreasonable) (distinguishing Lehman 
  and its progeny). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">And again, more importantly, 
  &quot;[e]ven in a nonpublic forum, the category that the [MBTA] officials contend 
  the [MBTA's advertising space] should be classified in, the government violates 
  the First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the 
  point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject.&quot; Metro Display 
  Advertising, Inc.,v. City of Victorville, 143 F.3d at 1195. In short, as the 
  Supreme Court reiterated just days ago, &quot;[b]ecause the restriction is viewpoint 
  discriminatory,&quot; this Court &quot;need not decide whether it is unreasonable 
  in light of the purposes served by the forum.&quot; Good News Club v. Milford 
  Central School, 2001 WL 636202 at p. 5 (June 11, 2001). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>VII. THE MORE THINGS 
  CHANGE THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME: AS IN AIDS ACTION, THE MBTA'S PURPORTED 
  STANDARDS CONTINUE TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE AND OVERBROAD.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The MBTA's purported 
  standards - whichever ones the defendants then or now argue applied to Shorter's 
  rejection of the plaintiff's ad campaign - are woefully inadequate. See, e.g., 
  National Abortion Federation v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 112 
  F.Supp.2d 1320, 1327 (N.D. GA 2000) (&quot;While different applications by different 
  officials may not always mean that the policy or statue is vague, in the instant 
  matter it illustrates the subjective and arbitrary nature of the policy and 
  suggests that there is a potential for abuse.&quot;).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">However the MBTA's policies 
  may have changed in the years since AIDS Action, whether &quot;updated&quot; 
  or &quot;revised&quot; or whatever the case may be, one thing is abundantly 
  clear: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">these policies remain 
  unconstitutional on their face and in their application for their vagueness 
  and overbreadth. As in AIDS Action, there continues to be an absence of clear 
  standards, an absence that forces decisions to be made on an ad hoc and subjective 
  basis.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup> Just as the MBTA's purported exclusion 
  of messages &quot;pertaining to sexual conduct&quot; was &quot;so vague and 
  broad&quot; as to exclude AIDS Action's protected speech and arguably &quot;much 
  of the clothing and movie advertising commonly seen on billboards and in magazines,&quot; 
  so too is the MBTA's purported exclusion of all messages regarding &quot;promotional 
  materials harmful to juveniles&quot; or those containing &quot;graphic, violent 
  and disturbing content&quot; so utterly discretionary and overbroad as to allow 
  for the exclusion of the plaintiff's political ads and the Menino-sponsored 
  anti-binge drinking ad, yet simultaneously allow for the regular posting of 
  alcohol products as well as any of the more innocuous food products, detergents, 
  or other commercial products regularly displayed by the MBTA which could conceivably 
  be harmful to juveniles. AIDS Action, 42 F.3d at 36; see also United Food, 163 
  F.3d at 359-60 (holding transit authority advertising policy facially unconstitutional 
  on vagueness grounds because it was &quot;not susceptible to objective definition&quot; 
  and vested in decision-makers &quot;an impermissible degree of discretion&quot; 
  and on overbreadth grounds because &quot;any prohibition against 'controversial 
  advertisements' unquestionably allows for viewpoint discrimination.&quot;).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">And that is but the tip 
  of the iceberg. The MBTA standards not only give rise to the &quot;appearance&quot; 
  of viewpoint discrimination that was present in AIDS Action, but as applied 
  constitute viewpoint discrimination in practice, discrimination applied in the 
  present case to core political speech. The MBTA policies could be declared null 
  and void on that basis alone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>CONCLUSION</b></font></p>

    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><a name="3"></a> There 
    is no question that the MBTA actually rejected Change the Climate's proposed 
    advertisements. Lucy Shorter's memorandum to Elissa Albertelli refusing to 
    run the ads says, &quot;The Change the Climate promotes the use of marijuana 
    in a suttle (sic) way and is really a reform marijuana in a effort to legalize? 
    The T's appearance and character &amp; drug-alcohol policy is in conflict 
    with their mission.&quot; See Exhibit D. Based on this memo, Albertelli wrote 
    to Joe White, &quot;Regretfully, I've attached the response from the Transit 
    Authority regarding &quot;Change the Climate&quot; campaign. Their reasons 
    for not accepting this campaign are clearly stated in the info provided. Please 
    call me when you get a chance.&quot; See Exhibit K (emphasis added). Directly 
    to this point, the MBTA answered an interrogatory asking whether it would 
    accept the three ads proposed by Change the Climate by stating, &quot;For 
    the reasons set forth in Answer No. 2, the MBTA will not accept any of the 
    advertisements attached to the complaint as Exhibit A for placement on MBTA 
    facilities and vehicles.&quot; See Exhibit S (emphasis added). Lest there 
    be any doubt, Prince was asked point blank the following at his deposition 
    (Prince Dep., p. 27):<br>
    QUESTION: Would you run these three ads? (Objection)<br>
    ANSWER: No.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li value="5"> <font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><a name="5"></a>The 
    First Circuit did not reach the issue of whether the MBTA's advertising space 
    is a designated public forum in the AIDS Action case. The court felt that 
    it should not reach such an important issue without the benefit of a well-developed 
    record (the record before the court was a preliminary injunction record it 
    viewed as &quot;sparse&quot;) and, secondarily, the court hesitated because 
    of the &quot;murky&quot; state of the law on public fora at the time. AIDS 
    Action, 42 F.3d at 33-35. Taking its cue from the that decision, the plaintiff 
    has attempted to present a fully developed record for this court that includes 
    (1) &quot;precious evidence&quot; concerning the MBTA's practice of accepting 
    and rejecting advertisements over the last decade to the present and (2) evidence 
    that belies the anticipated post-hoc argument by the defendants that the MBTA 
    is now, and has always been, a &quot;vigilant gatekeeper&quot; with regard 
    to advertising. Id.at 35. In consideration of the record now before this court, 
    and in light of the developments in the law on public fora - particularly 
    with respect to transit advertising in recent cases - the plaintiff suggests 
    that now is the time to decide this important issue. While the plaintiff is 
    confident the more narrowly drawn holding of AIDS Action has equal application 
    in this case (see pp. 31-35, infra.), it is the broader designated public 
    forum holding, and its implication of strict scrutiny, that will serve the 
    plaintiff, and future political speakers who seek to advertise their messages 
    on MBTA property without fear of discrimination, with the greatest measure 
    of justice. See, e.g., United Food,163 F.3d at 349 (6th Cir. 1998) (affirming 
    preliminary injunction, finding for the plaintiff union advertiser against 
    the defendant transit authority on all alternative grounds argued). <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><a name="6"></a> Shorter 
    relied on a policy, see Exhibit M, which was taken from a 1999 bid proposal 
    for the contract that was to replace the one in effect at the time. There 
    is no evidence that policy was in effect when she rejected Change the Climate's 
    advertisements. Prince acknowledged that this policy went into effect later, 
    when the new contract began. See Prince Dep., pp. 12-13. Exhibit N is the 
    MBTA's drug and alcohol free workplace policy, which Shorter also says she 
    relied on in rejecting the Change the Climate campaign. This document, too, 
    is from the 1999 bid proposal. In addition, Prince referred to a policy he 
    called &quot;the Mabardy letter,&quot; see Exhibit W, which prohibits advertising 
    that is &quot;indecent as to child viewers&quot; or &quot;of a nature to frighten 
    children.&quot; Finally, a Commercial and Public Service Advertising Policy, 
    adopted in February 1993, see Exhibit X, might have been in effect at the 
    relevant time. Shorter testified, however, that she did not know if that policy 
    had ever been in effect, and if it were, it was not in effect after 1995. 
    See Shorter Dep., pp. 29, l. 21-24; p. 30, l., 1-8. Exhibit X is the very 
    policy that the First Circuit concluded was &quot;almost impossible to understand,&quot; 
    and created &quot;opportunities for discrimination . . . [that] have been 
    borne out in practice&quot; in the AIDS Action case. 42 F.3d at 37-38, 40. 
    Finally, Exhibit Z contains the bid specifications for the contract between 
    PTD and the MBTA. See Shorter Dep., p. 17. At his deposition, however, Prince 
    testified that he could not recall whether or not he applied this document 
    to any of his decisions to reject or accept proposed advertisements one way 
    or the other during the 1999-2000 time period. See Prince Dep., pp. 7-9. Indeed, 
    he testified that he could not recall whether he had ever even seen the document 
    prior to the date of his deposition on April 4, 2001. Id. Shorter testified 
    that she believed these specifications were in effect at the time of her decision 
    to reject the plaintiff's proposed ads, yet it is undisputed that what she 
    actually attached to her fax of January 20, 2000 were the not-as-yet-in-effect 
    1999 bid specifications for the successor contract. See Exhibits L-M. <br>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><a name="7"></a> To 
    the extent that the AIDS Action case suggests that the mere existence of an 
    express policy may be enough to demonstrate an intent not to create a public 
    forum, the great weight of authority indicates that the analysis is not so 
    broad as the First Circuit suggested. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit observed 
    that the First Circuit seems to stand alone in its reasoning on this point. 
    See Air Line Pilots, 45 F.3d at 1153-54 and n. 4 (&quot;&quot;[T]he government's 
    stated policy, without more, is not dispositive with respect to the government's 
    intent in a given forum.&quot;) Accord East Timor, 71 F. Supp. at 345 (&quot;This 
    makes sense: if the government's stated policy that it did not intend a policy 
    of open access was controlling, the government could circumvent what in practice 
    amounts to open access simply by declaring its 'intent' to designate its property 
    a nonpublic forum in order to enable itself to suppress disfavored speech.&quot;) 
    (quoting United Food, 163 F.3d at 353 and citing Gregoire v. Centennial Sch. 
    Dist., 907 F.3d 1366, 1374 (3d Cir. 1990) (&quot;focusing solely on the government's 
    stated policy would effectively eviscerate the public forum doctrine; the 
    scope of First Amendment rights would be determined by the government rather 
    than by the Constitution.&quot;)). These cases are consistent with the First 
    Circuit's simple, but oft-cited rule from an earlier public forum case, Grace 
    Bible Fellowship, Inc. v. Maine Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 5, 941 F.2d 45 (1st 
    Cir. 1991), that in determining whether the government has designated public 
    property a public forum &quot;actual practice speaks louder than words.&quot; 
    Id. at 47. It is that principle that should guide this Court's public forum 
    analysis.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><a name="8"></a> Although 
    the First Circuit declined to rule on this basis alone in AIDS Action, this 
    undisputed fact is a matter of public record. See 42 F.3d at 2 (&quot;[T]he 
    MBTA regularly authorizes the posting of commercial and public service advertisements 
    in the spaces above its car windows and doors. The MBTA, in conjunction with 
    PTD, has accepted and continues to accept public service advertisements on 
    a wide variety of topics.&quot;). Id.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><a name="9"></a> In 
    the interest of completeness, the plaintiff points out - but with a note of 
    caution to the Court - that the East Timor Court and a few others have classified 
    and analyzed as a subcategory of the designated public forum doctrine a &quot;limited 
    public forum.&quot; 71 Supp.2d at 344, 347. While the plaintiff is confident 
    it would prevail as soundly under this analysis, just as the plaintiff in 
    East Timor prevailed, the First Circuit has not yet adopted the limited public 
    forum analysis, and the plaintiff urges that this Court stay that course. 
    The plaintiff suggests that the limited public forum analysis has the potential 
    to eviscerate the designated public forum doctrine, namely, the fundamental 
    rule that in regulating public access to a designated public forum the government 
    is bound by the same First Amendment standards as bind the government's ability 
    to regulate access to the traditional public forum. See Perry 460 U.S. at 
    46. If anything, courts should be reevaluating the traditional public forum 
    doctrine to include transit authorities and other contemporary media. See 
    generally Cass R. Sunstein, Free Speech Now, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 255, 295 (1992); 
    Owen M. Fiss, Silence On The Street Corner, 26 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 1 (1992) 
    Paul G. Stern, &quot;A Pluralistic Reading Of The First Amendment And Its 
    Relation To Public Discourse,&quot; 99 Yale L.J. 925 (1990). Many have criticized 
    the advent of the &quot;limited&quot; public forum analysis, and rightly so. 
    See, e.g., Robert C. Post, Between Governance and Management: The History 
    And Theory Of The Public Forum, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1713, 1757 (1987) (&quot;If 
    the reach of the forum is determined by the intent of the government, and 
    if the exclusion of the plaintiff is the best evidence of that intent, then 
    the plaintiff loses in every case. There is only one way out of this vicious 
    circle, and it is not very satisfactory. It would require the Court to distinguish 
    between the intent to include the class of speakers or subjects of which the 
    plaintiff is the representative, and the intent to exclude the plaintiff. 
    One problem with this distinction is that it is precious and in practice unworkable.&quot;);

    she answered &quot;no,&quot; because &quot;drinking alcohol does not - drinking 
    alcohol is not a criminal act,&quot; testimony that frankly defies common

    First Amendment rights by refusing to issue vanity license plate reading &quot;ARYAN-1&quot; 
    based on vague regulation prohibiting plates that are &quot;inflammatory or

  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> In light of the record 
    evidence in this case, it cannot be disputed that nature of the MBTA's advertising 
    space is compatible with expressive activity and that the MBTA has promulgated 
    policies without reference to the purpose of the forum, thereby satisfying 
    the second element of the public forum analysis required under Cornelius. 
    473 U.S. at 802-03. Any post-hoc reasons for the defendants' restriction of 
    the plaintiff's access to the forum should be disregarded as a matter of law. 
    See, e.g., Planned Parenthood, 767 F.2d at 1233 (holding transit authority 
    estopped from arguing that public-issue advertising was incompatible with 
    the primary use of the advertising space in light of demonstrated practice 
    to allow public-issue and political advertising.). <br>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> The First Circuit's 
    reasoning in AIDS Action rejecting a suggestion that the restrictions are 
    a &quot;reasonable manner&quot; restriction applies with equal force here. 
    See AIDS Action, 42 F.3d at 26 (&quot;Although it might be reasonable, in 
    an analytical vacuum, to characterize a prohibition on the use of sexually 
    explicit or patently offensive language to communicate an idea as a limitation 
    on the &quot;manner&quot; in which a speaker may speak, such a characterization 
    flies in the face of how the Supreme Court has construed the concept of manner 
    through case-by-case adjudication.&quot;) (citations omitted). To reiterate 
    the obvious, the restrictions at issue here do not meet the &quot;overarching 
    requirement&quot; of content-neutrality. Id. Furthermore, standards purporting 
    to restrict that which is &quot;disreputable&quot; or &quot;harmful to juveniles&quot; 
    are not only content-based, but as applied to political speech, viewpoint-based 
    per se. (See pp. 30-32 infra.). The First Circuit's decision in Jews for Jesus, 
    984 F.2d at 1327, is instructive on that point as well. In that case, the 
    First Circuit found MBTA Guidelines governing the authorization of noncommercial 
    expressive activity to incorporate adequate procedural safeguards, including, 
    among other things, a regulatory appeal process. It was in light of these 
    procedural safeguards that the court analyzed the restrictions as a time, 
    place and manner regulation, taking pains to emphasize that the guidelines 
    are enforced &quot;without regard to the messages presented,&quot; indeed, 
    [t]he Authority does not even inquire about the content of the message.&quot; 
    Id. In the present case, by polar contrast, it is undisputed that Albertelli 
    screened Change the Climate's advertising campaign for review precisely because 
    of her perception of its provocative nature, and defendant Shorter likewise 
    rejected the campaign without any consideration of the plaintiff's First Amendment 
    rights because she disagreed with the organization's &quot;mission.&quot; 
    The MBTA's purported policies are just what the First Circuit warned against 
    in Jews for Jesus: policies &quot;open to the kind of arbitrary application 
    that [the Supreme Court] has condemned as inherently inconsistent with a valid 
    time, place, and manner regulation because such discretion has the potential 
    for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.&quot; Id.

  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> Significantly, in 
    finding for the plaintiffs, the court was unpersuaded by the pair of empirical 
    studies by psychologists that found that playing violent video games tend 
    to make children more aggressive. Id. at 579. The court recognized that whatever 
    the studies tended to show, they certainly did not prove that video games 
    have ever actually caused anyone to commit a violent act. Id. The plaintiff 
    suggests that whatever opinion the defendants' experts may offer in this case 
    (and neither expert has conducted any studies of his own), this Court should 
    likewise recognize that anything short of evidence proving that childrens' 
    exposure to Change the Climate's advertisements will cause them to smoke marijuana 
    (indeed, to immediately smoke marijuana) to be insufficient to show actual 
    harm as a matter of law. The plaintiff suggests that here, even more so than 
    in American Amusement, &quot;common sense&quot; dictates that the government's 
    claim of potential harm to children &quot;is implausible, at best wildly speculative.&quot; 
    Id.; see also Eclipse Enterprises, Inc., 134 F.3d at 68 (criticizing conclusory 
    expert testimony concerning the alleged harmful effects of crime trading cards 
    on children, noting that none of the experts knew of any studies or actual 
    occurrences where crime trading cards were determined to be a factor in juvenile 
    violence or otherwise linked to juvenile crimes). <br>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> The Court held in 
    Rosenberger that the University of Virginia could not withhold funding for 
    the printing costs of a student publication, deemed a limited public forum, 
    based solely on its religious perspective. Rosenberger 515 U.S. at 830-31. 
    It reasoned that the University had not attempted to exclude religion as a 
    general subject matter (content discrimination), but rather had excluded all 
    publications with a religious viewpoint (viewpoint discrimination). Id. at 
    831. Similarly, in Lamb's Chapel the Court struck down a school policy allowing 
    after-hours use of school property for social, civic, or recreational uses 
    or use by political organizations, but barring use by any group for religious 
    purposes. 508 U.S.at 387. The plaintiff was denied permission to use the school 
    in order to show a six-part film series on child rearing and family values, 
    presented from a Christian perspective. Id. at 388-89. The Court found that 
    the subject matter of the film was otherwise permissible under the school's 
    policy, and held that exclusion of the group was therefore based solely on 
    the religious perspective of the film, constituting viewpoint discrimination. 
    Id. at 393-94.<br>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"> To the extent the 
    defendants assert that the February 1993 policy applied to restrict Change 
    the Climate's speech, the First Circuit declared this policy &quot;impossible 
    to understand&quot; and one that invited the very discrimination that occurred 
    in that case. AIDS Action, 42 F.3d at 36-38 (&quot;We think that the opportunities 
    for discrimination created by this Policy have been borne out in practice, 
    and that this case presents an unrebutted claim of discrimination in the application 
    of supposedly neutral standards.&quot;) <br>
