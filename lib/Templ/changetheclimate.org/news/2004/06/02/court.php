  District Court Judge Paul Friedman ruled in favor of Change the Climate, the 
  ACLU, MPP, and DPA in their free speech court case brought against the Bush 
  Administration. As you probably remember, our most recent and very provocative 
  <a href="../../../../campaigns/08_03_dc/">advertising campaign in Washington 
  D.C.</a> sparked a controversy in Washington D.C. and led to the <a href="../../../../campaigns/02_18_04/">passage 
  of a bill that effectively prohibited the type of advertising that we do.</a></font></p>
