<p><b><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="+1">Marijuana and Sex: 
  A Classic Combination</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">by Terry Necco (01 Sept, 
  1998) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Ancient tantrists 
  and modern researchers agree: pot and sex are two great things that go together.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Marijuana and sex are 
  gifts of nature. We enjoy them because biology and evolution have equipped us 
  to do so. Just as our bodies contain pleasure systems which reward us for sex; 
  our brains contain neurocellular circuitry which can only be activated by substances 
  with THC's molecular structure. This makes the marijuana high a unique constellation 
  of feelings, and there are only two sources for the substances which activate 
  THC's very own neuroreceptor. Our brain is one source: it generates a neurochemical 
  very similar to THC, called anandamide. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Translated, the word 
  means bliss. The only other source for this bliss-producing substance is the 
  cannabis plant. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Being stoned or sexually 
  aroused both produce similar physiological responses, such as increased heart 
  rate, heightened sensitivity, changes in blood flow and respiration, relaxation 
  &#150; an acutely altered state of consciousness. Neurochemistry, hormonal systems, 
  and brain regions such as the temporal lobe are affected by both marijuana and 
  sexual arousal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Sex and pot provide us 
  with euphoric peak experiences, unity of body and mind, a healing escape from 
  routine existence. If other people are involved with us in sexual activity or 
  marijuana use, such experiences can be especially intimate and revelatory, facilitating 
  trusting, loving relationships.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Pot the aphrodesiac</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Marijuana has been used 
  as an aphrodisiac for thousands of years, yet ironically it has also been used 
  to decrease sexual desire. Ancient sacred texts reveal how to use marijuana 
  to increase sexual pleasure, but modern research teaches an equally important 
  lesson: marijuana's effects are determined by the personality, physiology, intention, 
  environment, and culture of the user.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Ancient India</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The culture of ancient 
  India is closely associated with sexual marijuana use. Cannabis has been used 
  in India for at least 3,000 years, probably much longer. The Indian Ayurvedic 
  and Unani Tibbi medicine systems used cannabis to increase libido, conquer impotence, 
  and cure various diseases. These systems also utilized opium, sometimes in combination 
  with cannabis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Dozens of formulations 
  containing cannabis were prescribed as aphrodisiacs. Their names are delicious: 
  shrimadananda modaka, uttama vajikarana, majun falaskari, roghan bhang, among 
  others. These formulations were reputed to produce long-lasting erections, delay 
  ejaculation, facilitate lubrication and loosen inhibitions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Tantra</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Sexual cannabis use which 
  transcended hedonism and medicine rose up in an esoteric Hindu-Buddhist tradition 
  known as Tantra, a mystical religion which prescribes physical and mental exercises 
  like meditation and yoga. These practices are intended to help the practicioner 
  escape suffering and achieve enlightenment and perfection, known as Nirvana.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Advanced Tantra marijuana 
  rituals were intense, complex and difficult. Researchers have uncovered sacred 
  texts describing cannabis rituals, but doubt that modern Tantra practitioners 
  still engage in such activities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Modern Tantra has, like 
  many other indigenous spiritual practices, been co-opted by people with little 
  connection to the cultures, communities and environments from which the religions 
  arose. Modern Tantra, though an important source of sexual and spiritual enlightenment, 
  scarcely resembles the hard-core Tantra described in sacred writings like the 
  Mahanirvana Tantra, which was composed in the 11th century AD.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Tantra practitioners 
  believe that human bodies contain energy systems consisting of nerves, heart 
  and spiritual elements that are linked to cosmic and nature-based energies. 
  Males and females have differing degrees and types of energy; and yogic sexual 
  practices unite these energies, creating &quot;circuits&quot; which allow participants 
  to find new heights of intimacy and to transcend egocentric consciousness, helping 
  them realize their timeless place in the universe. Tantric union of male and 
  female energies is thought to facilitate universal balance and to atone for 
  human sins against nature and the cosmos.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Tantra cannabis rituals 
  date back at least to 700 AD, and involved groups of &quot;purified&quot; male 
  and female worshippers who engaged in fasting, chanting, prayer, ceremonial 
  purifications, Kundalini yoga, and sexual union, subjecting body and spirit 
  to excruciating and ecstatic ordeals. Concentration, consecration and transformation 
  were the goals of such rituals, which were conducted in temples festooned with 
  thousands of flowers, clouds of incense smoke, and flickering temple lamps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Bhang</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Tantra practitioners 
  didn't smoke pot &#150; they made an orally ingested cannabis preparation called 
  bhang. Sometimes the bhang was nothing more than a green ball of cannabis mixed 
  with milk, but it could also be a delicious marijuana milkshake made from prime 
  resin-laden cannabis flowers and leaves, mixed with milk, sugar, pepper, almonds, 
  cardamom, poppy seeds, ginger and other herbs. These preparations were heated 
  before serving to allow fat-soluble THC the opportunity to catalyze into a pyschoactive 
  form effective on humans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Bhang made from such 
  recipes is similar to chai, but sweeter and thicker, seasoned by the unmistakable 
  taste of cannabis. Even in modern India, bhang is considered a sacred medicinal 
  drink which cures illness, brings good luck, wards off evil spirits and cleanses 
  people of sins.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">After fasting and purging 
  for at least 24 hours, Tantric celebrants ingested bhang, accompanied by deep 
  abdominal breathing and visual imaging exercises. These exercises free blocked 
  energy, tonify muscles and blood flow, and facilitate the power and onset of 
  cannabis intoxication, which usually occurs within an hour of swallowing the 
  spicy, potent libation.<br>
  Practitioners often experienced initial queasiness from the bhang, which is 
  medicinally active as a digestive tract purgative. As the brew's psychoactive 
  effects become pronounced, practitioners enter a meditative state in which they 
  reaffirm earlier vows which sanctify and praise Kali, the Tantric-Hindu goddess 
  embodying feminine creative forces.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Ritual worship of 
  beauty</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Enshrinement of feminine 
  beauty and energy continues: males ritually bathe and sanctify their female 
  partners, washing them with holy water, scenting and combing their hair, perfuming 
  them, and arranging them on a silken bed. Males then perform a programmed ritual 
  in which they touch the woman's forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, arms and thighs, 
  finally touching the vagina itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The two overtly sexual 
  acts which take place during cannabis rituals are intercourse and the performance 
  of oral sex on the female by the male. During sex, the partners focus on religious 
  symbolism, the mingling of energies and the liberating nature of sexuality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Tantric ritual seeks 
  to prolong sexual union as long as possible. Males and females use yogic breathing, 
  meditation and neuromuscular control to achieve &quot;endless orgasms&quot; 
  without ejaculation or other tiring release. Sacred texts describe cannabis-assisted 
  intercourse lasting for seven or eight hours, until a glow of fire envelops 
  the lovers in total-body orgasms, which result in erasure of mental ideations 
  and ego &#150; the timeless freedom from self which equals Nirvana.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Other cultures' pot-sex</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The Indian uses of Tantra 
  and marijuana are probably the most beautiful and moving interactions between 
  sexuality and cannabis, but other cultures also have sexual cannabis lore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Folk medicines in 19th 
  century Serbia relied on cannabis preparations, which they called nasha. Female 
  virgins were given mixtures of lamb's fat and cannabis on their wedding nights, 
  to decrease the pain of their first intercourse. Such use echoes modern practices 
  in India, where newlyweds drink bhang beverages and eat bhang candy. Indian 
  prostitutes are reported to eat lots of bhang sherbet, which helps them feel 
  sexually aroused even when their customers are fat, ugly and stupid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Serbian women mixed cannabis 
  with egg whites, saffron and sugar to make guc-kand, a tonic which created a 
  sexy mood or (ironically) was given to young boys to lessen the pain of circumcision! 
  Cannabis tonics were also given to crying and pouty children, and it was reported 
  to perk them right up into the smile zone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Serbian men valued a 
  mixture made from potent hashish, almond butter, dried rose leaves, carnation 
  petals, crocus, muscut nut, cardamom, honey, sugar, and Anacylius pyrethrum 
  root. They considered this &quot;happy porridge&quot; a super aphrodisiac.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon 
  and other Middle Eastern and Northern African cultures utilized cannabis for 
  sexual purposes as recently as the early 20th century. There, cannabis was usually 
  encountered in a particularly potent form called kif. Wives and concubinese 
  procured kif from servants and used it when men were not around, often engaging 
  in erotic fantasies and play. Cannabis had the reputation of allowing women 
  to become sexually uninhibited, which was an especially important benefit in 
  cultures where they were routinely oppressed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Contemporary Cannabis 
  Sexuality</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">In countries such as 
  Canada and the United States, interactions between cannabis and sexuality is 
  complicated by gender politics, Puritanism, laws and the stresses of industrial 
  living. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">A few research articles 
  and books provide useful information about cannabis and sex. These researchers 
  concluded that people who enjoy marijuana tend to enjoy sex, and (surprise!) 
  that marijuana and sex can be a powerful combination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">A majority of users reported 
  that they got hornier when they were stoned, but explained that increased lust 
  occurred in situations where a person would normally have felt sexy. Users said 
  that not only was desire increased, their ability to appreciate sexual pleasure 
  was enhanced when they were high.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Less is more</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Intoxication levels influence 
  marijuana's effects on sex. At low to moderate levels of intoxication, users 
  reported heightened ability to communicate sexually with their partners, and 
  increased body awareness. Some users reported that being &quot;very stoned&quot; 
  tended to make them introspective and withdrawn; the marijuana high overwhelmed 
  the user and displaced sexual activity. Others said that when they were extremely 
  high they lost kinesthetic connection with their bodies and were unable to perform 
  sexually because their consciousness was high above the physical realm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">When marijuana dosage 
  was appropriate, however, users reported that it increased sexual stamina and 
  skill, tactile sensation, length and power of orgasms, and emotional bonding 
  between partners. People felt they became more loving, more willing to pay attention 
  to the technical aspects of lovemaking and foreplay which women complain is 
  often missing from male sexual repertoire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Many men reported that 
  their erections were bigger and harder when they were high; women felt that 
  they became wetter, and more able and willing to contract vaginal muscles to 
  maximize sensation for the male. Stoners of both sexes said that being high 
  sometimes allowed them to acknowledge erotic feelings for people whom they had 
  formerly considered as &quot;just friends.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Some women said that 
  they were sexually blocked when unstoned but easily became sexually aroused 
  while high. Some women reported that only when high were they able to achieve 
  orgasm, other women said being stoned helped them achieve multiple orgasms. 
  For both sexes, orgasms were likely to be felt in the entire body, rather than 
  confined to the genital area. Stoned sexers became more aware of cues leading 
  to orgasm and felt freer to engage in body movements which increased pleasure. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Modern users reported 
  spiritual, emotional and psychological effects that mirrored ancient Tantric 
  effects. While high, they felt that intercourse was an exchange of energies 
  which united their bodies in a cosmic circuit. They felt that this exchange 
  was replenishing and balancing, and that orgasm was an energizing climax to 
  sex, instead of a draining finale.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Some respondents said 
  that sex while high lifted them past ego into spiritual realms, where the sex 
  act took on symbolic and universal importance. Many also noted that marijuana 
  seemed to help them feel more love for their partners, and more gratitude for 
  sexual function as a means of communicating &quot;far more powerful than words 
  or other actions could ever be.&quot; <br>
  Marijuana users experienced in yoga and meditation felt that marijuana increased 
  their awareness of inner organs and subtle internal processes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Love Mechanisms</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Although nobody has identified 
  the mechanisms which account for marijuana's apparent usefulness as an aphrodisiac, 
  the drug's reputation as a sensory enhancer and emotional revealer probably 
  account for much of the effect. Marijuana users report that being high usually 
  increases temperature perception, taste, touch, visual stimulation, body awareness, 
  musical-auditory enjoyment, fantasy production, and mood. Other common effects 
  include changes in time perception which often lead to a feeling that time has 
  slowed down so more information is being processed and felt. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Ironically, these same 
  effects have been cited by people who feel that marijuana interferes with enjoyment 
  of sex. Indeed, ascetics, monks and others have used marijuana to free themselves 
  of sexual desire. For them, the drug produces introspection and detachment. 
  Instead of connecting them to their bodies, sexual desires, or other people, 
  it helps them dwell meditatively on abstract mental concepts, on religious goals, 
  or even on nothing at all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Some couples reported 
  that being high made them more aware of flaws in their relationships, which 
  did little to put them in the mood for lovemaking! Others said being stoned 
  increased non-sexual ideas which distracted them from their bodies and their 
  partners, and made sex more difficult. One couple said that while making love 
  stoned their minds wandered &#150; they found it more interesting to discuss 
  the meaning of life than to continue lovemaking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>Solo &amp; Homo</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">You've probably noticed 
  that the marijuana-sex research reported here focusses on heterosexuality and 
  fails to mention masturbation or homosexuality. Specific research into cannabis 
  and homosexual sex is virtually non-existent. The few studies that mention marijuana 
  and masturbation indicate that being high tends to increase masturbatory pleasure 
  because it enhances tactile inputs and fantasy creation. People who like to 
  use cannabis alone also tend to like to have sex alone, with themselves!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Some studies reveal stereotypical 
  gender differences: women tend to be more conservative than men in their use 
  of marijuana to enhance sexual pleasure and in ability to give up control and 
  enjoy a drug-induced state of intensely heightened sexual arousal. One woman 
  complained to researchers that being high had caused her to &quot;have sex with 
  a man I didn't love.&quot; Another said she was afraid of cannabis because it 
  made her &quot;have sex just for the sake of the pleasure instead of in a monogamous 
  relationship.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The &quot;typical&quot; 
  male attitude toward sex can be seen in the statements from a man who said &quot;There's 
  that joke about women needing a reason to have sex but men just need an opportunity. 
  I have sex because I love the sensation, I love the woman's body, I love to 
  see her orgasm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">It's the same reason 
  I get high &#150; I'm a hungry hedonist. But I think women have sex for a whole 
  bunch of other reasons. It's very hard for them to have sex just because it 
  feels good, and I think that being high can upset them because they get looser 
  than they want to be. They realize that a skilled lover, even somebody they've 
  just met, can get them off if they let themselves be open to it. They've been 
  told that they have to be in love in a committed relationship for sex to be 
  honorable and great, but cannabis turns them on to the fact that no they don't, 
  they just have to be open to good feelings.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Contrary to the reefer 
  madness myth that marijuana automatically causes uncontrollable sexual desire, 
  we see that although cannabis and sexuality have been closely related for thousands 
  of years, each of us has a unique set of psychosexual parameters which determine 
  whether marijuana will magnify or decrease sexual desire and enjoyment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>A smoking relationship</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">An anthropologist notes 
  that cannabis religions recognize the metaphysical potential of the female cannabis 
  plant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Cultures with sacred 
  cannabis use tend to be cultures which recognize the 'goddess'. That could mean 
  mother earth, yin, or female beauty and virtues. People who bring marijuana 
  inside themselves are engaging in a type of sexual union with the plant. It 
  is a very sexual act to have a molecule of THC implant itself into your brain.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">&quot;Since cannabis 
  is associated with female dieties like Kali, we could say that when you use 
  marijuana sexually, you are bringing a very special 'woman' into your bed. Make 
  sure you're ready for that relationship.&quot;</font></p>
