BOSTON (AP)   For the fifth time in three decades, the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority has been challenged over
the agency's decisions as to which ads to allow on MBTA property.
<p>   On Friday, the MBTA returned to federal court, this time
defending its right to refuse ads questioning marijuana laws, the
first time that an advertiser's challenge to MBTA ad policy has
gone to trial.
<p>   For the courts, the lawsuit brought by the drug law reform group
Change the Climate poses a relatively straightforward First
Amendment question: Do free speech protections apply to
advertisers?
<p>   But the fight reveals something more than just the legal
interpretation of free speech, some say.
<p>   ''Let's face it, Boston is a different kind of city, for good or
for bad,'' Boston College historian and author Thomas H. O'Connor
told The Boston Globe. ''After all, it was Puritans that founded
Boston.''
<p>   New York rarely fights risque advertisers on its transit system
and Washington, D.C., has virtually halted any attempt to regulate
political ads on its buses and subways, but Boston still bans ads
at a rate of about two a year, officials say.
<p>   MBTA spokeswoman Lydia Rivera said ''other cities can do what
they want,'' but transportation officials will go to court as often
as it takes to defend the authority's decisions of what is
acceptable.
<p>   ''If we have to continuously go into court to try and let them
know that some advertisements are unacceptable on our system, we
will continue to do that,'' she said.
<p>   Change the Climate, founded by Greenfield resident Joe White,
wanted to run three ads on the MBTA that question existing drug
laws. One reads, ''Police are too important, too valuable, too
good, to waste on arresting people for marijuana when real
criminals are on the loose.''
<p>   The MBTA rejected those ads last year, claiming they encouraged
children to smoke marijuana.
<p>   In his opening statement Friday, MBTA attorney Robert A.
Bertsche said the MBTA has the right to protect riders from
offensive or illegal messages.
<p>   ''The T would not run an ad saying, 'Shoplifting is not cool,
you know, but grand larceny is a lot worse,''' Bertsche said. ''It
wouldn't run an ad saying, 'Police are too important to waste on
arresting people for date rape when real criminals are on the
loose.'''
<p>   The ads ran twice on the Washington transit system last year,
displayed inside and outside buses, and in 10 metro rail stations.
<p>   ''We usually tend to run the ads that might be a little
questionable because the board believes very strongly in First
Amendment rights,'' said Lisa Farbstein, a spokeswoman for the
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
<p>   In 1984, Farbstein said, the authority tried to block an ad
mocking President Ronald Reagan as leader of ''The Jelly Bean
Republic.'' The authority lost and has since hesitated to interfere
with ads.
<p>   Harvey Schwartz, the attorney representing Change the Climate,
said that if some group's messages are allowed, others must have
the chance to do the same.
<p>   ''They can't pick and choose what viewpoints they'll allow,''
Schwartz said.
<p>   The MBTA currently bans ads that are obscene, violent, harmful
to children, or denigrate groups based on gender, religion, race,
or political affiliation.
<p>   Earlier this month, the Church with the Good News also sued the
T over an ad that ran in December, but was later pulled, which
said, ''Christians in the Bible never observed Christmas. Neither
did they believe in lies about Santa Claus, flying reindeer, elves,
and drunken parties.''
<p>   Since 1974, the MBTA has lost three federal suits brought by
advertisers.
<p>   The MBTA couldn't say how much it has spent defending such
lawsuits.
