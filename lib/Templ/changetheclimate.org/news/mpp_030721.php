  government's war on medical marijuana</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">If you take two minutes 
  now to contact your U.S. House member, you will play an important part in ending 
  the DEA's raids and the federal government's war on medical marijuana patients 
  and providers. Like never before, the Marijuana Policy Project needs you to 
  take action now.</font></P>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">On Wednesday or Thursday 
  of this week, the full U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on 
  the issue of medical marijuana the first time in five years!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">U.S. Reps. Maurice Hinchey 
  (D-NY) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), with the support of Reps. Ron Paul (R-TX), 
  Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and many other House members, are planning to propose 
  a medical marijuana amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. 
  Quite simply, the amendment would prevent the DEA and the Justice Department 
  from spending any money to investigate or raid medical marijuana patients and 
  providers in the states where medical marijuana is legal. It is urgent that 
  you let your U.S. representative know -- today or Tuesday -- that you want him 
  or her to vote for the Hinchey/Rohrabacher amendment. Here's how:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>FAX ...</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">The easiest thing to 
  do is to fax your U.S. representative a pre-written letter from our Web site 
  at <a href="http://www.mpp.org/DefundDEA/" target="_blank">www.mpp.org/DefundDEA</a> 
  . The entire process takes only two minutes. After you enter your address, you 
  will see links to a selection of sample letters; please choose a letter, edit 
  it if you like, and then fax it to your U.S. representative with one final click.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">If you are feeling inspired, 
  we strongly encourage you to personalize your letter. (But whatever you do, 
  please make sure that the letter clearly asks your U.S. representative to vote 
  for the Hinchey/Rohrabacher medical marijuana amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State 
  Appropriations bill on the House floor.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1"><b>PHONE ...</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">You can also call your 
  U.S. representative's office through the Capitol switchboard. If you don't know 
  the name of your U.S. representative, you can give the switchboard operator 
  your city or zip code and he or she will connect you to your U.S. representative's</font></p>
