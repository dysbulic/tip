teenager funding international terrorism? If he does drugs, yes. That's the new 
message from the federal government broadcast in Super Bowl ads last night. Is 
it fair? We'll ask the head of the DEA. Back in a moment.<BR>
<BR>
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)<BR>
<BR>
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<BR>
<BR>
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I help blow up buildings.<BR>
<BR>
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My life, my body. <BR>
<BR>
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not like I was hurting anybody else. <BR>

(END VIDEO CLIP)<BR>
<BR>
CARLSON: That's what tens of millions of football watchers saw last night when 
the Super Bowl went to a commercial break, new ads produced by the White House 
Office of National Drug Control Policy. It cost $3.5 million to run.<BR>
<BR>
It's implication is clear. If you do drugs, you're supporting terrorism. It's 
a message sure to resonate with a nation fighting terror at home and abroad. But 
is it accurate? Are low level users really funding the bin Ladens of the world? 
Or is the message merely heavy handed propaganda?<BR>
<BR>
A smoking debate tonight. Joining us, Asa Hutchinson, head of the Federal Drug 
Enforcement Administration and Keith Stroup, founder of the National Organization 
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws -- Bill Press. <BR>
<BR>
PRESS: Keith Stroup, I know you know I'm no fan of the war on drugs. But let me 
talk to you about this ad. If your goal is to reach the largest possible audience, 
particularly to reach young people and others who might be customers or potential 
buyers of drugs, you want to get out a tough message. You want to get the most 
bang for your buck, right, in television.<BR>
<BR>
Now other than advertising on CROSSFIRE, of course, wouldn't you say that the 
Super Bowl is a place to spend your money and this was money well spent? <BR>
<BR>
KEVIN STROUP, NORML FOUNDATION: If it were true, if it were a campaign based on 
facts and science, I might agree with you. But in fact, I think it was a colossal 
waste of taxpayer money. Is there anyone who truly believes that illicit drug 
use patterns in this country are affected even in the slightest way by government 
propaganda?<BR>
<BR>
If they were, frankly, after 65 years of reform ads of this government propaganda, 
there wouldn't be any marijuana smokers left. And think for a second what we could 
have used that money for to pay Headstart programs or textbooks or women who need 
prenatal care.<BR>
<BR>
Secondly it is absolutely inaccurate, considering 65 percent or two out of three 
of all illicit drug users in this country are simply marijuana smokers. Well, 
marijuana is primarily grown in the United States. It's homegrown. And that that 
is imported comes from Canada, from Mexico and from Jamaica. Those are not terrorist 
countries, Bill. <BR>
<BR>
PRESS: But I think you missed the entire point of the ads, which was that the 
connection between drug money and terrorism. You know, the Justice Department 
has said that 14 of the 28 organizations identified as terrorist organizations, 
which are active in this country, are funded by illegal drug sales. So you may 
not know it, but when you're buying the joint, aren't you in fact perhaps supporting 
a terrorist organization?<BR>
<BR>
That was the message. Speak to that. <BR>
<BR>
STROUP: But that is my point. That is an inaccurate premise. When you buy marijuana, 
you are either supporting someone who grows it in this country or in Canada or 
Mexico or maybe Jamaica. Those are not terrorist supporting countries.<BR>
<BR>
It's as if you blame beer drinkers during the 1920's for the violence associated 
with Al Capone. It is -- this campaign is really an attempt to demonize drug users. 
And they do it by trying to piggyback an unpopular program, the war on drugs. 
74 percent of the American public say it's a failure. They're trying to piggyback 
it on a more popular program. And in so doing, they are in fact demonizing drug 
users. So they don't have -- real quickly, so they don't have to justify whether 
these laws do more harm than good. <BR>
<BR>
CARLSON: OK, now director Hutchinson, I'm not for legalization. But I have to 
say I think these spots are a waste of $3.5 million. So you know, you're the average 
11th grade dope smoker. And you see this on television. And you think, they've 
told me that drugs fry my brain. They told me that, you know, drugs are bad for 
my health, that drugs are bad for America. Now they're saying that drugs help 
terrorism. It's going to be laughed right off the set. They're not going to take 
this seriously, your target audience. <BR>
<BR>
ASA HUTCHINSON, DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATOR: Well, I think the fact that we're 
here debating this issue shows that the ads work. The whole design of an ad during 
a Super Bowl campaign is to provoke and debate in America. Here, certainly, the 
ads were factual because it said that using drugs might support terrorism.<BR>
<BR>
Secondly, they're provocative, create a debate. If it causes one parent and one 
teen to have a discussion about drug use, then I think it's certainly worth it. 
Obviously the ads are the beginning of a campaign that John Walters, OMDCP, is 
putting forth. It's going to have more ads, more debate on this.<BR>
<BR>
We had a symposium at the DEA, talking about the historic link between terrorism 
and drugs. And that linkage is clear from history. It is very, very current. And 
America understands that. And it could be a helpful means for parents to show 
the risk, to discourage drug use.<BR>
<BR>
CARLSON: Now I -- you know, this is no slur on John Walters, a terrific guy, very 
smart, very capable person. But the ad itself is ludicrously overdrawn. And I 
hope you'll agree. Look, if I said everybody who buys goods made in China, and 
virtually everyone buys goods made in China, is responsible for the totalitarianism 
in China, or for slave labor, or for their policies towards inmates, you would 
say well that's not fair. The average consumer isn't responsible for those policies. 
The Chinese are.<BR>
<BR>
Terrorists are responsible for terrorism. Dope smokers are responsible for smoking 
dope. <BR>
<BR>
HUTCHINSON: Terrorists are responsible for terrorism. But at the same time, we 
have to look at where they get their money. We don't speak in absolutist terms. 
The ad refers to might support terrorism. The whole idea is to cause a young person 
or anyone who uses drugs, to think, think about not only the damage to yourself, 
the fact that it's illegal, the consequences of it, but also the linkages.<BR>
<BR>
Whether you talk about the Middle East, Colombia with the (UNINTELLIGIBLE), whether 
you're talking about southeast Asia, you are looking at historic links with terrorism. 
And in fact, the 20 some groups on the State Department's terrorist organization 
list, almost half of them are linkages to drug use. So it's something we have 
to think about. <BR>
<BR>
PRESS: Well, let's get into this war on drugs here. Keith, I want to get you back 
in just a second. I got to turn to the director here, because I'm really glad 
you're in the position you are. Because I know what a conservative you are. And 
I know as a conservative, you're opposed to great big, bloated government programs 
that cost a lot of money and don't work.<BR>
<BR>
Asa Hutchinson, we've been at this drug wear since 1980. And Nancy Reagan said, 
"Just say no." We spend billions and billions of dollars on it. The same amount 
of drugs are coming into this country. People are still using them. There are 
new drugs on the market. Big articles in the papers about it this weekend. Are 
you ready as a conservative to say here it is. One, big bloated government program, 
cost a lot of money, doesn't work, pull the plug, make history. <BR>
<BR>
HUTCHINSON: Let me it answer it this way with the survey on household drug use. 
<BR>
<BR>
PRESS: 74 percent say it doesn't work. <BR>
<BR>
HUTCHINSON: In the last 15 years, there's 9.3 million fewer regular monthly drug 
users. That's 9.3 million fewer users. And so, that's the facts. Those are the 
facts. Certainly we need to make more progress in this. But if we can reduce drug 
use by 9.3 million overall, cocaine use in last 15 years by 75 percent, we're 
making enormous progress. And a lot of it comes because of the ad campaign that 
Congress is funding $192 -- $180 million dollars this year. And we get young people 
where they listen. <BR>
<BR>
CARLSON: Now Keith Stroup, let me just ask you. There's a connection between terrorism 
and drugs. And at least one, and it's come about this way. With all the attention 
on American borders, it turns out a lot more drugs are turning up. In the last 
-- between October and December, twice the amount of cocaine was seized at the 
U.S.-Mexican border as the year before. That's a good thing, isn't it? <BR>
<BR>
STROUP: Well, no, I would not say it's a good thing. I think... <BR>
<BR>
CARLSON: The cocaine should have come in the United States? <BR>
<BR>
STROUP: I think drug prohibition is a failed public policy, regardless of how 
many Super Bowl ads Mr. Hutchinson... <BR>
<BR>
CARLSON: But was it a good idea to seize the cocaine or should it have gone through? 
<BR>
<BR>
STROUP: It's fine to seize the drugs. The mistake is to treat the drug users as 
criminals. They are not. If in fact they have a problem, it's a medical problem. 
We need to provide help.<BR>
<BR>
Prohibition wastes an enormous amount of law enforcement resources that should 
be focused on serious and violent crime. It invites government into areas of our 
private lives that totally inappropriate.<BR>
<BR>
And number three, it's sadly destroys the lives and careers of literally hundreds 
of thousands of genuinely good citizens every year in this country for no good 
reason. <BR>
<BR>
PRESS: Gentlemen, the drug war may not be over, but it's over now at least for 
this part of the show. Keith Stroup, thank you for joining us. Sorry we're out 
of time. Congressman, I still want to call you Asa Hutchinson.<BR>
<BR>
HUTCHINSON: Thank you.<BR>
<BR>
PRESS: Good to have you back on CROSSFIRE.</font><? include($relpath . "right.php"); ?>
