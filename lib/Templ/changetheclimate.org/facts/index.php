                                                  entirely safe, its dangers had been grossly

                                                  research, editors of the British journal Lancet (the
                                                  British equivalent of New England Journal of Medicine)
                                                  concluded that "the smoking of cannabis, even long

<ul>
<li><b>Fact #1</b> Marijuana has been shown to be effective in
                                                  reducing nausea induced by cancer chemotherapy,

<font face="verdana, geneva, tahoma, arial" size="-1">

<ul>
<li><b>Fact #1</b> Marijuana use by kids, like alcohol and
                                                  tobacco, is not OK. Its use is illegal, and the effect of

                                                  not been studied. Common sense tells us that

<b>Myth #4: Marijuana is highly addictive.</b></font><p>

<font face="verdana, geneva, tahoma, arial" size="-1">
<ul>
<li><b>Fact #1</b> Most people who smoke marijuana smoke it
                                                  only occasionally. A small minority of Americans --less

                                                  near-daily basis. An even smaller minority develops
                                                  dependence on marijuana. Marijuana is not physically

<b>Myth #5: Marijuana leads to harder drugs (the "gateway theory").</b></font><p>

<font face="verdana, geneva, tahoma, arial" size="-1">
<ul><li><b>
Fact #1</b> Over 70 million people have tried marijuana.
                                                  Most marijuana users never use any other illegal drug.
                                                  Indeed, for the vast majority of people, marijuana is
                                                  the last drug they try, not a "gateway" to other
                                                  drugs. If it were a gateway drug and if it were so
                                                  addictive, we would have more than 3 million heroin
                                                  and cocaine addicts in the U.S.</li> <p>

                                                  <li><b>Fact #2</b> Marijuana is the most popular illegal drug in
                                                  the United States today. Therefore, people who have
                                                  used less popular drugs such as heroin, cocaine and
                                                  LSD are likely to have also tried marijuana. </li></ul></font>

<b>Myth #6: Marijuana impairs memory and cognition.</b></font><p>

<font face="verdana, geneva, tahoma, arial" size="-1">
<ul><li><b>
Fact #1</b> Marijuana produces immediate, temporary
                                                  changes in thoughts, perceptions, and information
                                                  processing. The cognitive process most clearly
                                                  affected by marijuana is short-term memory. In
                                                  laboratory studies, subjects under the influence of
                                                  marijuana have no trouble remembering things they
                                                  learned previously. However, they display diminished
                                                  capacity to learn and recall new information. This
                                                  diminishment only lasts for the duration of
                                                  intoxication.</li></ul></font>

                                                  majority of marijuana users do not commit crimes.
                                                  Almost all human and animal studies show that
