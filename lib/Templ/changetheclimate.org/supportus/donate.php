<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Change the Climate is 
  a non-profit organization dedicated to telling the truth about marijuana. It 
  is a campaign founded and supported by parents and business professionals to 
  educate the public about the tremendous waste of tax dollars for the &quot;war 
  on marijuana&quot;. Our goal is to tell the truth about marijuana and to &quot;de-demonize&quot; 
  it so that someday politicans will support marijuana reform legislation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">Change the Climate relies 
  on outdoor advertising to educate the public and raise awareness about these 
  important issues. These campaigns are funded and made possible by people like 
  you who make tax deductible gifts to our organization. These funds are pooled 
  and used to fund our advertising campaigns around the country. To date our supporters 
  have made possible <a href="../campaigns/">three outdoor ad campaigns in Washington 
  D.C. and one in Nevada</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial" size="-1">We are asking for your 
  support to make more of these public education and awareness campaigns possible. 
  Become a Change Partner and make a tax deductible gift of $10, $25, $50, or 
  more!</font> </p>
