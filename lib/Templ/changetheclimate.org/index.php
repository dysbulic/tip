<p><font size="-1" face="verdana, geneva, tahoma, arial">If you'd like to &quot;change 
  the climate&quot; around marijuana to keep your kids safe from hard drugs, to 
  save thousands of your tax dollars, and to stop the senseless arrest of millions, 
  then <a href="supportus/">support Change the Climate</a>. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="verdana, geneva, tahoma, arial">It's a campaign, founded 
  by parents and business professionals, to educate the public about the tremendous 
  waste of our tax dollars for the "war on marijuana" and the increasing threat 
  to our basic civil liberties. Our goal is to tell the truth about marijuana 
  -- to de-demonize it -- so that someday, politicians will support marijuana 
  reform legislation. <a href="supportus/">Support us</a> now and help us tell 
  the truth. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="verdana, geneva, tahoma, arial"> Like other drugs, marijuana 
  is NOT for kids. But providing inaccurate information about marijuana in the 
  form of "shock ads" only discredits adults and our efforts to curb marijuana 
  use by young people. Click <a href="kids/">here</a> for ideas on how to talk 
  to your kids about marijuana. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="verdana, geneva, tahoma, arial"> Change the Climate's 
  advertising campaign is an effective way to change attitudes and bring marijuana 
  reform directly to the people -- billboards and banner ads reach different people 
  than NY Times and New Republic ads. Politicians will NOT make any effort to 
  change unjust, wasteful and unconstitutional marijuana laws until it's clear 
  that people are fed up with these laws. Since 1996, medical marijuana initiatives 
  have been passed by a majority of voters in eight states and the District of 
  Columbia -- and no state has ever rejected a medical marijuana initiative. Currently, 
  one in five voters in the U.S. lives in a state where marijuana is legal for 
  medicinal purposes. </font></p>
