<font face="verdana, geneva, tahoma, arial"> <b><font size="+1">Welcome to Change the Climate TV!</font></b> </font> 
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">The FCC would never let Change 
  the Climate have our own bandwidth because they don't want people to hear 
  alternative views about marijuana and current laws. So we've started CTC 
  TV online.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Through funny animations and film 
  shorts we hope to get people talking about our country's crazy marijuana 
  laws. Daily, out-in-the-open discussions about marijuana prohibition is needed 
  before laws can change. This is why we're using popular culture to reach 
  people in ways traditional communications don't.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Every couple of weeks 
  we'll be releasing a new episode, so sign up on our email list and we'll let 
  you know when a new episode of CTC TV is released. Pass these quick and entertaining 
  animations on to your friends and together we can &quot;change the climate&quot; 
  around marijuana &#8211; when we say &#8220;change the climate&#8221; we mean 
  changing the status quo thinking about marijuana. We mean abandon the fear.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Episode 6: &quot;Imagine&quot;</font></strong></p>

  out our latest video by clicking here &#8211; titled &quot;Imagine.&quot;</a></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">I promise you won't regret 
  taking two minutes to experience this beautiful piece. It sums up the tragedy 
  of the war on marijuana like nothing you've seen. I know that sounds like hype, 
  but see it and decide for yourself.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">If you like it, forward 
  it to everyone you know. Let's use it to educate and entertain people about 
  why we should stop this madness.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">So <a href="imagine.html">watch 
  now</a> and be prepared to feel chills.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Episode 5: &quot;POT versus 
  BOOZE!&quot;</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial"><a href="potvbooze.html"><img src="../images/potvbooze.gif" alt="" width="325" height="225" hspace="6" border="0" align="right"></a>My 
  mind continues to be boggled by the huge disparity between laws governing marijuana 
  and alcohol. You would think marijuana was the mass killer, not the other way 
  around.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">This won't last forever, 
  right? </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Change the Climate, with 
  your help, has been doing our part of broaden the debate and educate people 
  on this important issue. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">In Denver, where people 
  voted last November to legalize less than an ounce of marijuana, the advocates 
  of the initiative repeatedly pointed out the insanity of laws favoring alcohol 
  over marijuana. Inspired by the success in Denver, we've created a short animation 
  comparing pot and booze. This was a major topic of debate during the Denver 
  campaign.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">The short cartoon has 
  everything most people love &#8211; food, relaxation, and sex. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">This is the latest in 
  our series of animated cartoons we&#8217;re calling &quot;CTC TV.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">We want people who may 
  not support your typical activist group to sign up with Change the Climate because 
  our advocacy is fun, edgy, and different. Plus with our low overhead, most of 
  the money we raise from people like you pays for advertisements that seek to 
  &quot;change the climate&quot; around marijuana.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Episode 4: &quot;Mayhem 
  in Washington!&quot;</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial"><a href="mayhem.html"><img src="../images/mayhem.gif" alt="" width="325" height="229" hspace="6" border="0" align="right"></a>Yes, 
  it's difficult to picture any brave soul in Congress proposing a rational idea 
  like the legalization and taxation of marijuana.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">&quot;Mayhem&quot; shows explicitly, 
  what would likely occur if the Congressional silence over pot legalization were 
  lifted. Mayhem is not so pretty, but it tries to be funny&#8212;all with the 
  aim of spreading the word that it makes good, practical sense to legalize and 
  tax marijuana.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">This is our latest in 
  the series of CTC animations intended to activate people who might otherwise 
  see politics as a boring waste of time. We're trying to make political involvement 
  fun and meaningful.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Episode 3: &quot;Operation Door-to-Door&quot;</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial"><a href="cops.html"><img src="../images/police-tv-icon.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="215" hspace="6" border="0" align="right"></a>It's easy to parody the war on pot, because the entire endeavor is a parody of itself!</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">The government wastes its time—and our money—trying to stop marijuana in one place and it immediately pops up in another.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Why? Because people love to smoke, and pot smokers are everywhere. And they will not be stopped.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">That's what our latest short animated film "Cops" is all about.</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">
It’s the third in our series of animated offerings aimed at all those people who are turned off by politics, but share our vision of a day when our country has a rational drug policy. We want to united these unrepresented voices and make them a force for the legalization of marijuana.</font></p>

  hope you&#8217;ve had a relaxing summer and are now ready for the 2nd video 
  in<br>
  the series of Change the Climate short animated films focusing on marijuana<br>
  issues. This is part of our goal to reach people who otherwise might ignore<br>
  politics -- we're doing it in a fun, edgy online style.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">This time we tackle the taboo topic 
  of sex and marijuana. (Gasp!) This<br>
  video might not be appropriate to forward to younger folks or family. On<br>
  the other hand, it might just be hilariously true to other people.</font></p>

  Bush Administration's priorities are out of whack &#8211; indeed the entire 
  administration is out of whack! How can you justify spending billions every 
  year arresting small-time marijuana smokers &#8211; including sick patients 
  and caregivers in California &#8211; when the priority is supposed to be homeland 
  security? How can you justify laws that deny student loans to poor kids but 
  make them available to violent felons?</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">Or is life just imitating 
  art (the film &quot;1984&quot;) as we embrace a ubiquitous state of war (Isn't 
  this the War on Terror?) and increased federal intrusion in our personal space 
  &#8211; our homes, our bodies, our sex lives and our medicine. They called it 
  Big Brother.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial">&quot;Operation Overkill&quot; 
  is a humorous look at the Administration's misguided priorities. It wouldn&#8217;t
