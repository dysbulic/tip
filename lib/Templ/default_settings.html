    <h1>Templ Default Settings</h1>

    <p>In designing the <a href=".">Templ</a> CMS, I had three main thoughts going through my mind that I wanted to address:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I'm a web designer. I am comfortable with PHP, javascript, XHTML and XSLT. Other competent designers will be as well and so the underlying page structure can use these elements without a penalty to readability or maintainability.</li>
      <li>I do not want to maintain all the content myself. The people maintaining the content are not web designers. They need something <acronym title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym>.</li>
      <li>At some point someone will ask me to do something I never thought of and which will require a different paradigm than I've structured.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My goal with the system was to have it do something reasonable that would work correctly 90% of the time. Also, to leave things open to configuration at various levels to the extent that whatever changes are needed to fix that last 10% can be done.</p>
    
    <p>The core of the system is <a href="build/api/">HooksProcessor</a>. If this class is invoked with a directory as an argument, it will iterate over each of the files in the directory. For all the files that match load a set of <a href="default.tmpl">default hooks</a>.</p>

    <p>The first of these hooks is <a href="build/api/">org.himinbi.templ.LoadMetadataHook</a>. It takes <code>&lt;tmpl:var name="path"></code> arguments for pathes to load, or if those are missing it loads a default set from the following places:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>~/.templ.metadata</code></li>
      <li><code>.templ.metadata</code> between the original directory and the current directory (directories are processed recursively)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The next hook is&hellip;</p>
