    <h1>The Department of Happiness</h1>
    <h2><a href="mailto:Will%20Holcomb%20%3Cwill@dhappy.org%3E">Will Holcomb</a></h2>
    <h2>2 December 2009</h2>

    <p>The <acronym title="Department of Happiness">DoH</acronym> is a dream a world without war. It remains a dream because I don't know how to make it into anything else. After a year of working on trying to figure out how to move it forward, I'm out of money. I've got $700 left in the bank and I don't even know if that will carry me to the point that I can find a job.</p>

    <p>Even now I don't want to give up. I feel like a blind man who is led to an <a href="http://will.tip.dhappy.org/media/text/John%20Saxe%20-%20The%20Blind%20Men%20and%20the%20Elephant/John%20Saxe%20-%20The%20Blind%20Men%20and%20the%20Elephant.txt" title="The Blind Men and the Elephant">elephant</a> each day and then try to describe piecemeal to people who have never seen an elephant themselves. I know there is <em>something</em> there, and my single greatest barrier is my inability to describe it.</p>

    <p>Such is where I am now &mdash; incoherent and out of money. I'm going to just write down as much as I can as clearly as I can. The best place to start is likely with a bit of background:</p>

    <h2>Agile Development</h2>

    <p>Agile is a management system used in the software industry that developed in response to issues with the complexity of large software projects. Rather than making a single static timeline at the outset and attempting to stick to it, the project is broken up into smaller features and teams focus on short "sprints" to produce the eventual system.</p>

    <p>The agile process starts off with a project scope. This defines the boundaries of the project, for example, I'm getting married in August and I've been considering creating a tool to help me deal with the logistical details. For that project, the scope might be, "an online system for planning a wedding."</p>

    <p>Next that general scope is filled in with an "initial modeling," i.e. brainstorming all the things that the software could potentially do. This includes everything from the obvious, "show an event calendar" and "manage a guest list" to the ambitious "show a graphical seating chart." This is tranditionally done with lots of post-its:</p>

    <div id="postits">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="../blog/2009/12/02/agile_postits.svg" title="Wedding Postits"></object>
    </div>

    <p>Once all the potential features are generated, they are divided into four groups:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Features &mdash; things the program should do</li>
      <li>Whistles &mdash; things it would be nice to have</li>
      <li>Enhancements &mdash; things too difficult to achieve in this version, but which could be included later</li>
      <li>Garbage &mdash; things likely reduce the value of the system in the long term</li>
    </ul>

    <div id="sorted">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="../blog/2009/12/02/sorted_postits.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>Once the modeling is finished, a rough development timeline is created which, depending on the overall length, is broken up into milestones:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Timeline: 5 January 2010 - 30 July 2010
        <ul>
          <li>Milestone #1: January 5 - March 5</li>
          <li>Milestone #2: March 8 - April 23</li>
          <li>Milestone #3: April 25 - June 4</li>
          <li>Milestone #4: June 6 - July 30</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div id="milestones">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="../blog/2009/12/02/milestones.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>Each milestone is then broken up into iterations of 2-4 weeks and features are decomposed into small concrete tasks and distributed through the iterations:</p>

    <div id="projected">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="../blog/2009/12/02/projected_timeline.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>Each iteration is then broken into two sections, a planning stage where team members divy up deliverables and figure out a plan, followed by a sprint where everyone is working to finish the tasks they have taken.</p>

    <div id="iteration">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="../blog/2009/12/02/iteration.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>As each iteration completes, if any tasks were unfinished then they are bumped to a future iteration. The actual features to be handled in each iteration are continually being updated and this flexibility is where the agile process gets its name.</p>

    <div id="iteration">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="../blog/2009/12/02/joined_iterations.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <h2>An Agile Business</h2>

    <p>For the <acronym title="Department of Happiness">DoH</acronym>, I wanted to create a long term project timeline which would lay out a general progression of events. Small agile teams could then collaborate toward meeting the major milestones. Having an overarching narrative would allow teams to work in parallel on projects with different timelines, but still combine their work effectively.</p>

    <p>A long term planning narrative for a technology company is, in essence, identical to a near term speculative science fiction story &mdash; both describe a series of plausible events and accompanying changes in the environment. The <acronym title="Department of Happiness">DoH</acronym> then is the story of the creation of a financial institution that wouldn't be possible without the internet.</p>

    <p><em>This is the point where things start to get tenuous. This project hinges of building public support and involvement which is necessarily an unknown. One of the main goals is to make something interesting and promising enough that people will want to participate.</em></p>

    <p>The plan spans five years and is, at the highest level, broken into six month blocks:</p>

    <div id="five_year">
      <object type="image/svg+xml" data="../blog/2009/12/02/doh_5_year_timeline.svg"></object>
    </div>

    <p>The basic product idea is twofold: one, drive up the amount of information available by generating interest in an agent-mediated distributed graph database and two, create a hybrid human-generated expert system and an agent-based recommendation engine based interface for navigating the data. <em>I need graphs here&hellip;</em></p>

    <p>The first nine months are about the creation of infrastructure &mdash; getting the technical components in place for later stages. The first major release would be at <a href="http://www.burningman.com">Burning Man</a> driving an application called "Down the Rabbit Hole." A site deployed in the months before the event would allow authors to create stories that coincide in some way with the time and space of Burning Man. Specifically, the stories would have a limited information component, such as a conspiracy or a mystery. Camps then, can register to fit themselves into the story.</p>

    <p>For example&hellip; <em>(ToDo: Come up with a sample.)</em></p>

    <p>The game is to help people cross boundaries between groups more easily. People can either happen upon stories by accident or via an app phone agent that will ask them</p>
