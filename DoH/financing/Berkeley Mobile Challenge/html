    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>I will use mobile internet devices to <em>end</em> systemic human rights abuses before 2040. No person will have to suffer in a social position that decreases their life expectancy, unless they chose to do so. In this way, all humans will have the opportunity to live the same amount regardless of where they are born.</p>

    <p>We are at a point where peace and security are inalienable. Technology is constantly increasing our ability to change our world and so long as peace relies on keeping technology constrained, the question isn't "if" there will be an attack, but "when." (I don't know what this means) </p>

    <p>I have a plan for peace that is one part new tool, one part new philosophy and one part new economy. It's a revolution, based on the insight of Gandhi, that you can't use violence to rapidly spread anything other than violence.</p> (You say you have a plan for peace, but this is the last time you mention peace)

    <h2>The Philosophy</h2>

    <p>Tens of millions of years of evolution have honed your mind into a precise machine for taking in information about your world and guiding your behavior to keep you and the people around you alive.</p>

    <p>Almost everyone is in a constant struggle between selfishness and selflessness. The thing is, there is no difference between these two so far as your brain is concerned. There are no long term stable solutions that involve only a portion of society being safe and happy.</p>

    (I know what you mean by this last sentence because I talk to you, but I don't think the connection is self-evident)

    <p>Our understanding of the world and ourselves is always a rough approximation. Thinking about the world and yourself is a useful skill that allows you to expose yourself to conditioning influences without actually having to expose yourself to actual danger. (???) Self-awareness is an amazing trick, but what most people have forgotten is that it is one tool in a wider toolbox, and most people need serious help learning how to stop.</p>

    (I don't follow this paragraph)

    <p>Learning to put down thinking is relatively simple. When faced with a choice of what you should do and what you <em>really</em> want, you do what you want and enjoy it.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, most people shouldn't do this, because they have been lying to the people around them as to what they really want. This means that their ideas about what will make them happy haven't been exposed to any sort of reality test.</p>

    <p>We are all limited and fallible. People make mistakes and there is no avoiding that. St. Augustine said, "<em>Dilige et quod vis fac.</em>" ("Be diligent and do what you want.") Being diligent is ultimately an internal process, but a diligent person is unwilling to be ashamed about what they believe to be their best self.</p>

    <h2>The Tool &mdash; M&iacute;imis</h2>

    <p>If you want to get to a point where they just do what they want all the time, the revolution will lend a hand. The first applications will look like Facebook or MySpace, but will differ in three important ways:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Complex Relationships &mdash; You won't just say that you are friends with Bob, you will describe exactly what you think about Bob.</li>
      <li>Public &mdash; Everything is keyed off e-mail addresses, so anyone with an address can say whatever they like about anyone else.</li>
      <li>Open Data &mdash; Anyone who wants to start a site that retargets the data in this site can. Their systems will, in turn, provide data to all the other sites.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>At this point, my project isn't the website -- it is the network to manage the data. In computer science speak, my project is a server-to-server <acronym title="publish/subscribe">pub/sub</acronym> network for the persistent distribution of cryptographically-signed <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> documents. I call it M&iacute;imis after M&iacute;imisbrunnr, the well of wisdom in Norse mythology. It's a mouthful, but relatively easy to understand:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Server-To-Server Network &mdash; This network is replicating data segments between webservers. Unlike a desktop network where peers are low-capacity and transient, these peers will be high-capacity and persistent.</li>
      <li><acronym title="publish/subscribe">Pub/Sub</acronym> Network &mdash; In a publish/subscribe network, when a peer connects to the network they broadcast their interests and capacities and the network intelligently reconfigures itself to more efficiently distribute new information entering the network.</li>
      <li>Persistent Distribution &mdash; Most <acronym title="publish/subscribe">pub/sub</acronym> research is focused on immediate distribution of data like stock quotes. M&iacute;imis is concerned with the long term synchronization of datasets. It might take a day for your actions on one site to make it to the others, but it eventually will.</li>
      <li>Cryptographic Signatures &mdash; Signatures let you get a document and know who created it in a way that is resistant to forgery.</li>
      <li><acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> &mdash; <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> is a metalanguage for describing information. It lets me say that a particular electronic document represents a book or a news story or an opinion. Since eventually the network will have a whole lot of information in it, it lets servers succinctly describe their information of interest.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There will be potentially hundreds of sites, and each one is gathering data about virtual identities keyed to e-mail addresses. All of that information goes into a common pool. People who choose can log onto a site and send an e-mail to all of their friends asking for their most honest impressions. To get to a point that they do what they want, they agree to let the world push back in the widest context possible: the Internet.</p> (The last jump is not clear)

    <h2>The Economy</h2>

    <p>To really address the problem of thinking, it is necessary to attack the root: scarcity. We live in a world where the methods we use for distributing resources mean that we have to struggle for fear of ending up unable to meet basic needs such as food and shelter. Thinking is a really useful competitive trait, and so long as people are worried about starving they're going to be incintivized to lie.</p>

    <p>The Department of Happiness will be a crowdsource-managed funding pool for dealing with the problem of scarcity. Anyone in the world with a good idea for improving the situation of humanity can apply for funding. They will write down in detail their plan and the world will vote on how to distribute it.</p>

    <p>They will <em>not</em>, howeve,r propose things that they don't <em>want</em> to do, nor will they submit timelines they don't <em>want</em> to keep. The money is both to help the individual refine their sense of what is true to themselves and to help everyone else. Understanding it as only selfish or only selfless is too narrow a perspective.</p>

    <p>One of the first projects out of the funding pool will be mobile applications that allow consumers to identify products from profit-donation businesses. Each profit-donation business pays the owner just like anyone else and the rest of the money goes into a funding pool. These businesses are run by people who do their best for reasons other than the promise of unlimited profit.</p>

    <p>As Edward Abbey said, "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell." One of the side effects I hope that we see from a large and easily accessible pool of venture capital will be a move away from the cookie-cutter landscape we are developing across America.</p>
(I'd end here)
    <p>My personal pet project will hopefully be one of the projects out of the pool. I hope to remove the incentive to hold massive amounts of capital by making it really awesome to make $30k/year. Dion will be semiotic-based reinforcement learning <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> controlling every possible aspect of The Anarchist Grill.</p>

    <p>She'll mine the information in M&iacute;imis and invite people to events. Whatever you've said you like and want to do, she will try to find groups of people to make that happen. While you're at the event she's paying attention to you and constanting balancing hundreds of factors so that you have as good a time as possible. Any time you're unhappy you key into the system and say what you don't like. If it can be fixed, it will be. Every night is a new experiment in how to make people happy.</p>

    <p>All of the software and hardware designs are open (as is the data) so anyone can open a similar space anywhere they want. The business will be profit-donation, so when it is as massively successful as it should be that just means bunches of money for everyone.</p>
