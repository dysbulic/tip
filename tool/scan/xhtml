    <h1>Access Response Scanning</h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.psionic.com/products/portsentry.html">Portsentry</a> is a handy little program that listens to a range of ports and lets you know if anyone tries to connect on them. Since attackers will usually run a variety of probes to determine available services before attempting to compromise a system, this can alert you to potential attacks. Portsenty also supports raw sockets under Linux and so can also detect most stealth attacks (SYN, <acronym title="FIN, URG, PUSH">Xmas Tree</acronym>, etc.).</p>
    <p>The issue is what to do when you get scanned. It entertains me to know a bit more about the situation, so these are a couple of programs I wrote for the situation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="scan.pl"><code>scan.pl</code></a>: a little perl script to run different utilities like <code>traceroute</code> and <code>whois</code> to provide some information about the host</li>
      <li><a href="scan-wrapper.sh"><code>scan-wrapper.sh</code></a>: a shell script to convert between the agruments of portsentry and the scanning script. Also it emails the results to an administrator</li>
    </ul>
