    <h1>Making a Debian CD Cover Using SVG</h1>
    <p>A while back I made a <a href="./">CD cover</a> for debian
     2.2rc1. It was one of my first artsy sort of things and I was
     happy with it. I even shared it with the debian people and got
     put in the FAQ. Unfortunately I was too busy to keep updating the
     text as releases came out and eventually it was booted.</p>
    <p>I was wandering back through old stuff and noticed those
     covers and thought, "hmm..., it is just some image compositing
     with some blending... I bet I could to that in svg and let people
     make the text whatever they want." So, this page is me figuring
     out how to do that...</p>
    <p>I need this image to fade at the border and to do that
     I will need to mask with a radial gradient. Such a svg would look
     <a href="images/gradient.svg">something like this</a>:</p>
    <div class="object">
      <object data="images/gradient.svg" type="image/svg+xml"
       width="400" height="400">
        <p>Your browser either doesn't handle svg's or doesn't handle
         the &lt;object&gt; tag</p>
      </object>
    </div>
    <p>I used Ed Mackey's <a href="images/linuxfox.png">Linux fox</a>
     (which I can no longer find a good link for). I thought it would
     work better in a vector format so I took a bit and vectorized it
     using Illustrator.</p>
    <div class="object">
      <object data="images/linuxfox.svg" type="image/svg+xml"
       width="400" height="400">
        <p>Your browser either doesn't handle svg's or doesn't handle
         the &lt;object&gt; tag</p>
      </object>
    </div>
    <p>The <a href="images/swirl.svg">swirl</a> is just a converted
     version of the <a
     href="http://www.uk.debian.org/logos/#open-use">open use
     logos</a>.</p>
    <div class="object">
      <object data="images/swirl.svg" type="image/svg+xml"
       width="400" height="400">
        <p>Your browser either doesn't handle svg's or doesn't handle
         the &lt;object&gt; tag</p>
      </object>
    </div>
    <p>Likewise the <a href="images/debian.svg">lettering</a> is just
     broken out from an <a
     href="http://www.uk.debian.org/logos/#open-use">open use
     logo</a>.</p>
    <div class="object">
      <object data="images/debian.svg" type="image/svg+xml"
       width="400">
        <p>Your browser either doesn't handle svg's or doesn't handle
         the &lt;object&gt; tag</p>
      </object>
    </div>
    <p>The process now is just compositing and adding some labels. SVG
     makes importing and manipulating images pretty easy. There is a
     basic <a href="images/cover_template.svg">template</a> which uses
     ecmascript to insert labels.</p>
    <p>The parameters can be specified using <a href="params.html">a
     form</a> or can be inserted in the URL manually. All of the
     work is done by a script in the image and there is no server
     generated content.</p>
    <p>The parameters used by the program are:
      <ul>
        <li>release: the name of the release (ex. "2.2 revision 3" or
         "woody rc 2")</li>
        <li>discname: the name of the disc (ex. "binary disc 1")</li>
        <li>discid: a short id for the disc (ex. "1")</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/">Batik</a> does not appear
     to properly handle dynamically inserted elements. They appear in
     the tree, but not on the screen.</p>
    <div class="object">
      <object data="images/cover_template.svg" type="image/svg+xml"
       width="400" height="400">
        <p>Your browser either doesn't handle svg's or doesn't handle
         the &lt;object&gt; tag</p>
      </object>
    </div>
    <p>Here is an example of the image with the query string ?discname=test%20disc%20name&amp;release=woody%201.2%20rc2&amp;discid=1</p>
    <div class="object">
      <object data="images/cover_template.svg?discname=test%20disc%20name&release=woody%201.2%20rc2&discid=1" type="image/svg+xml"
       width="400" height="400">
        <p>Your browser either doesn't handle svg's or doesn't handle
         the &lt;object&gt; tag</p>
      </object>
    </div>
  </body>
