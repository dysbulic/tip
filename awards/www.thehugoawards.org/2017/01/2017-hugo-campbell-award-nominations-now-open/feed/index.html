					<description><![CDATA[We cannot give a definitive answer because eligibility decisions are made by the current year&#039;s Hugo Award Administrators not by the Hugo Awards Web Site, and the Administrators rarely will issue rulings on hypothetical cases. That is, the only way to know for certain would be for that work to receive sufficient nominations to qualify as a finalist; the Administrators would then decide whether it was eligible or not. The general interpretation of variant editions is that they have to be sufficiently revised so as to be considered a new work. For example, the short story &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; was subsequently revised and expanded to novel length, and both versions were Hugo Award finalists in different years. (The short story won the 1960 Hugo Award for Best Short Story.)

In this case, this version is more of an abridged version, and is probably not sufficiently revised to be considered a new work. However, only the Administrators can give a definitive decision on the matter.]]></description>
