					<description><![CDATA[Yes, self-published works are eligible. Works can be published in paper, electronic, or audiobook form. Medium of publication does not matter. Works do not have to be published by a &quot;publishing company&quot; (however you want to define that). The actual wording of the rule is &quot;Hugo Awards are given for work in the field of science fiction or fantasy appearing for the first time during the previous calendar year.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Prakash:

We do not comment on specific works or their “chances.” The way you make the ballot is to come to the attention of enough members of WSFS that they decide to nominate your work. Self-published authors have been finalists and have won the Hugo Award.

Works are nominated for the Hugo Awards by the thousands of members of the World Science Fiction Society. There is no panel of judges, nor is their any mechanism for &quot;submitting&#039; a work for consideration. If enough member of WSFS nominate a work, it is shortlisted as a finalist. See our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehugoawards.org/information-for-publishers/&quot;&gt;Information for Publishers&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

					<description><![CDATA[Bob:

&lt;em&gt;Nominating&lt;/em&gt; has not yet started, and will not start until early 2018. The deadline in this post is the deadline for becoming a member in order to be &lt;em&gt;eligible to nominate&lt;/em&gt; when nominations open in early 2018. As a supporting member of Worldcon 76 (and 75), &lt;strong&gt;you are eligible to nominate for the 2018 Hugo Awards&lt;/strong&gt; when nominating opens in 2018. You need take no action at this time. We will post here when nominating opens, and you should also be contacted by Worldcon 76.

We have added additional material to this post to (we hope) make it clearer that this deadline is only about joining in order to be eligible to nominate, and that nominations themselves will not open until early 2018. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused you. Don&#039;t panic! You haven&#039;t missed anything, and you will be able to nominate when nominations open in early 2018.]]></description>
