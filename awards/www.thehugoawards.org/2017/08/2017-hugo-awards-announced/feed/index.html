					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] The 2017 Hugo Awards were announced on Friday, so it&#8217;s time for the requisite whining/celebration that peppers the steak of our blogging diet (that&#8217;s how food works, right?) Um, anyway, despite my formal participation in the awards process roughly coinciding with the Sad/Rabid Puppy era/debacle, this marks the fourth year wherein I&#8217;ve contributed to the results. This year&#8217;s awards were less directly impacted by those meddlesome puppies, but I feel like we&#8217;re still suffering through an indirect backlash and overcorrection. This isn&#8217;t exactly new, so let&#8217;s just get on with it. (For those who really want to geek out and see how instant-runoff voting works, the detailed final and nominating ballots are available.) [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lauren:

The members of the World Science Fiction Society at this year&#039;s Worldcon approved the creation of an Award for Best Young Adult Book, which is not a Hugo Award (in part because it would be unfair for the same work to be eligible in two Hugo Award categories simultaneously), but that will be administered in parallel with the Hugo Awards starting in 2018.

Most television episodes are eligible in the category Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. This year, the winner was the episode “Leviathan Wakes” of &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;. There is not an award for Best Television Series, only for individual works such as episodes.]]></description>
