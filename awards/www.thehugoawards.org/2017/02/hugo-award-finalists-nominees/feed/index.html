					<description><![CDATA[There has never been (nor is there currently) an official term for those people/works that are on the &quot;top 15&quot; list. There are many recommendation lists, so that doesn&#039;t seem like a good term either, for the same reason that we have deprecated &quot;nominee.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This makes more sense than the reverse practice, which (correct me if I&#039;m wrong) I understood was the rule before (i.e. if you made it in the top 15 but not on the ballot, you were a &quot;finalist&quot; and if you made it on the ballot, you were a &quot;nominee.&quot;)

There should be a term for a person/entity that gets a lot of nominations, even if that person/entity doesn&#039;t make the top 5.  &quot;Recommendee?&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Because when the site was built, the official term was &quot;nominee,&quot; it is challenging to retroactively change all references. However, when we notice them, we try and correct them.

When you see references to the older terminology, please let us know. Thanks for pointing out that the landing page for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehugoawards.org/history/&quot;&gt;Hugo Award History&lt;/a&gt; still had the older term in place. We have since corrected it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you want to avoid the use of the term &quot;Nominee&quot; perhaps a good start would be to stop using it in your website. On following the above link to Hugo Award History there is a further  link to past nominees and winners!]]></description>
