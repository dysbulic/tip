					<description><![CDATA[Also, I think the best fanzine winner is just one fanzine called &#039;Inside and Science Fiction Advertiser&#039;. Science Fiction Advertiser ceased as an independent publication in 1954 and merged with Inside in May 1956. I should say, though, that I&#039;m taking all this from Fancyclopedia: http://fancyclopedia.wikidot.com/inside-and-science-fiction-advertiser.

					<description><![CDATA[Alan:

When new information comes to our attention, we generally do add it. Tom Whitmore has contributed to our store of historical data here previously.

It is unclear what rules, other than &quot;Whatever the people running the election decided on the spot,&quot; applied to the 1956 Hugo Awards. In those early days of the Awards (remember that 1956 was only the third time that Hugo Awards had been presented), there wasn&#039;t the extensive documentation and published rules that there are today. The Awards were administered on the spot by each Worldcon Committee, who made their own rules. It was not until the 1960s, after the institution of the WSFS Constitution, amended by the members of the convention through the Business Meeting, that rules became more of a matter of public record.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tom Whitmore previously came across in a collection that came into Other Change of Hobbit in the late 1970&#039;s/early 80&#039;s.  He contacted Howard de Vore at that time, who dismissed it as publicity for the authors attending.  Someone else can check the membership list, but that argument sounded specious to me.  The list has worked for me through these years.
Considering our family history is so well documented, including fannish holdings in library collections, this must have come up at other times.  I hope you document it here if there is a Valid reason not to give this credence.   Someone needs to check the archives for the other missing early years.
And, what were the eligibility rules at the time, considering the inclusion of &quot;End of Summer&quot; from November 1954?]]></description>
