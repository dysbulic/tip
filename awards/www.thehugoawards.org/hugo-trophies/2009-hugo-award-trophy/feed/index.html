					<description><![CDATA[Kaja, I think you get two of those, one for Phil and one for yourself. The award goes to the creators of the works which win Hugos, not just the work itself and if it&#039;s a collaborative effort all of the primary creators receive a rocket.

 Congrats, by the way. Well-deserved (I rated GG my #1 choice on my ballot).]]></description>
