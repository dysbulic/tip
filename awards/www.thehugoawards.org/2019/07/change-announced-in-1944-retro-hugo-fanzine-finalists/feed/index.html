There is no Hugo Award Committee. The Hugo Award finalists and winners are selected each  year by several thousand members of the World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), a large group of people who do a great deal of reading in the science fiction and fantasy genres. 

For more information on how this process works, see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-faq/&quot;&gt;Hugo Award Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).]]></description>
