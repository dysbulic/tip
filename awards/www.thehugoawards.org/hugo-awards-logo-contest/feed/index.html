					<description><![CDATA[Amateur art contests have a long tradition. As long as everyone knows up front what the terms are -- specifically what rights the entrants are granting to whom -- and is comfortable with those terms, there&#039;s absolutely nothing wrong with it.

Yes, a contest will produce a relatively small percentage of seriously interesting material. As long as the organizers are willing to spend the time wading through the &quot;slush pile&quot; looking for those few, that&#039;s fine too. And if they don&#039;t find anything good enough, I&#039;m sure they have sense enough to shrug, award the prize, and then continue looking for something which does meet their needs... either contributed or commissioned.

If you aren&#039;t sufficiently amused by the game, don&#039;t play... but I don&#039;t see any reason to attack it. It&#039;s in no way a threat to the pros, or an exploitation of the amateurs. And the two groups do sometimes overlap.

Paraphrasing Walt Kelly&#039;s characters: &quot;Don&#039;t take life so serious, son. It ain&#039;t nohow permanent.&quot;]]></description>

That is why the actual words in the rules are &quot;midnight (one minute after 23:59) on May 31st, 2009&quot; in order to clarify that we mean 2400 on May 31 (end of the day), not 0000 (beginning of the day).

No matter how you plan to quibble about it, we&#039;ll accept any entries submitted on May 31 (Pacific Daylight Time, which is UTC - 7).  If you prefer, that&#039;s 0700 June 1 UTC.  Thank you, however, for leading me to note that we said &quot;Standard&quot; when we meant &quot;Daylight.&quot; I&#039;ve fixed it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m afraid you&#039;ve out-clevered yourselves on the End date.

What you&#039;ve actually set it as is 2400, 30-May-2009; that is, while you *say* May 31st, entries may not actually be *submitted* on May 31st, as the deadline is past.

If you mean 2359 on 31-May (which is more sensible), that&#039;s probably how you should phrase it -- never set deadlines at midnight; this is why insurance companies don&#039;t do it.

See you in Montreal!]]></description>
