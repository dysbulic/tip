				<description><![CDATA[The 2020 Worldcon, CoNZealand, will present Retrospective Hugo Awards for the year 1945, for works of science fiction and fantasy first published or appearing in 1944, according to an announcement posted on the CoNZealand web site. Retrospective Hugo Awards (&#8220;Retro-Hugos&#8221;) &#8230; <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/2019/09/2020-worldcon-to-present-retrospective-hugo-awards/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2020 Worldcon, CoNZealand, will present Retrospective Hugo Awards for the year 1945, for works of science fiction and fantasy first published or appearing in 1944, according to an <a href="https://conzealand.nz/blog/2019/09/04/conzealand-to-host-1945-retro-hugos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement posted on the CoNZealand web site</a>.</p>
<p>Retrospective Hugo Awards (&#8220;Retro-Hugos&#8221;) are authorized by the World Science Fiction Society for Hugo Awards held an exact multiple of 25 years prior to the current Worldcon, provided that no Hugo Awards or Retrospective Hugo Awards were already presented for that year. Retro-Hugos cannot be presented for years prior to 1939. A rule change ratified at Worldcon 75 in Helsinki opened up Retro-Hugos to the the &#8220;WW II Gap&#8221; from 1942-1945, during which no Worldcons were held. Previously, only years in which a Worldcon was held were eligible for Retro-Hugos. As with the &#8220;regular&#8221; Hugo Awards, Retrospective Hugo Awards are for works published or appearing in the previous calendar year to the year of the award.</p>
<p>Per the WSFS Constitution, the Retrospective Hugo Award categories are the same as those for the current Hugo Awards. Any categories where there are insufficient nominations will be dropped from the final ballot. The Lodestar Award and the Astounding Award for Best New Writer (formerly the John W. Campbell Award) are not Hugo Awards, and therefore there will not be retrospective versions of those awards.</p>
<p>Members of the 2019 and 2020 Worldcons as of December 31, 2019 will be eligible to nominate for both the 2020 Hugo Awards and the 1945 Retrospective Hugo Awards.</p>
<p>Administration of both the Hugo Awards and Retrospective Hugo Awards rests with the individual Worldcon committees. Direct any questions about the Hugo Awards and Retrospective Hugo Awards for the relevant years to the CoNZealand committee.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voting for the 2019 Hugo Awards and 1944 Retrospective Hugo Awards closed on August 1. The results of the voting will be announced with the presentation of the 1944 Retro-Hugo Awards on Thursday, August 15 as part of the Opening Ceremonies of Dublin 2019, an Irish Worldcon, with the 2019 Hugo Awards presented on Sunday, August 18 at Dublin 2019.</p>
<p>The 1944 Retrospective Hugo Awards will be part of the Dublin 2019 Opening Ceremony on Thursday, August 15, 2019, starting at 20:00 Irish Summer Time (UTC +1) in the Convention Centre Dublin Auditorium. This opening-night event of Dublin 2019 will be hosted by Ellen Klages and Dave Rudden, and will also include the presentation of the Big Heart and First Fandom Awards.</p>
<p>The 2019 Hugo Awards, Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book, and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer will be presented at the Hugo Awards Ceremony on Sunday, August 18, 2019 starting at 20:00 Irish Summer Time (UTC +1) in the Convention Centre Dublin Auditorium. The Hugo Awards Ceremony will be hosted by Afua Richardson and Michael Scott.</p>
<p>Further information about all of Dublin 2019&#8217;s Special Events are available <a href="https://dublin2019.com/whats-on/special-events/special-events-in-the-auditorium/">on the convention&#8217;s web site</a>.</p>
<p>Dublin 2019 intends to live-stream both the Opening Ceremonies/Retro-Hugo Ceremony and the 2019 Hugo Awards Ceremony through Vimeo. We will announce details of the live streaming when Dublin 2019 makes them available.</p>
<p>As we have done in past years, the Hugo Awards web site team will be presenting live text-only commentary (suitable for lower-bandwidth connections) of the 2019 Hugo Awards Ceremony. We will publish details of our live coverage of the Hugo Awards Ceremony closer to the day of the event and it will be the lead item here at TheHugoAwards.org on the day of the event itself. We will also be at the Retro-Hugo Ceremony, and we are currently exploring whether we can do the same live text-only commentary there as well. We will also be commenting on the Retro-Hugos via the <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHugoAwards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@TheHugoAwards Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you attend the events in person at Dublin 2019, watch them via Vimeo, or follow along with TheHugoAwards.org coverage, we hope you&#8217;ll be following this year&#8217;s Hugo Awards results coming up during the 2019 Worldcon.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2019/1944 Hugo Award Administrators announced on July 21, 2019, that <em>Guteto</em>, edited by Morojo (Myrtle R. Douglas), has been added to the 1944 Retrospective Hugo Award ballot, and that <em>Fantasy News</em>, edited by William S. Sykora, has been removed. The full text of the Administrator&#8217;s announcement is below.<br />
<span id="more-3593"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The Hugo Administrators have discovered an error in their tally of the nominations for the 1944 Retro Hugo for Best Fanzine.</p>
<p>In fact, <em>Guteto</em>, edited by Morojo (Myrtle R. Douglas) received enough votes to qualify for the final ballot; and <em>Fantasy News</em>, edited by William S. Sykora, did not.</p>
<p>We have accordingly revised the online ballot, and the downloadable ballot form, to reflect that <em>Guteto</em> is a finalist in this category, and that <em>Fantasy News</em> has been disqualified. Write-in votes for <em>Guteto</em> on previously printed hard copy versions of the ballot will be accepted.</p>
<p>We apologise to voters, and to the estates of Myrtle R. Douglas and William S. Sykora, for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>The deadline for votes on the Hugo final ballot is 11.59 pm, Pacific Daylight Time, on 31 July.</p></blockquote>
<p>Direct all questions about the 1944 Retro-Hugo Awards to the <a href="mailto:hughelp@dublin2019.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2019/1944 Hugo Award Administrators</a>, not to the Hugo Awards web site. The Hugo Awards web site does not administer the Hugo Awards. All questions about the administration of the current Awards (including the 1944 Retro-Hugos) should go to the administrators.</p>
