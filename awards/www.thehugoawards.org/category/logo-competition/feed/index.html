								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were delighted with the level of interest in the logo contest. We received 390 entries from 215 different people and 24 different countries. Deciding on a winner proved very difficult.</p>
<p>The jurors were impressed with the standard of submissions, and of the many very different conceptions of the award, and were thrilled by how many of the submissions made their shortlist.</p>
<p>In making their decision our expert jury took a wide range of factors into account. Many very attractive pieces of art were rejected because they were too complex to be effective when added to a book or DVD cover. In other cases excellent images were let down by weak typography. The winner, designed by Jeremy Kratz of Arkansas, combined both the necessary simplicity to fulfill our requirements with a good choice of text and pleasing combination of the various elements of the design.</p>
<p>We would like to thank all of the people who entered the contest, and congratulate Jeremy on his win.</p>
<p>Here is the winning design.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have been receiving a few inquiries asking if we have a winner in the logo contest yet. The answer is that our judges are still deliberating. We had a lot more entries than we expected, many of very good quality. When we have chosen a winner we will post here and email the unlucky entrants. As previously announced, we do not plan to unveil the new logo before <a href="http://www.anticipationsf.ca/">this year&#8217;s Worldcon</a> at the beginning of August.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As scheduled, the contest to find an official logo for the Hugo Awards closed at midnight Pacific Time on May 31st, 2009.  390 entries were received from 219 entrants, with a little over half arriving during the last five days of the contest.  New entries continued to arrive right up until the final minutes that the contest was open, including several submitted within five minutes of the contest deadline.</p>
<p>We have processed and acknowledged all of the entries in the Hugo Award Logo Contest that we have received.  If you submitted an entry and have not received an acknowledgment or request for additional information, contact us at <mailto:logocontest@thehugoawards.org>logocontest@thehugoawards.org</a> to follow up and trace your entry.</p>
<p>It will take some time for the contest judges to evaluate the submitted designs, and we therefore cannot promise a specific date by which we will contact entrants with the results of their deliberations.  We continue to plan to announce the final results at this year&#8217;s Worldcon, <http://www.anticipationsf.ca/>Anticipation</a>, if we are able to do so.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hugo Awards has a rocket, but there is no easily usable logo that people can put on web sites, on book covers and so on. We thought it was about time we had one. So we are launching a contest. If you are a talented graphic designer, or you know one, please spread the word. The winning design is likely to appear all over the Internet, and in bookstores; maybe even on movie screens. Full details of the contest are available <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=275">here</a>. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=281">submission guidelines</a> and <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=295">official rules</a>. We are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
