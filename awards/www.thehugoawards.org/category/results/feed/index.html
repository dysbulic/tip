We thank Jo Van Ekeren for reconstructing the detail reports from contemporaneous accounts of the 1989 Hugo Awards and for pointing out the omission of the 1989 Campbell Award results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to new information coming to light, we have updated the <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1956-hugo-awards/">1956 Hugo Award history page</a> with the finalists that appeared on the ballot that year. We thank Olav Rokne for bringing to our attention an article on page 15 of the <a href="http://fanac.org/worldcon/NYcon/w56-pr3.pdf" target="_blank">1956 Worldcon Progress Report 3</a> that included the names of the finalists along with voting instructions. </p>
<p>Note that the order in which the finalists are listed is the same order that they appeared in the progress report and does not imply order of finish on final ballot. According to the article, the final ballot included space for write-in candidates. In Best Professional Magazine, no finalists were listed at all, so all votes were write-ins.</p>
<p>Voting rules in 1956 were significantly different from those currently in use. The shortlist was not formed based on an initial poll as is done today, but apparently by the convention committee. Should we obtain additional information about the detailed voting for this or any other year, we will add it to the relevant history page.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With apologies for the delay, we are now able to release the full voting breakdown for the 1941 Retro Hugo Awards. You can find the document <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/content/pdf/1941HugoStatistics.pdf">here</a> (pdf).</p>
<p>We have also updated the <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/content/pdf/2016HugoStatistics.pdf">2016 statistics document</a> to correct a small number of typographical errors in the original document. These did not affect the results of the Awards in any way, and all of the numbers were correct. The only significant change is in the top 15 for fancast where <em>The Coode Street Podcast</em> was incorrectly listed twice. The second listing should have been for <em>Jay and Miles X-Plain the X-Men</em>, presented by Jay Edidin and Miles Stokes.</p>
