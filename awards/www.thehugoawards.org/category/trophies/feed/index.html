								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="trophy" src="http://www.thehugoawards.org/content/weston/weston.jpg" alt="Peter Weston with a Hugo Award rocket" align="left" /> Peter Weston, the man who created the current version of the iconic Hugo Award rocket, died on January 5, 2017, aged 73, according to <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/News/2017/01/peter-weston-1944-2016/">a report published by <em>Locus Online</em> today</a>. Although each Worldcon designs its own Hugo Award trophy base, since 1984, all metal Hugo Award trophy rockets have been cast from a mold created by Weston at the foundry he owned. (Non-metallic trophies followed the same design but were constructed using a different process.) </p>
<p>Weston gave <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-trophies/making-hugos/">presentations about the making of Hugo Award rockets</a> and made the presentation available to The Hugo Awards web site for us to preserve here. The World Science Fiction Society recognized Weston&#8217;s contributions to the Hugo Award by including his name in the WSFS Constitution after the original designers of the Hugo Award trophy, Jack McKnight and Ben Jason.</p>
<p>Besides his contributions to the Hugo Awards, Weston chaired the 1979 Worldcon in Brighton, UK, and was Fan Guest of Honor at the 2004 Worldcon. He edited anthologies and was a finalist for the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Related Work for his memoir, <em>Stars in My Eyes: My Adventures in British Fandom</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MidAmeriCon II, the 2016 Worldcon, announced on June 13 via their Twitter feed that they have selected designers for the 2016 Hugo Award and 1941 Retrospective Hugo Award trophy bases. Sara Felix (president of the Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists) will design the 2016 Hugo Award base and Brent Simmons will design the 1941 Retro-Hugo Award base.</p>
<p>The Hugo Award trophy consists of a <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-trophies/hugo-base-specifications/">standard rocket design</a> on a base. Each Worldcon is responsible for the bases for the Awards presented at their convention. In recent years, the design has been selected through an open competition judged by the current Worldcon committee.</p>
<p>Both the 2016 and 1941 bases will be revealed on August 17, 2016 at the opening ceremonies of MidAmeriCon II, the 74th World Science Fiction Convention, at the Kansas City Convention Center in Kansas City MO. The trophies will be on display throughout the weekend at the convention. The 1941 Retrospective Hugo Awards will be presented on Thursday, August 18, 2016 during the Retro-Hugo Swing Dance/Ceremony at MidAmeriCon II. The 2016 Hugo Awards will be presented at a ceremony on the evening of Saturday, August 20, 2016 at MidAmeriCon II.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voting for the 2015 Hugo Awards closed at the end of July. The Awards will be announced at a ceremony at the 2015 World Science Fiction Convention, <a href="http://sasquan.org/" title="Sasquan Web Page" target="_blank">Sasquan</a>, in Spokane, Washington.</p>
<p><a href="http://sasquan.org/events/#hugos" title="2015 Hugo Awards Ceremony" target="_blank">The 2015 Hugo Awards Ceremony</a> will be on the final night of the convention, Saturday, August 22, in the INB Performing Arts Center starting at 8 PM.  Sasquan Guest of Honor David Gerrold and Tananarive Due will host the ceremony. The ceremony will also include the announcement of the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and selected other awards.</p>
<p>Admission to both ceremonies is open to all attending members of Sasquan (and day admission holders for Saturday of the convention). No separate admission or ticket is required. Formal attire is neither required nor prohibited; in other words, feel free to dress up for the event, but don&#8217;t be afraid to come as you are.</p>
<p>The ceremony is planned to be live-streamed via UStream by Sasquan, and also will be covered by text-based coverage on CoverItLive by the Hugo Awards Web Site team. Results of the Awards will also be posted on the Hugo Awards web site shortly after the end of the ceremony.</p>
<p>The design for the base of the 2015 Hugo Awards will be unveiled at the Sasquan Opening Ceremonies on Wednesday, August 19, at 3 PM, and the sample trophy will be on display throughout the convention in the Exhibits area.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reviewing the design proposals, Loncon 3 has selected the winner of the design competition for the Loncon 3 Hugo Award bases.</p>
<p>The winning design for the 2014 award was submitted by Joy Alyssa Day. This is Ms. Day&#8217;s first Hugo base design. The base for the 1939 Retro Hugo will be created by Marina G&eacute;lineau, who also participated in the design competition. This is Ms. G&eacute;lineau&#8217;s second Hugo base; she previously designed the 2011 base awarded by Renovation. Both bases will be unveiled at the Opening Ceremony of Loncon 3 and will be on display throughout the run of the convention.</p>
<p>The actual Hugo Award trophy takes the form of a silver rocket. (The original concept by Jack McKnight and Ben Jason was inspired by the gleaming finned rocketships of Willy Ley.) The exact design has become standardized in recent years and the rockets are currently produced by British fan Peter Weston. The base on which the rocket is mounted is the responsibility of each Worldcon committee, and therefore the design changes each year, often inspired by the location of the convention. </p>
