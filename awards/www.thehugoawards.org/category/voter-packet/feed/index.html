								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The final ballot for the 2018 Hugo Awards, WSFS Award for Best Young Adult Book, and John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and for the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards opened on May 3, 2018. Members of Worldcon 76 can vote at the <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/hugos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 Hugo Awards web page</a>. Voting is open to all supporting and attending members of Worldcon 76. Members can vote online or by using a paper ballot downloaded from the website. Voting will be open through July 31, 2018.</p>
<p><span id="more-3198"></span></p>
<p>Members of Worldcon 76 can vote online using the electronic ballots at the <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/hugos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 Hugo Awards web page</a> and using the electronic PINs issued to them. If you have your PIN from the nominating phase of voting, you can use that number. Worldcon 76 will send e-mail to all of its eligible members who registered an e-mail address with the convention, including those members who previously received messages during the Nominating round. E-mail messages will be sent out in batches within a week of the opening of voting. You can also write to hugopin@worldcon76.org to recover your voting information if you do not know it. Alternatively, you can download a PDF of the paper version of the Hugo Final Ballot and send it by postal mail. (Paper ballots do not require a PIN to vote.) Paper ballots will also be included in Worldcon 76 Progress Report 3, scheduled for mailing in late May 2018.</p>
<p>Worldcon 76 is preparing a <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/entry/2018-hugo-awards-voter-packet-now-available" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hugo Voter Packet</a> of finalists for the 2018/1943 Hugo Awards. This package includes works shortlisted for the final ballot as provided by the rights holders for those members of Worldcon 76 to evaluate. Works appear in the Hugo Voter Packet by the generosity of the rights holders. Worldcon 76 cannot guarantee the availability of any given finalist work to appear in the Hugo Voter Packet. The Hugo Voter Packet will be available only to members of Worldcon 76. Further information about the Hugo Voter Packet will be announced in May 2018 when it is available, and Worldcon 76 will contact all of its eligible members when the packet is available.</p>
<p>The Final Hugo Award Ballot includes the finalists for the <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2018-hugo-awards/">2018 Hugo Awards</a> and <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1943-retro-hugo-awards/">1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards</a> selected by the members of the 2017, 2018, and 2019 Worldcons through the nominating process earlier in 2018. Members of Worldcon 76 will vote on the 2018 Hugo Awards as well as the WSFS Award for Best Young Adult Book and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. In addition, members of Worldcon 76 will also vote on the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards for works originally published in 1942. Under the <a href="http://www.wsfs.org/rules-of-the-world-science-fiction-society/">rules of the World Science Fiction Society</a>, Worldcons held an even multiple of 25 years after a year for which no Hugo Awards (or Retro-Hugos) were presented but after Worldcon was founded in 1939 are authorized to present Retrospective Hugo Awards for that year. Worldcon 76 elected to exercise that right. No Hugo Awards were presented in 1943 (Worldcon itself was not held that year due to World War II.)</p>
<p>Voting for the 2018/1943 Hugo Awards will be open through July 31, 2018. Ballots must be received (not postmarked) by that date. Any person who joins Worldcon 76 as either a supporting or attending member by the end of July 2018 may vote on the 2018/1943 Hugo Awards. Worldcon 76 encourages those persons who want to become a member of the convention to do so sooner, not later, and to not wait until the deadline. See the <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/membership/how-to-register" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 membership page</a> for more information about joining Worldcon 76.</p>
<p>The 1943 Retro-Hugo Awards will be announced as part of the opening night events at Worldcon 76, where the convention “invites you on the evening of August 16, 2018, to walk the red carpet back through time to a 1943 Worldcon that never was, and celebrate with other fans the works of 1942.”</p>
<p>The 2018 Hugo Awards will be presented at the Hugo Awards Ceremony on the final night of Worldcon 76, Sunday, August 19, 2018.</p>
<p>The 2018 and 1943 Hugo Awards are administered by Worldcon 76, not by the Hugo Awards web site. Direct all questions about the administration of the 2018/1943 Hugo Awards to the Worldcon 76 Hugo Awards Administration Subcommittee at hugoadmin@Worldcon76.org.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2017 Hugo Voter Packet, a selection of works shortlisted as finalists for the 2017 Hugo Awards and made available to all voting members of the 2017 Worldcon, is now available. Worldcon 75 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/worldcon75/posts/1377430558999614
">announced in a Facebook post on May 17</a> that &#8220;Messages have gone out to voters, including personalized links and information on how to access the packet. Anyone who has not received it should contact hugohelp@worldcon.fi.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement also explains that the Hugo Voter Packet &#8220;includes many of the works on the final ballot in full, preview versions of others, and work by most of the individuals who are finalists.&#8221; Participation in the Hugo Voter Packet is voluntary, and is completely at the discretion of the various rights holders of the nominated works and of the individual finalists. The packet is organized and created by the individual Worldcon committees, and is not a required Worldcon function; however,  many recent Worldcons have organized such packages for the benefit of their members to make it easier for them to evaluate the finalists.</p>
<p>The Hugo Voter Packet for 2017 is administered by the 2017 Worldcon, not the Hugo Awards web site. Direct any questions about the packet to hugohelp@worldcon.fi.</p>

See the <a href="http://midamericon2.org/home/hugo-awards-and-wsfs/1941-retro-ballot/" target="_blank">1941 Retrospective Hugo Awards voting page</a> and the <a href="http://midamericon2.org/home/hugo-awards-and-wsfs/2016-hugo-ballot/" target="_blank">2016 Hugo Award voting page</a>. for the respective 1941 and 2016 Finalist Packets. In both cases, members will use their online voting information to access the Finalist Packets.</p>
<p>Hugo Finalists Packets are organized by the individual Worldcon committees, and obviously there is no requirement that a shortlisted work appear in the Packet. For questions about this year&#8217;s two sets of Finalist Packets, contact MidAmeriCon II. The Hugo Awards web site does not organize the Hugo Voter Packet or the voting on the Hugo Awards.</p>

Members of the 2016 World Science Fiction Convention (MidAmeriCon II) may vote until 23:59 Pacific Daylight Time on July 31, 2016 using the online ballot available at the <a href="http://midamericon2.org/home/hugo-awards-and-wsfs/2016-hugo-ballot/" title="2016 Hugo Awards Voting" target="_blank">2016 Hugo Awards Voting web page</a>, or by using the paper ballot that will be sent to members and can be downloaded from the MidAmeriCon II web site. Persons who join MidAmeriCon II by July 31, 2016 (the close of voting) are eligible to vote. Members who registered an e-mail address with the 2016 Worldcon will receive instructions including a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for accessing the online ballot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2016-hugo-awards/" title="2016 Hugo Awards Finalists">Finalists for the 2016 Hugo Awards</a> and <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1941-retro-hugo-awards/" title="1941 Retro-Hugo Awards Finalists">1941 Retrospective Hugo Awards<a> were selected by nominations received by more than 4,000 members of the 2015, 2016, and 2017 Worldcons. Only Attending, Young Adult, and Supporting members of the 2016 Worldcon can vote on the final ballot. The ballot includes the finalists for the Hugo Awards and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer (sponsored by the publisher of <em>Analog</em>). The Campbell is not a Hugo Award but is administered and voted upon using the same system as the Hugo Awards and is presented at the Hugo Awards ceremony.</p>
<p>The Hugo Awards Final Ballot uses the &#8220;Instant Runoff Voting&#8221; (IRV) system. Voters rank their preferences among the nominated works. They mark the work they want to win with a 1, the work they would prefer if their first choice was not on the ballot with a 2, and so forth. Voters need not rank all choices. For more information about how the voting system works, see <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/the-voting-system/">this page</a>.</p>
<p>A choice of &#8220;No Award&#8221; is always listed in each category. If this option wins, no Hugo Award is presented in that category for that year. </p>
<p>MidAmeriCon II is preparing a &#8220;Hugo Voter Packet.&#8221; This is a collection of shortlisted works or excepts of such works provided by the publishers and rights-holders to allow the voters to be better informed about their choices. MidAmeriCon II expects to release the Hugo Voter Packet in late May 2016. The Hugo Voter Packets (both for the 2016 and 1941 Awards) will be available from the <a href="http://midamericon2.org/home/hugo-awards-and-wsfs/2016-hugo-ballot/" title="2016 Hugo Award Voting" target="_blank">2016 Hugo Awards Voting web page</a>.</p>
<p>The results of the 1941 Retrospective Hugo Awards will be announced on Thursday, August 18, 2016 during the Retro-Hugo Swing Dance/Ceremony at MidAmeriCon II in Kansas City, Missouri. The results of the 2016 Hugo Awards will be announced at a ceremony on the evening of Saturday, August 20, 2016 at MidAmeriCon II. The ceremony is planned to be shown live on streaming video and lower-bandwidth text-only coverage of the event will be provided through the Hugo Awards web site. Details of the live streaming and text-based coverage will be announced in August.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2015 Hugo Voter Packet, containing works nominated as finalists for the 2015 Hugo Awards, is now available for download. Any voting member of Sasquan, the 2015 World Science Fiction Convention, can download the <a href="http://sasquan.org/hugo-awards/packet_download/" target="_blank">2015 Hugo Voter Packet</a>. To receive the packet, you must be a member and download the packet no later than 31 July 2015. </p>
<p>This free download of Hugo Award finalists is supplied free of charge as a courtesy by the creators and publishers of works that are nominated for the awards. The purpose of the Hugo Voter Packet is to allow those who are voting on the Hugo Awards to be able to make an informed choice among the nominated works.</p>
<p>All of the short fiction and graphic novels are included in their entirety. The packet contains the full text of three of the novels: <em>The Dark Between the Stars</em> by Kevin J. Anderson, <em>The Goblin Emperor</em> by Katherine Addison, and <em>The Three Body Problem</em> by Cixin Liu. <em>Skin Game</em> by Jim Butcher and <em>Ancillary Sword</em> by Ann Leckie are represented by extensive excerpts. One of the five finalists in the Related Work category is represented by an excerpt: <em>Letters from Gardner</em>, by Lou Antonelli. There is some material in each of the other categories except the two Dramatic Presentation categories. Not all finalists/rights-holders agreed to include their shortlisted work in this packet, nor were they under any obligation to do so. Their participation in the Hugo Voter Packet is entirely voluntary, as is of of course all of the work done by Sasquan&#8217;s staff to organize the packet.</p>
<p>Voting on the Hugo Awards is open to all Supporting and Attending (including Young Adult and Military) members of Sasquan, the 2015 Worldcon. More information about voting and a ballot may be found at the <a href="http://sasquan.org/hugo-awards/voting/" target="_blank">2015 Hugo Award Final Ballot</a>.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://loncon3.org/hugo_vote/retro_hugo_voter_packet.php" title="1939 Retro-Hugo Voter Packet">1939 Retro Hugo voter packet</a> is now available for download by Supporting, Attending, and Young Adult members of Loncon 3. The packet is an electronic package of nominated works made available by Hugo nominees and their publishers. The packet will remain available until voting closes at 11:59 p.m. PDT on Thursday 31 July 2014. </p>
<p>The 1939 Retro Hugos celebrate the science fiction and fantasy that fans at the very first Worldcon in 1939 would have known. The voter packet includes full editions of several of the works nominated for the Retro Hugos, though it was not possible to acquire permission for all of the nominated works to be included. </p>
<p>The 1939 Retro Hugo Awards will be presented at a ceremony on the evening of Thursday 14 August at a ceremony jointly presented by Mary Robinette Kowal and Rob Shearman, with music provided by the Brideshead Ballroom Stompers. The ceremony will be streamed live via the Internet to enable fans around the world to take part in this commemoration of the best of the science fiction and fantasy of 1939.</p>
<p>Full details of the 2014 Hugo and 1939 Retro Hugo Awards are available at the <a href="http://www.loncon3.org/hugo_awards.php" title="Loncon 3 Hugo Awards" target="_blank">Loncon 3 website</a>. Direct questions about the voter packets and the administration of the voting (such as questions about memberships and voting PINs) to Loncon 3, not to the Hugo Awards web site. We here at the Hugo Awards web site do not actually run the individual Hugo Award elections, so questions we receive can be delayed while we forward them to the current Worldcon for action.</p>
