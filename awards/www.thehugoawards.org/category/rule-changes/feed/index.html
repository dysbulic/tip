								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Worldcon 76 San Jose advises us that they will open nominations for the 2018 Hugo Awards and 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards within the next few days. They have been working with Worldcon 75 Helsinki and Worldcon 2018 Dublin to coordinate the combined membership information from all three Worldcons, and to do so within the limitations of the three countries&#8217; data-protection laws. When testing of the online nomination form is complete, Worldcon 76 San Jose will release it on the Worldcon 76 web site and make an announcement. We&#8217;ll also announce the start of nominations here on The Hugo Awards web site. Paper ballots will also be distributed with Worldcon 76 Progress Report 2, which we understand is going to press in a few days and should mail to members of Worldcon 76 in February. Besides the online form, a PDF of the paper form will be available from Worldcon 76&#8217;s web site when it is ready for release. </p>
<p>Members of the 2017 (Helsinki), 2018 (San Jose) and 2019 (Dublin) Worldcons as of December 31, 2017 are eligible to make nominations for the 2018 Hugo Awards (for works first published or appearing in 2017) and 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards (for works first published or appearing in 1942). If you are a member of more than one of those three conventions, you can still only cast one nominating ballot. Eligible members will be able to vote online at the Worldcon 76 web site or via paper ballot. The six highest-ranking nominees in each category will form the shortlist of finalists and will appear on the final ballot to be announced later this year. Only members of Worldcon 76 San Jose who join before the final ballot deadline (which is yet to be announced) will be eligible to vote on the final ballot.</p>
<p>Each Worldcon committee is a legally separate entity; therefore, the sharing of information between Worldcon committees is subject to any restrictions imposed by local law, which of course supersedes any requirements of the WSFS Constitution.</p>
<p>This is the final year that members of the subsequent year&#8217;s Worldcon are eligible to nominate on the current Hugo Awards. A change ratified in Helsinki and first effective with the 2019 Worldcon limits nominating to members of the current and previous Worldcon as of the end of the previous calendar year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2018 and 2019 Worldcons will present Retrospective Hugo Awards for the years 1943 and 1944, the two conventions announced jointly at SMOFCon 35, the annual SF/F conrunners convention, in Boston on December 2, 2017.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 in San Jos&eacute;</a> will present the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards for works first published/appearing in 1942. <a href="https://dublin2019.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dublin 2019: An Irish Worldcon</a> will present the 1944 Retrospective Hugo Awards for works first published/appearing in 1943.</p>
<p><span id="more-3070"></span><br />
Worldcon 76 in San Jose in their announcement &#8220;invites you on the evening of August 16, 2018,  to walk the red carpet back through time to a 1943 Worldcon that never was, and celebrate with other fans the works of 1942.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dublin 2019, An Irish Worldcon &#8220;is planning a First Night extravaganza, combining Opening Ceremonies and the Retro Hugos, celebrating the past, present and future of both the genre and Worldcon,&#8221; according to the joint announcement and a press release from Dublin 2019.</p>
<p>Retrospective Hugo Awards (&#8220;Retro-Hugos&#8221;) are authorized by the World Science Fiction Society for Hugo Awards held an exact multiple of 25 years prior to the current Worldcon, provided that no Hugo Awards or Retrospective Hugo Awards were already presented for that year. Retro-Hugos cannot be presented for years prior to 1939. A rule change ratified at Worldcon 75 in Helsinki opened up Retro-Hugos to the the &#8220;WW II Gap&#8221; from 1942-1945, during which no Worldcons were held. Previously, only years in which a Worldcon was held were eligible for Retro-Hugos. As with the &#8220;regular&#8221; Hugo Awards, Retrospective Hugo Awards are for works published or appearing in the previous calendar year to the year of the award.</p>
<p>Per the WSFS Constitution, the Retrospective Hugo Award categories are the same as those for the current Hugo Awards. Any categories where there are insufficient nominations will be dropped from the final ballot.</p>
<p>Members of the 2017, 2018, and 2019 Worldcons as of December 31, 2017 will be eligible to nominate for both the 2018 Hugo Awards and the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards. Members of the 2018 and 2019 Worldcons as of December 31, 2018 will be eligible to nominate for both the 2019 Hugo Awards and the 1944 Retrospective Hugo Awards. (As the result of a rule change ratified at Worldcon 75 in Helsinki, members of the following Worldcon will no longer be eligible to nominate on the current Worldcon&#8217;s Hugo Awards effective as of the 2019 Worldcon.)</p>
<p>Administration of both the Hugo Awards and Retrospective Hugo Awards rests with the individual Worldcon committees. Direct any questions about the Hugo Awards and Retrospective Hugo Awards for the relevant years to the respective Worldcons&#8217; Hugo Administrators.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the agenda for ratification at this year&#8217;s Worldcon is a new Worldcon-sanctioned award for Young Adult fiction. This is not a Hugo Award, but a new award administered similarly to the Hugo Award. If ratified this year, it will be first presented at Worldcon 76 in San Jose in 2018. The committee that has been working on the proposal is now <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPJlnD7hXaVI7Q5vntFW3OpEp2PqF6QhqGu2VmP71JR3Fn9Q/viewform" target="_blank">soliciting feedback on the short list of potential names</a> for the award. The committee considered and discarded names of persons, as well as names of existing awards and names that could cause trademark/copyright issues.</p>
<p>The committee will make recommendations to the WSFS Business Meeting in Helsinki. The Business Meeting is the body that has the final right to pick a name for the Award.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2017 Worldcon in Helsinki, Finland (Worldcon 75) has opened nominations for the 2017 Hugo Award and John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer  See the <a href="http://www.worldcon.fi/wsfs/hugo/" target="_blank">2017 Hugo Awards page</a> at the Worldcon 75 web site for full details.</p>
<p><span id="more-2871"></span></p>
<p>Anyone who is or was a voting member of the 2016, 2017, or 2018 Worldcons by the end of the day on January 31, 2017 is eligible to nominate. You may nominate only once, regardless of how many of those three Worldcons you are a member.</p>
<p>Nominations close at 06:59 UTC on March 18, 2017 (March 17, 2017 23:59 North American Pacific Daylight Time / UTC &#8211; 7). The works/people receiving sufficient nominations in this first stage of the balloting will go on to the final ballot, which will be announced later in 2017. Only members of the 2017 Worldcon will be eligible to vote on the final ballot. The January 31 membership deadline does not apply to the final ballot, only the nominating ballot.</p>
<p>In general, works first published or appearing in calendar year 2016 are eligible for the 2017 Hugo Award. Works previously published in languages other than English but first published in English in 2016 are eligible. Works previously published outside of the USA but first published in the USA in 2016 are eligible.</p>
<p>Medium of publication is irrelevant: works published or appearing online are considered the same as if published in hard-copy form or shown on television or in theaters, including film festivals. Self-published works in any medium are eligible. Works published in multiple parts, such as serialized stories including graphic works, are eligible if their final part appeared in 2016. Detailed rules for the Hugo Award are contained in Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.wsfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WSFS-Constitution-as-of-August-22-2016.pdf" title="2016-17 WSFS Constitution" target="_blank">World Science Fiction Society&#8217;s constitution</a>.</p>
<p>Worldcon 75 has exercised its authority to add an additional category, &#8220;Best Series,&#8221; to the 2017 Hugo Awards. The definition of Best Series is substantially the same as that of a proposed new permanent Hugo Award category that received first passage at the 2016 Worldcon and that is up for ratification at the 2017 Worldcon.</p>
<p>There were a number of changes to the rules regarding the Hugo Award nominations ratified by the 2016 World Science Fiction Society Business Meeting. Most notably, there will be now six finalists in each category (members still make up to five nominations per category), and nominations will be tallied using a method designed to reduce the impact of &#8220;bloc&#8221; voting. Worldcon 75 has published a guide to <a href="http://www.worldcon.fi/wsfs/hugo-new/" target="_blank">what&#8217;s new with the Hugo Awards this year.</a></p>
<p>Direct specific questions about the 2017 Hugo Awards to the <a href="mailto: hugos@worldcon.fi">2017 Hugo Award Administrators</a>. Please do not ask specific questions about the 2017 Hugo Awards by commenting here or sending inquiries to TheHugoAwards.org. The team managing this web site does not actually run the individual awards, so we can only forward your questions to the current year&#8217;s Hugo Award Administrators, which will delay a reply.</p>
<p>Besides voting online (which requires a custom web link issued by the 2017 Worldcon), members can also vote using a paper ballot. Members of the current Worldcon will be receive paper ballots with the convention&#8217;s Progress Report 3. Contact the <a href="mailto: hugos@worldcon.fi">2017 Hugo Award Administrators</a> for alternative methods of nominating. Note that the online voting system allows you to make changes to your nominations until the close of nominations.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the interest of maintaining neutrality, we cannot approve any comments on TheHugoAwards.org promoting (or criticizing) specific works or people. If you post such a comment, we will not let it out of moderation. There are other venues (some of which are listed on the sidebar under &#8220;Third Party Recommendation Sites&#8221;) that are appropriate for discussing recommendations for the Hugo and Campbell Award. TheHugoAwards.org does not endorse any of the content of those sites.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Worldcon 75 in Helsinki has announced that it will use its special powers to create one Hugo Award category to trial the proposed Best Series Hugo. This is in line with current tradition whereby seated Worldcons use their category creation power to test proposed new categories that have passed one Business Meeting and are up for ratification at the Worldcon in question. This gives members of WSFS an opportunity to see the category in action before voting on ratification.</p>
<p>The full text of the Worldcon 75 press release is as follows:<br />
<span id="more-2841"></span><br />
The 75th World Science Fiction Convention, (&#8220;Worldcon&#8221;) taking place in Helsinki in August 2017, announced today that a special Hugo category for “Best Series” will be included in the 2017 Hugo Awards.</p>
<p>The Hugo Awards are the leading awards for excellence in the field of science fiction and fantasy, and have been presented at Worldcons since 1953. They are voted on by members of each year&#8217;s Worldcon.</p>
<p>Fans voted in August 2016  to trial a new Hugo award for “Best Series”, which could be added in 2018. Each Worldcon Committee has the authority to introduce a special category Hugo award, and Worldcon 75 has decided to test “Best Series” in 2017. This follows the precedent of the 2009 Worldcon, which trialed “Best Graphic Story” before it became a regular Hugo the following year. Fans at Worldcon 75 will be able to decide whether to ratify the “Best Series” for future years and suggest revisions to the award definition at the World Science Fiction Society Business Meeting held in Helsinki during the convention.</p>
<p>Nicholas Whyte, Worldcon 75 Hugo administrator, said, &#8220;The proposed Hugo for “Best Series” is a big change, the first time that a new category may be added to the written fiction Hugo categories in fifty years. There is clearly a great deal of interest in how this new award will work, and what might be nominated.” </p>
<p>An eligible work for this special award  is a multi-volume science fiction or fantasy story, unified by elements such as plot, characters, setting, and presentation, which has appeared in at least three volumes consisting of a total of at least 240,000 words by the close of the calendar year 2016, at least one volume of which was published in 2016. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been some confusion over the meaning of &#8220;professional&#8221; and &#8220;non-professional&#8221; as used on this year&#8217;s Hugo Awards ballot. A new definition of what &#8220;professional&#8221; means for the purposes of the Hugo Awards went into effect this year, as an amendment to the <a href="http://www.lonestarcon3.org/wsfs/constitution.pdf" title="WSFS Constitution 2012-13" target="_blank">WSFS Constitution</a> adding the following section:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>3.2.11</strong>: A Professional Publication is one which meets at least one of the following two criteria:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) it provided at least a quarter the income of any one person or,<br />
(2) was owned or published by any entity which provided at least a quarter the income of any of its staff and/or owner.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the 12 &#8220;general provisions&#8221; listed in section 3.2 of the Constitution, which means it&#8217;s not part of the rules for any particular category, but applies generally except when there is a specific provision to the contrary in a given category. The &#8220;professional&#8221; definition affects the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Professional Artist: qualifying work must appear in a professional publication</li>
<li>Best Semiprozine: Semprozines must be non-professional publications</li>
<li>Best Fanzine: Fanzines must be non-professional publications</li>
<li>Best Fancast: Fancasts must be non-professional in nature</li>
<li>Best Fan Writer: Fan writing must appear in semiprozines, fanzines, or in generally available electronic media</li>
<li>Best Fan Artist: Fan art must appear in semiprozines, fanzines, or through other public display</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the &#8220;professional&#8221; definition does not affect the other categories on the Hugo Awards ballot. WSFS does not require that written fiction, related works, or dramatic presentations be &#8220;professionally&#8221; published, nor do the Best Editor categories mention &#8220;professional&#8221; in their descriptions.</p>
<p>On this year&#8217;s Hugo Awards ballot, the first category affected by the &#8220;professional&#8221; definition, Best Professional Artist, gives the full explanation of what &#8220;professional&#8221; means, but does not repeat that definition for the remaining categories thereafter such as Best Semiprozine. This inadvertently created some confusion over whether the &#8220;professional&#8221; definition applies to any category other than Best Professional Artist. Rest assured that this definition of &#8220;professional&#8221; does apply to all of the categories beyond and including Best Professional Artist, and bear it in mind when making your nominations in those categories.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At today&#8217;s Business Meeting at Worldcon the members of the World Science Fiction Society voted on three motions concerning the Hugo Awards that were passed in Denver last year and required ratification.</p>
<p>A motion to remove the Best Semiprozine category was <strong>not ratified</strong>, so the category will remain in effect.</p>
<p>A motion clarifying how and where material published on the Internet is eligible for Hugo Awards was ratified and comes into effect next year.</p>
<p>The motion creating the best Graphic Story category was ratified. That category is therefore in effect until at least 2012, when it is due to be revisited to check it is working well.</p>
<p>A more detailed post about the effects of these changes will be made after Worldcon is over.</p>
