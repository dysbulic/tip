								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nominating period for the 2019 Hugo Awards and 1944 Retrospective Hugo Awards is now open, according to an <a href="https://dublin2019.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Press-Release-13-Hugo-Nominations-Open.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement from Dublin 2019</a>. The convention also announced the designers for the various award bases. The 2019 Hugo Award base will be designed by <a href="https://www.jimfitzpatrick.com/">Jim Fitzpatrick</a>; that for the 1944 Retro Hugo Awards will be designed by <a href="http://www.elfireceramics.co.uk/old_site/xold_index.htm">Dr Eleanor Wheeler</a>; and the trophy for the new Lodestar Award for Young Adult Fiction will be designed by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/sillysarasue">Sara Felix</a>.</p>
<p>Instructions for accessing the online nominating form have been sent via e-mail. Check your junk e-mail/spam/promotions folders in your e-mail client for this e-mail if you did not receive it. Despite the convention&#8217;s efforts, voter information notification messages may be flagged as spam.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dublin2019.com/hugo-awards-wsfs/the-hugo-awards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dublin 2019 Hugo Awards web page</a> has the links to the online nominating ballots for the 2019 and 1944 Hugo Awards. Dublin 2019 is not using a voting PIN system. Your email from the convention will contain a unique URL that provides access to your ballot.</p>
<p>Paper ballots will be mailed to those members of Dublin 2109 who requested paper publications along with the convention&#8217;s Progress Report 3, currently in production. PDFs of the paper ballots are also available from Worldcon 76&#8217;s Hugo Awards page.</p>
<p>Nominations will close on March 16, 2019 at 06:59 UTC (11:59 pm Pacific Daylight Time on 15 March). Paper ballots must be received by mail by 15 March 2019. The Finalists for the Awards will be announced in early April.</p>
<p>Dublin 2019 will be presenting the 2019 Hugo Awards (generally for works first published or appearing in 2018) as well as the 1944 Retrospective Hugo Awards (generally for works first published or appearing in 1943). Any person who was a voting member of at least one of the 2018 or 2019 World Science Fiction Conventions as of December 31, 2018 may cast nominating ballots for the 2019 and 1944 Awards.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the 2018 Worldcon but not the 2019 Worldcon and did not give the 2018 Worldcon (San Jos&eacute;) permission to share your information with the 2019 Worldcon (Dublin), the 2019 Worldcon will not contact you, due to data-privacy rules. If you are a member of the 2018 Worldcon and did not receive an e-mail from the 2019 Worldcon but want to nominate, contact the <a href="mailto:hugohelp@dublin2019.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dublin 2019 Hugo Award Administrators</a>.</p>
<p>Included in the ballots will be voting for a Special Hugo Award of Best Art Book. Each Worldcon has the right to add one category to the Hugo Awards for their year only, and Dublin 2019 has elected to use this power to test an Art Book category.</p>
<p>The ballots will also include voting on two other awards administered by the World Science Fiction Society. These are the WSFS Lodestar Award for Young Adult Fiction; and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer presented by Dell Magazines.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions about the administration of the 2019 and 1944 Hugo Awards to the <a href="mailto:hugohelp@dublin2019.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dublin 2019 Hugo Award Administrators</a>, not to the Hugo Awards web site. The Hugo Awards web site team does not administer the elections for the Hugo Awards, nor do we make eligibility rulings. The 2019/1944 Hugo Awards are administered by the Hugo Awards Administration Subcommittee of Dublin 2019, and all decisions regarding the eligibility of works and the administration of nominations are exclusively the committee&#8217;s responsibility.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hugo Awards are selected by a vote of the members of the World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) in a two-stage process. The first stage is nominating (which starts in early 2019) and the second stage is the final ballot that includes those works/people that received enough nominations in the first stage (which starts later in 2019). If you want to participate in the nominating stage and are not yet a member of either the 2018 or 2019 Worldcons, take note of the December 31, 2018 deadline for joining Worldcon in order to be eligible to nominate in 2019.</p>
<p>If you want to nominate works/people for the 2019 Hugo Awards, <strong>you must be a member of either the 2018 Worldcon (San Jos&eacute;) or the 2019 Worldcon (Dublin) by the end of 2018</strong>. (You can of course be a member of both, but you can only nominate once.) If you were a member of <a href="https://www.worldcon76.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 San Jos&eacute;</a> (supporting or attending, or any other membership class that included voting rights), you are already eligible to nominate. If you were not a member of Worldcon 76 San Jos&eacute; and are not a member of <a href="https://dublin2019.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dublin 2019: An Irish Worldcon</a>, you must join Dublin by the end of 2018 as at least a supporting member by the end of 2018 to be able to nominate.</p>
<p>To join the 2019 Worldcon, go to the <a href="https://dublin2019.com/memberships/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dublin 2019 Membership Page</a>. You do not have to attend Dublin to be a member. A supporting membership includes all of the membership rights including nominating for the Hugo Awards, but not the right to attend the convention itself. The other membership classes including Attending and Young Adult can attend the convention and also have the nominating and voting rights. If you join Dublin as at least a supporting member by the end of 2018, you will be eligible to nominate for the 2019 Hugo Awards.</p>
<p>The final ballot will be announced sometime after nominations close. Only members of the 2019 Worldcon will be eligible to vote on the final ballot. The deadline for joining in order to vote on the final ballot is when final ballot voting closes. Dublin 2019 has not yet announced specific dates. The December 31, 2018 deadline applies only to joining in order to nominate, not to vote on the final ballot.</p>
<p>The 2019 Hugo Awards will be administered by the 2019 Worldcon. See the <a href="https://dublin2019.com/hugo-awards-wsfs/the-hugo-awards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2019 Hugo Awards web page</a> on the 2019 Worldcon&#8217;s web site for additional information. Address specific questions about the 2019 Hugo Awards to the 2019 Worldcon. The Hugo Awards web site does not run the Hugo Awards. Each year&#8217;s Awards are run by that year&#8217;s Worldcon.</p>
<p>In general, the 2019 Hugo Awards (and the 1944 Retrospective Hugo Awards, also being run by the 2019 Worldcon) are for work first published in the previous year. Therefore the 2019 Hugo Awards are for works first published in 2018 and the 1944 Retro-Hugo Awards are for works first published in 1943. There are exceptions for works previously published in languages other than English, and for works originally published outside of the USA. See the section about &#8220;Year of Eligibility&#8221; on the <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-categories/">Hugo Award Categories page</a> for a longer discussion of this.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Worldcon 76 issued the <a href="https://www.worldcon76.org/hugo/retro_packet.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards Voter Packet</a> on June 26, 2018. The &#8220;Retro-Hugo&#8221; packet is a collection of finalists (or links to finalists) for the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards made available to members of Worldcon 76 to assist them in making informed decisions when voting on this year&#8217;s Hugo Awards. The packet is available for download from the <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/wsfs/hugos/hugos-overview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 Hugo Awards website</a> in the &#8220;Hugo Voter Packet&#8221; section. Members of Worldcon 76 can sign in using their Hugo Award voting credentials that were sent to them when the final Hugo Award ballot was issued.</p>
<p>As with the 2018 Hugo Awards Voter Packet and the ballots for both the 1943 and 2018 Hugo Awards, if you experience difficulty accessing them, confirm that JavaScript is enabled in your browser and be certain that the web address you are accessing begins with https: (not http:).</p>
<p><span id="more-3226"></span></p>
<p>Only members of Worldcon 76 can access the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Award Voter Packet and vote on the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards. To become a member of Worldcon 76, see the <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/membership" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2018 Worldcon&#8217;s membership page</a>.</p>
<p>Worldcon 76 sent an announcement regarding the availability of the Retro-0Hugo Voter Packet to all members who registered their e-mail address with the convention. This mailing included a copy of the member&#8217;s voting credentials (membership number and voting PIN). Members can request a copy of their credentials using the <a href="https://www.worldcon76.org/hugo/pin_lookup.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1943/2018 Hugo Awards PIN lookup page</a>. If you are a member of Worldcon 76 and did not receive an e-mail, contact Worldcon 76 and confirm that they have your correct e-mail address.</p>
<p>Works appear in the 1943 Retro-Hugo Award Voter Packet through the courtesy and cooperation of the authors, artists, creators, and rights-holders of the shortlisted works. Not all shortlisted works will necessarily appear in the Voter Packet. No finalist is required to make their work available for the Hugo Voter Packet. The Hugo Award Voter Packet for both the 1943 and 2018 Hugo Awards will remain available until the close of voting on July 31, 2018.</p>
<p>Worldcon 76 is running both the 2018 Hugo Awards and the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards.</p>
<p>Direct all questions about the 2018 and 1943 Hugo Voter Packets and about voting procedures for the 2018 and 1943 Hugo Awards to the <a href="mailto:hugoadmin@worldcon76.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 Hugo Award Administrators</a>. Do not send questions to the Hugo Awards web site. The Hugo Awards web site does not manage the Hugo Voter Packet, nor do we administer the Hugo Awards voting. All of these functions are managed by the current Worldcon.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The final ballot for the 2018 Hugo Awards, WSFS Award for Best Young Adult Book, and John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and for the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards opened on May 3, 2018. Members of Worldcon 76 can vote at the <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/hugos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 Hugo Awards web page</a>. Voting is open to all supporting and attending members of Worldcon 76. Members can vote online or by using a paper ballot downloaded from the website. Voting will be open through July 31, 2018.</p>
<p><span id="more-3198"></span></p>
<p>Members of Worldcon 76 can vote online using the electronic ballots at the <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/hugos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 Hugo Awards web page</a> and using the electronic PINs issued to them. If you have your PIN from the nominating phase of voting, you can use that number. Worldcon 76 will send e-mail to all of its eligible members who registered an e-mail address with the convention, including those members who previously received messages during the Nominating round. E-mail messages will be sent out in batches within a week of the opening of voting. You can also write to hugopin@worldcon76.org to recover your voting information if you do not know it. Alternatively, you can download a PDF of the paper version of the Hugo Final Ballot and send it by postal mail. (Paper ballots do not require a PIN to vote.) Paper ballots will also be included in Worldcon 76 Progress Report 3, scheduled for mailing in late May 2018.</p>
<p>Worldcon 76 is preparing a <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/entry/2018-hugo-awards-voter-packet-now-available" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hugo Voter Packet</a> of finalists for the 2018/1943 Hugo Awards. This package includes works shortlisted for the final ballot as provided by the rights holders for those members of Worldcon 76 to evaluate. Works appear in the Hugo Voter Packet by the generosity of the rights holders. Worldcon 76 cannot guarantee the availability of any given finalist work to appear in the Hugo Voter Packet. The Hugo Voter Packet will be available only to members of Worldcon 76. Further information about the Hugo Voter Packet will be announced in May 2018 when it is available, and Worldcon 76 will contact all of its eligible members when the packet is available.</p>
<p>The Final Hugo Award Ballot includes the finalists for the <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2018-hugo-awards/">2018 Hugo Awards</a> and <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1943-retro-hugo-awards/">1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards</a> selected by the members of the 2017, 2018, and 2019 Worldcons through the nominating process earlier in 2018. Members of Worldcon 76 will vote on the 2018 Hugo Awards as well as the WSFS Award for Best Young Adult Book and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. In addition, members of Worldcon 76 will also vote on the 1943 Retrospective Hugo Awards for works originally published in 1942. Under the <a href="http://www.wsfs.org/rules-of-the-world-science-fiction-society/">rules of the World Science Fiction Society</a>, Worldcons held an even multiple of 25 years after a year for which no Hugo Awards (or Retro-Hugos) were presented but after Worldcon was founded in 1939 are authorized to present Retrospective Hugo Awards for that year. Worldcon 76 elected to exercise that right. No Hugo Awards were presented in 1943 (Worldcon itself was not held that year due to World War II.)</p>
<p>Voting for the 2018/1943 Hugo Awards will be open through July 31, 2018. Ballots must be received (not postmarked) by that date. Any person who joins Worldcon 76 as either a supporting or attending member by the end of July 2018 may vote on the 2018/1943 Hugo Awards. Worldcon 76 encourages those persons who want to become a member of the convention to do so sooner, not later, and to not wait until the deadline. See the <a href="http://www.worldcon76.org/membership/how-to-register" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldcon 76 membership page</a> for more information about joining Worldcon 76.</p>
<p>The 1943 Retro-Hugo Awards will be announced as part of the opening night events at Worldcon 76, where the convention “invites you on the evening of August 16, 2018, to walk the red carpet back through time to a 1943 Worldcon that never was, and celebrate with other fans the works of 1942.”</p>
<p>The 2018 Hugo Awards will be presented at the Hugo Awards Ceremony on the final night of Worldcon 76, Sunday, August 19, 2018.</p>
<p>The 2018 and 1943 Hugo Awards are administered by Worldcon 76, not by the Hugo Awards web site. Direct all questions about the administration of the 2018/1943 Hugo Awards to the Worldcon 76 Hugo Awards Administration Subcommittee at hugoadmin@Worldcon76.org.</p>

<p>Per WSFS rules, categories in which there were insufficient nominations to justify the category were dropped.</p>
<p>The Award for Best Young Adult Book and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer are not Hugo Awards, and therefore no retrospective versions of them were included on the nominating ballot.</p>
<hr>
<p>Voting for the Hugo Awards is open to any supporting or attending member of Worldcon 76. Voting will open in early May 2018 and will continue through the end of July 2018. There is no Hugo Award voting at the Worldcon itself. Voting ends before the convention to allow sufficient time to count votes and prepare trophies. Anyone who joins by the end of voting is eligible to vote.</p>
