					<description><![CDATA[Seriously? You award the Hugo Award for Best Novel to “The Calculating Stars?” This book doesn’t even have good science: an extinction event would have left most of the Eastern US population dead within minutes or hours and this is just the most egregious error. 

How far the Hugo has fallen to award what was once a prestigious award to a book that is little more than a soap opera.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hugo Awards are not awarded by a committee or board of directors or executive by fiat. They are presented in the categories listed here on our web site, and works have to be nominated by and voted upon by the members of the World Science Fiction Convention.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Hugo Awards people of the planet.
In the light of Elon Musk&#039;s presentation of their giant silver prototype starship,
I wish to suggest that you award SpaceX and or whoever appropriate the 2020 Hugo award.
Transforming such an image from early science fiction into reality surely takes the cake!!!   A true achievement on science fiction. &quot;The Martian Chronicles &quot;  

In case this sets a precedent please make sure there will be no award for Andromeda strains.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Greetings,
I am a librarian in a public library of a town in China. I am very interested in the works of the professional artists of  the Hugo Award over the years. I would like to hold a Public welfare Exhibition about these works in our library. Could you tell me how can we get the copyright of these works? We only need in E-editions. Thanks.]]></description>
