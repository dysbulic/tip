					<description><![CDATA[Sam L-Since Freas first published work was in 1950, he would have not been eligible for the 1943 award. And, no offense to you but as a general observation, I think this is the major fallacy of the Retro Hugos, especially in the fan categories. People who have not gone back and looked at who was actually doing outstanding work in the year in question (in this case, 1943), tend to just vote on the names they know, many times because they are also pros, from their more recent work.]]></description>
