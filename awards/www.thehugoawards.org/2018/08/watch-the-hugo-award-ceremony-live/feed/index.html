					<description><![CDATA[The live stream, while the event was happening, went as planned. The copyright block happened after the event happened. The main audience for this event was the live coverage. Worldcon 76 may take the necessary action to get the video unblocked, but certainly not tonight!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tried to watch it afterward, but all I see is, &quot;This video contains content from BBC Studios, who has blocked it on copyright grounds&quot;.

Time to admit that wanting to show clips of tv series and movies is more trouble than it is worth – especially as those aren&#039;t the main attraction of the evening?
(Not up to you, I know – just venting)

Thank you for the CoverItLive stream!]]></description>
