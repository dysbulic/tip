					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t expect to get all of the Hugo entries &quot;free,&quot; and that&#039;s not why I&#039;m disappointed with excerpts. I buy plenty of stuff through the year and make sure my library acquires plenty more. As mentioned, I&#039;ve already read some entries that aren&#039;t provided as full text to voters, but my time this late is limited, and I won&#039;t waste it with less than complete items. I have often experienced changes of opinion well after the first 20% of a book. As a professional reviewer I&#039;ve learned to keep both my mouth shut and my fingers off the keyboard until finishing a book.  A librarian, I use my library a lot but the Hugo nominations themselves produce long waiting lists, and I am still waiting for a couple of things for which I placed holds several months ago. With limited time, I&#039;ve gone on to reading materials that were provided in entirety in the packet, and making some wonderful discoveries. Those excerpts for which I haven&#039;t been able to acquire full text will show up on my ballot below the &quot;no award&quot; vote.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a reminder that publishers/authors/artists/rights-holders are under absolutely no obligation whatsoever to provide anything to the members of Worldcon. Sharing their shortlisted works is something they do at their own discretion, and through their own generosity. We&#039;d also like to remind people that the practice of sharing a &quot;Hugo Voter Packet&quot; is only a few years old, and that it is not a guarantee of Worldcon membership. Members are, of course, completely entitled to mark their ballots in any way they like for whatever reason they want to do so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a comment to publishers. I would NEVER vote for a book unless I read the whole thing. Those publishers who just want to provide an exerpt are SOL in my opinion. As it happens, I have already read 2 of those books for which only exerpts were provided, but I don&#039;t sign up to just get free books, but to evaluate the previous years product in my favorite genre. If someone thinks the exerpt may prompt me to run out and buy the book, it&#039;s not going to happen this late in the voting season when I barely have time to get through the rest of the material--make it easy, or it won&#039;t be on my ballot. Or at least not unless the packet gets released before May 29 when I already have a lot of books from the current year to read, too.]]></description>
