If you were a member of at least one of the 2017/2018/2019 Worldcons as of the end of December 2017, you should have by now received an e-mail with instructions for how to nominate online. (Check your spam/promotions/junk e-mail folders; despite the Worldcon&#039;s efforts, large-scale mailings may be flagged by our e-mail system as spam.) If you have not received your e-mail, use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcon76.org/hugo/pin_lookup.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Hugo PIN Lookup Form&lt;/a&gt; to request that a PIN be sent to you. If you have difficult obtaining your PIN, email hugopin@worldcon76.org for assistance. The Hugo Awards Web Site does not administer the election. We do not have the membership data including PINs. The election is managed by Worldcon 76, and you must contact them with any questions about the process.]]></description>
