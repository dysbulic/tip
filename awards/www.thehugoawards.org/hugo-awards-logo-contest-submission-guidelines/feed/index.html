					<description><![CDATA[Do you want us to specify color(s)? I&#039;ve designed some stuff in black and white that could work in a lot of different colors. But I was thinking of just submitting them in black. I was going to show a black and color version of each, but I can only enter 3.  

What do you think?]]></description>

Okay, fair enough.  The submission address was on the main logo contest page as well as the official rules, but, per your suggestion, I added it to the submission guidelines page as well.  Now it&#039;s on all three pages related to the contest, which I hope means nobody will miss it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps the submission guidelines ought to include to whom one is supposed to submit an entry? Perhaps an email address or such?

Oh, and yes, I know that the “Official Rules” contains the submission address. I’m just suggesting that it ought to be here as well.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;What happens to work that does NOT win?&quot;

Here&#039;s what their rules say:
   2. All Entries will become the sole property of WSFS and may be displayed publicly on WSFS web sites.

If you&#039;re not comfortable with these terms (or the general premise of design contests to begin with) you should probably not enter, and perhaps think twice about the likely possibility of throwing your hard work away.

Contrary to real intellectual copyright law, work you submit to any design contest claiming &quot;it owns the work it&#039;s freely gifted&quot; (and 99% of them say that) still retains ownership by the designer. Just because the rules stipulate that, it doesn&#039;t make it so.]]></description>
