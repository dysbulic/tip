					<description><![CDATA[re 2010 vs 2009: from what I know of the general book buying public, if they see “2009 volume”, they’re going to think the book is a year old, and who wants old moldy non-fresh stuff?

And we do want the general non-fannish SF reader to pick this up, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Possibly silly point. The 2010 edition will feature winners (and I&#039;d guess some nominees) from the 2009 Hugo Awards, which were for work published in 2008. Personally, and anally, I&#039;d prefer this be called the 2009 edition, rather than use a year that has no link to either the Awards year or the publication year.]]></description>
