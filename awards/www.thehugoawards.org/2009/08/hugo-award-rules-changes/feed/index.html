Please read our article about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehugoawards.org/submitting-your-work/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Submitting Your Work&lt;/a&gt;. There is no awards submission process. To be nominated for a Hugo Award, you have to get a sufficient number of members of the current and previous Worldcon to nominate it. There is no lobbying process, no jury, no board of directors, and no submission process. The awards are completely popularly voted by the members of the Worldcon.]]></description>
