					<description><![CDATA[ThatRobert... love the Logo3 one you did, the black and red one. Nice, clean, reduces down very well for small print.

Richard Holt... like that design as well, oddly was reading your page earlier today, Weird. I liked how you did the added images... I did that as well, when submitted mine I had made possible stationery for what the invites may look like, envelopes, and the logo etched in a glass trophy. 

I&#039;ll have to figure how you did that DVD hologram sticker effect though. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As stated in the submission guidelines, &quot;The logo will be used online, in print, on merchandise and to create ‚Äúwinner‚Äù stickers that can be placed on books, DVDs, etc.&quot;  The winning design needed to work at a wide variety of resolutions. 

The contest administrators, including me, were not involved in the actual selection; however, the need for the logo to work in both small and large resolutions was on the judges&#039; minds when they were evaluating the many submissions we received.]]></description>
