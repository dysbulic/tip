					<description><![CDATA[Sad to see a blessing of design contests from an org like Hugo.

If Hugo is the exception to the questionable ethics of creative service contests as I keep hearing over and over, then I’d expect Hugo to be selling that angle. Instead, they sell it like any other contest holder: “this gives a designer a head start”, etc. Just like all others it’s packaged as good fun, and even proportionately beneficial between parties.

Hugo is an umbrella org for a creative sector that is a cousin to design. Hugo certainly deserves it’s fan support, so it’s not quite picking on Hugo alone. I think those that are putting a frown on this are trying to slow the widespread perception that design contests are a healthy first resort to take advantage of for anyone. Most are grossly exploitive and go to extra lengths to be extra-exploitive in the fine print. So to hear Hugo, part of the overall greater creative services brethren adopt the usual “It’s fun for the designers, they’ll enjoy it” tone is (to me) a bit sad and insensitive.

Designers have good reason to keep their market value strong, and I think that’s all their doing here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The rules still stipulate that all work technically becomes sole property of the WSFS.

					<description><![CDATA[Tony:

The reason for that wording is that every one of the logos is going to include the words &quot;Hugo Award,&quot; and WSFS owns a registered service mark on &quot;Hugo Award.&quot;  The entrants could of course make new work based on their old work as long as it doesn&#039;t include the registered service mark.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I note in the Official rules that all entries become the sole property of WSFS, including the ones that don&#039;t win and don&#039;t receive any payment. It is also stated &quot;re-use of unsuccessful entries would be difficult without infringing existing WSFS rights.&quot; That&#039;s disturbing. That unequivocally means a lot of people are working for free.]]></description>
