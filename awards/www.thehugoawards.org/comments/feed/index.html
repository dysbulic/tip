					<description><![CDATA[That question is sufficiently open that we cannot answer it. There is no &quot;case law&quot; (administrator decisions) on which we can give you any guidance. Hugo Award administrators almost never rule on hypothetical cases, so in practice the only way to find out would be for such a work to receive sufficient nominations in the appropriate dramatic-presentation category (based on length) to make the ballot.

The Hugo Awards web site does not administer the Hugo Awards. We don&#039;t make the administrative decisions on eligibility. That is solely the responsibility of each year&#039;s Worldcon, which usually delegates the task to a small Hugo Awards Subcommittee, which is who we mean when we say the &quot;Hugo Award Administrator.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Under the current definitions, audiobooks are considered &quot;publication&quot; for the purposes of the &quot;written fiction&quot; categories. So, for example, if a novel-length work was produced as an audiobook, it&#039;s the same as a print edition of the same work (including electronic publication -- it doesn&#039;t have to be ink on pieces of paper to be considered &quot;print&quot;).

This is not merely theoretical, by the way. A few years ago, the initial publication of a work was in audio form, and the administrator ruled that audiobooks were not publication for the purpose of the &quot;written fiction&quot; categories. WSFS changed its rules to make it explicit that audiobooks are equivalent to print publication. The relevant section of the WSFS Constitution is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2.6:&lt;/strong&gt; The categories of Best Novel, Novella, Novelette, and Short Story shall be open to works in which the text is the primary form of communication, regardless of the publication medium, including but not limited to physical print, audiobook, and ebook.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that there is a pending constitutional amendment to include &quot;Series&quot; in that list, as it wasn&#039;t listed here when Best Series was added to the Constitution. This is considered as merely a technical oversight, and the amendment to add it received initial passage at the 2019 Worldcon without objection.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seriously? You award the Hugo Award for Best Novel to “The Calculating Stars?” This book doesn’t even have good science: an extinction event would have left most of the Eastern US population dead within minutes or hours and this is just the most egregious error. 

How far the Hugo has fallen to award what was once a prestigious award to a book that is little more than a soap opera.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In general, the publication of the final issue in any form (including online webcomic) starts the eligibility clock. A subsequent trade paperback collection in a subsequent year generally would not count as a new publication (unless it was substantially different than the original publication, and simply being printed in a different format is not generally considered sufficiently different).

In the hypothetical case you seem to propose here, you&#039;d have to convince the WSFS Business Meeting to extend the work&#039;s eligibility. It&#039;s hard to see, though, how one could make a reasonable case that (for example) online publication is more limited than a trade paperback of the same work, or that serial publication (in a series of comic books) is somehow more limited than publication in a collected one-volume edition. That, however, would be a matter for debate before the WSFS Business Meeting, with a 2/3 vote being necessary to extend eligibility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seeking a definitive answer to this because I&#039;ve always been confused by it:

Say a trade paperback comic volume/miniseries is published early in 202x, its final issue having been released the previous year (hypothetical 201X). Would the run being completed in 2o1x make it ineligible for the 202x Hugos or would the TPB form allow it to be nominated? Would eligibility have to be extended beforehand?]]></description>
