					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Of course, the frustrating thing about this is that most people will adamantly deny that they are misogynistic/homophobic/racist. I&#8217;d actually rather deal with someone like Vox Day of the Rabid Puppies, who is transparently racist, sexist, and homophobic, than someone like Larry Correia, who complains that people dislike him because of his beliefs without wondering if maybe the problem is that his beliefs are oppressive and offensive to much of the human race. Correia and Torgensen are adamant that they are neither racist nor homophobic nor misogynistic, while referring to the 2014 Hugo&#8217;s slate as &#8220;affirmative action.&#8221; (For the record, I&#8217;m a huge fan of almost everything and everyone who won a Hugo in 2014. Here&#8217;s the list.) [&#8230;]]]></description>
