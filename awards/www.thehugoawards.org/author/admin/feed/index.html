								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the speech delivered by Garth Nix at last night&#8217;s award ceremony. It is followed by the introductory film, &#8220;A Review of 2009,&#8221; by Mark Slater.</p>
<hr>
<p><span id="more-985"></span></p>
<p>First of all, let me acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which this convention centre is built, the Kulin Nations – and pay my respects to their elders past and present. </p>
<p>Thank you for the introduction, Kathryn. Perhaps those people at the pre-Hugo reception who thought I was their drinks waiter will now believe that I am the Master of Ceremonies. Yes, my name really is Garth Nix and I will be your MC for tonight’s august ceremony. By august I mean time-honoured and highly important, because it is of course September. I just wanted to make that clear for those of you still suffering from jet-lag. Which is probably everyone who has flown in from outside Australia.</p>
<p>Some of you, particularly those people who thought I was their waiter, may be wondering how I came to be Master of Ceremonies tonight. Let me tell you. It all began with a dream. A dream that I had when I was about twelve years old, which as they say, is the Golden Age of Science Fiction. In my dream, I was in a beautiful pastoral scene. I was minding sheep and there were several hobbits nearby, so I guess it was New Zealand. </p>
<p>I was sitting under a tree thinking rustic thoughts when all of a sudden this shining figure came down from the heavens . . . and now that I think about it, it did have a striking resemblance to Perry Middlemiss, the convention’s co-chair, only well, more shiny . . . anyway, this shining figure landed nearby and started to shuffle through a whole lot of huge gold tablets. Eventually, he found the right one and looked at it a couple of times, almost as if he couldn’t believe what was written there, and then he said:</p>
<p>Garth Nix, one day you will be standing on the stage of the Hugo Awards!</p>
<p>Shocked by this pronouncement, I stumbled forward, fell over a sheep, and abased myself. Which is not what some of you are thinking, it means to lower or bring down . . . OK, let’s say I bowed before this shining figure, and I said, “You mean I’m going to be a science fiction and fantasy writer?”</p>
<p>The shining figure said, “Well, I don&#8217;t know about that. Maybe you’ll do something . . . more useful. But sometime, who knows where and who knows when, you’re going to be the MC of the Hugo Awards!” and he handed me this huge, heavy gold tablet and there was the running order for the Hugo Awards, with about a dozen names for potential MCs scratched out and mine right there at the very bottom.</p>
<p>Sadly, when I woke up the gold tablet had disappeared. They do that, apparently. But the very next thirty-five years three months and six days later, I got an email inviting me to be the MC for the 2010 Hugo Awards. So my dream came true . . . and here I am. </p>
<p>Naturally, as soon as I accepted the invitation and had to confront the reality rather than the dream, fear and panic set in. Previous MCs or toastmasters of the Hugo Awards have included such giants of the field as Isaac Asimov, Harlan Ellison, Lester del Rey, John Brunner, Robert Silverberg, Neil Gaiman, Connie Willis . . . how could I stand in their shoes and do justice to the role?</p>
<p>Obviously I needed something to boost my confidence, and it was thinking of “standing in the shoes of previous MCs” that helped me work out what I needed. I mean it was obvious once I thought of it.</p>
<p>I needed to get a pair of Isaac Asimov’s shoes.</p>
<p>This proved to be a little bit difficult, but not impossible. So with thanks to the Shoe, Slipper and Exotic Footwear of Dead Authors department of the Museum of Science Fiction in Seattle, I am in fact wearing the cowboy boots that Isaac Asimov wore when he wrote <em>Lucky Starr Space Ranger</em>, and let me tell you that having these on has helped me immensely.</p>
<p>But soon after I got the boots, I started to wonder if that was enough and I soon realized that while it helped, I still didn’t feel confident to tackle the demanding job ahead. </p>
<p>I realised I needed something else, something suitably confidence-building from another great science fiction writer. This time I turned to possibly the largest private collection of Robert Heinlein memorabilia on the planet, and the custodians of the deep vaults in the Oakland hills below Locus headquarters were kind enough to lend me this bow tie. The very one Heinlein wore when he accepted the Hugo for <em>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</em>, one of my favourite novels.</p>
<p>But even the boots of Isaac Asimov and the bow tie of Robert Heinlein were not enough, not when I became aware there was something that would complete my ensemble for sale on Ebay. Sadly, I couldn’t afford the item in question, and nor would the convention committee give me the $50,000 I needed. So unfortunately tonight I am not wearing one of Neil Gaiman’s hand-knitted woolen singlets.</p>
<p>Without this final confidence-building item of apparel I was almost unable to come out here on stage, but fortunately at the last minute I was able to steal these Facebook-enabled wifi glasses from Cory Doctorow, and so with something old, something new, something borrowed and something  &#8230; damn it &#8230; blue &#8230; I became fully equipped to be your Master of Ceremonies tonight.</p>
<p>It is a great honour to be the MC for the Hugo Awards, because the Hugos are the most prestigious awards in science fiction. They were first awarded in 1953, and have been awarded every year since 1955.</p>
<p>As most of you know, the awards are named after Hugo Gernsback, the founder of <em>Amazing Stories</em>, the first major American SF magazine, in 1926. Sometimes called the “Father of Magazine SF” Hugo Gernsback not only has these eponymous awards, he also has a crater on the Moon named after him. Which is almost as good as having a mountain on Mars named after your family and its sporting prowess &#8212; which is what I thought Nix Olympica was for many years.</p>
<p>Every year, the Hugo nominees represent a select list of the best in science fiction and fantasy, as voted on by the members of the World Science Fiction society, that floating population of Worldcons that once a year alights on a city somewhere on this earth, and like the travelling court of a medieval ruler, celebrates all that is good and great in this usually dispersed kingdom of like-minded souls.</p>
<p>But as in all such awards, and in as in so many stories and films, though the nominees represent the best in science fiction and fantasy, only one can win. Tonight, we will put our nominees in each category into caged death matches from which only one will emerge alive &#8230; oh, actually that’s been crossed out, apparently we already know who’s won from the voting &#8230; anyway, tonight we award the winners of the 2010 Hugo Awards and we celebrate all the nominees.</p>
<p>So once again welcome to the 2010 Hugo Awards, and without further ado, let us begin.</p>
<p>To ease me gently into my introducing role, I have been allowed to start not with a difficult author, artist or fan, but with a video, in the hope that it will not bite me, act up or be offended when I mispronounce their name.</p>
<p>This video, by Mark Slater, gives us a look at the Highlights of Science Fiction and Fantasy from 2009.</p>

<p>Cheryl Morgan and Mur Lafferty will be on hand in the auditorium in Melbourne to introduce the show. Technology willing, Mary Robinette Kowal will join us from Dragon*Con. Kevin Standlee will be moderating your questions. We will also incorporate the official @Aussiecon4 Twitter feed.</p>
<p>The ceremony is due to start at 8:00pm Melbourne time. We may begin coverage slightly earlier, but both Cheryl and Mur have to be at the pre-ceremony reception where important details about the event are announced and nominees have to appear for photo shoots.</p>
<p>Please note that this coverage is text only. We are experimenting with audio and video, but this is the fastest way for us to get the results out to you. It is also more interactive.</p>
<p>Our thanks to Aussiecon 4, and to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, for helping make this possible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Worldcon is now underway in Australia. The room in which the Hugo Award ceremony is very splendid, and what&#8217;s more has excellent wi-fi coverage at a reasonable price. There is also a good 3G signal for mobile phones. It therefore looks likely that we will be able to bring you the results very promptly. We are not yet quite sure when live coverage will begin, but we&#8217;ll post when we have more information.</p>
<p>For those of you who will be at Dragon*Con it appears that there is no wi-fi connection in the restaurant where the Hugo Breakfast in being held, but we will be getting the information through to people there via Twitter.</p>

Some of them, however, can make it as far as Atlanta, and Dragon*Con has kindly laid on an event at which those nominees, and anyone else interested, can follow the action from Melbourne.</p>
<p>The event will take place over breakfast in Kafe Köbenhavn. For further details and a list of which nominees will be in attendance, see <a href="http://dailydragon.dragoncon.org/2010/live-hugo-awards-results-breakfast-with-the-nominees/">The Daily Dragon</a>.</p>
<p>We are still sorting out details of our online coverage, which is dependent on exactly what level of connectivity we can get inside the auditorium. At the very least, the folks at Dragon*Con, and you at home, will be able to follow the announcements in the Twitter feeds from <a href="http://twitter.com/thehugoawards">ourselves</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/aussiecon4">Aussiecon 4</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comic creator Phil Foglio will shortly be issuing a compendium edition of volumes #1-#3 of <em>Girl Genius</em> (volume #8 of which won the first ever Best Graphic Novel Hugo Award last year). It is part of a new graphic novel line from specialist SF&#038;F publisher, Tor. <a href="http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2010/08/interview-phil-foglio-on-the-many-lives-of-girl-genius/">Interviewed at <em>Robot 6</em></a>, Foglio was asked whether winning a Hugo Award helped him get that deal (and various others also mentioned in the article). Here&#8217;s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It did. Being able to slap &#8220;Hugo award wining&#8221; <em>[sic]</em> on something before you even publish it, that will rate an automatic &#8220;well I have to try this&#8221; in the science fiction community. A lot of people in the active science fiction community already read our stuff—there&#8217;s what we call science fiction fans and science fiction readers, and for every fan there are a hundred readers who never show up at a convention or publicly identify themselves because of the shame, but they are still aware of what the awards mean.</p>
<p>We certainly picked up more readers, we got more people interested in the book who had never heard of it before, but just being nominated did that. Howard Tayler, who does <em>Schlock Mercenary</em> [which was also nominated for a Hugo] got a lot of positive blowback on that as well. He&#8217;s up again this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks Phil, we are delighted to know that your Hugo is so helpful.</p>
<p>Our thanks to Tom Galloway for pointing us at this interview.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the nominee announcement event, Aussiecon 4&#8217;s Hugo Award Administrator, Vincent Docherty, presented some slides with voting data. The following two are quite interesting.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thehugoawards.org/content/images/2010NomStats.jpg" alt="Nominating ballot trends" /></p>
<p>This chart shows the number of nominating ballots received in recent years. Aussiecon 4 has done very well to set a new record for participation and significantly exceeding the performance of previous Australian Worldcons (marked A1 &#8211; A3).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thehugoawards.org/content/images/2010VoterLoc.jpg" alt="Nominating ballot trends" /></p>
<p>This chart shows where voters came from, sorted by postal address. As usual, the majority of voters came from the US (there are a lot of science fiction fans in America). Canada and Australia / New Zealand also produced significant numbers. In all ballots were received from fans in twenty different countries.</p>
<p>Those of you wanting detailed data on the nominating ballots, including the lists of runners up, will have to wait. These numbers are never revealed until after the winners have been announced at Worldcon.</p>
