<p>Note: in an announcement on July 21, 2019, the Hugo Award Administrators said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Hugo Administrators have discovered an error in their tally of the nominations for the 1944 Retro Hugo for Best Fanzine.</p>
<p>In fact, Guteto, edited by Morojo (Myrtle R. Douglas) received enough votes to qualify for the final ballot; and Fantasy News, edited by William S. Sykora, did not.</p>
<p>We have accordingly revised the online ballot, and the downloadable ballot form, to reflect that Guteto is a finalist in this category, and that Fantasy News has been disqualified. Write-in votes for Guteto on previously printed hard copy versions of the ballot will be accepted.</p>
<p>We apologise to voters, and to the estates of Myrtle R. Douglas and William S. Sykora, for the inconvenience.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Best Fan Writer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Forrest J. Ackerman</li>
<li>Morojo (Myrtle Douglas)</li>
<li>Jack Speer</li>
<li>Wilson &#8220;Bob&#8221; Tucker</li>
<li>Art Widner</li>
<li>Donald A. Wollheim</li>
</ul>
<p>Per WSFS rules, categories in which there were insufficient nominations to justify the category were dropped.</p>
<p>The Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer are not Hugo Awards, and therefore no retrospective versions of them were included on the nominating ballot.</p>
<hr>
<p>Voting for the Hugo Awards is open to any supporting or attending member of Dublin 2019. Voting will open later in April 2019. There is no Hugo Award voting at the Worldcon itself. Voting ends before the convention to allow sufficient time to count votes and prepare trophies. Anyone who joins by the end of voting is eligible to vote.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nominating period for the 2019 Hugo Awards and 1944 Retrospective Hugo Awards is now open, according to an <a href="https://dublin2019.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Press-Release-13-Hugo-Nominations-Open.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement from Dublin 2019</a>. The convention also announced the designers for the various award bases. The 2019 Hugo Award base will be designed by <a href="https://www.jimfitzpatrick.com/">Jim Fitzpatrick</a>; that for the 1944 Retro Hugo Awards will be designed by <a href="http://www.elfireceramics.co.uk/old_site/xold_index.htm">Dr Eleanor Wheeler</a>; and the trophy for the new Lodestar Award for Young Adult Fiction will be designed by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/sillysarasue">Sara Felix</a>.</p>
<p>Instructions for accessing the online nominating form have been sent via e-mail. Check your junk e-mail/spam/promotions folders in your e-mail client for this e-mail if you did not receive it. Despite the convention&#8217;s efforts, voter information notification messages may be flagged as spam.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dublin2019.com/hugo-awards-wsfs/the-hugo-awards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dublin 2019 Hugo Awards web page</a> has the links to the online nominating ballots for the 2019 and 1944 Hugo Awards. Dublin 2019 is not using a voting PIN system. Your email from the convention will contain a unique URL that provides access to your ballot.</p>
<p>Paper ballots will be mailed to those members of Dublin 2109 who requested paper publications along with the convention&#8217;s Progress Report 3, currently in production. PDFs of the paper ballots are also available from Worldcon 76&#8217;s Hugo Awards page.</p>
<p>Nominations will close on March 16, 2019 at 06:59 UTC (11:59 pm Pacific Daylight Time on 15 March). Paper ballots must be received by mail by 15 March 2019. The Finalists for the Awards will be announced in early April.</p>
<p>Dublin 2019 will be presenting the 2019 Hugo Awards (generally for works first published or appearing in 2018) as well as the 1944 Retrospective Hugo Awards (generally for works first published or appearing in 1943). Any person who was a voting member of at least one of the 2018 or 2019 World Science Fiction Conventions as of December 31, 2018 may cast nominating ballots for the 2019 and 1944 Awards.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the 2018 Worldcon but not the 2019 Worldcon and did not give the 2018 Worldcon (San Jos&eacute;) permission to share your information with the 2019 Worldcon (Dublin), the 2019 Worldcon will not contact you, due to data-privacy rules. If you are a member of the 2018 Worldcon and did not receive an e-mail from the 2019 Worldcon but want to nominate, contact the <a href="mailto:hugohelp@dublin2019.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dublin 2019 Hugo Award Administrators</a>.</p>
<p>Included in the ballots will be voting for a Special Hugo Award of Best Art Book. Each Worldcon has the right to add one category to the Hugo Awards for their year only, and Dublin 2019 has elected to use this power to test an Art Book category.</p>
<p>The ballots will also include voting on two other awards administered by the World Science Fiction Society. These are the WSFS Lodestar Award for Young Adult Fiction; and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer presented by Dell Magazines.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions about the administration of the 2019 and 1944 Hugo Awards to the <a href="mailto:hugohelp@dublin2019.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dublin 2019 Hugo Award Administrators</a>, not to the Hugo Awards web site. The Hugo Awards web site team does not administer the elections for the Hugo Awards, nor do we make eligibility rulings. The 2019/1944 Hugo Awards are administered by the Hugo Awards Administration Subcommittee of Dublin 2019, and all decisions regarding the eligibility of works and the administration of nominations are exclusively the committee&#8217;s responsibility.</p>
