					<description><![CDATA[Wow, thanks for all the work that went into producing. I was there in the audience -- it was my very first convention of any kind -- and this really brings back memories! Well, actually not too many of them, as it&#039;s all a little hazy after all these years. I do vividly recall Randall Garrett&#039;s &quot;Three Hearts and Three Lions&quot; and laughing after every couplet over the clever rhymes. That year&#039;s Hugos were certainly one of the highest quality ever awarded (or is that just my rose-colored glasses talking?).]]></description>
