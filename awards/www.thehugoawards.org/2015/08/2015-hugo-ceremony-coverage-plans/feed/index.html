					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re aware of this. TheHugoAwards.org does not manage the streaming video (that&#039;s done by the individual Worldcon committees). We&#039;ve been advised by Sasquan that they have raw video files from their own internal sources, but not the combined final video. If and when a version available for public release is made available, we&#039;ll announce it and change the links on the site.

Almost everything about the Hugo Awards is actually run by individual Worldcon committees, not by a central authority. All we can do here is maintain the lists of winners and finalists and serve as a historical clearinghouse for data. Next year&#039;s Hugo Awards will be administered by the 2016 Worldcon, MidAmericon II, and they will be responsible for the administration of the Awards, the organization of the ceremony, and any live video streaming and recordings of the ceremony. TheHugoAwards.org provides the text-only CoverItLive webcast only.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to believe that those who have spoiled their ballots will be in the majority, and that the WorldCon organizers will have the good sense and courage to make a statement against these reactionary arseholes. 
  Not going to happen though, is it? 
The Hugo awards used to mean something. They use to mean that, at the very least, the nominees would would be an interesting read or a worthwhile watch. Now they are forever tainted by a bunch of Conservative imbeciles. Well done guys. You have degraded the mediums you represent, you are a blight on fandom and you are an embarrassment to yourselves.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What the hell is this crap about a puppy group controlling the nominations this year? Just the attempt (now success) has fouled the winners awards this year, deserving or not. If those who control the Hugo&#039;s have any integrity they will correct this situation. Damn right wing conservatives are trying to rule everybody&#039;s minds, reminds me of 1984.

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] As most of you will know, on Saturday night I will be helping Kevin and Mur Lafferty co-host the text-based coverage of the Hugo Award Ceremony. Because of my travel plans, I&#8217;ll actually be doing this from a hotel room in Liverpool. The ceremony starts at 4:00am my time. Ouch. You can find information about how to watch the coverage here. [&#8230;]]]></description>
