					<description><![CDATA[The Worldcon organizers did a lot of great work with this years ceremonies. I wasn&#039;t able to attend, but I wish I could have.

The only minor oversight I noticed was announcing &quot;no award&quot; winning at the ceremony. It seemed like categories that went to no award should have been announced earlier.  This way, the nominees, their families, and their supporters didn&#039;t need to show up to the ceremony just to be ridiculed like that. To me, it was somewhat malicious and cruel to present no award the way it was done. Announcing no award wins before the ceremony and then filling in with something fun would be more tactful.]]></description>
