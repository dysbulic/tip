					<description><![CDATA[To elaborate, each year&#039;s Hugo Awards are administered by the individual Worldcon committee hosting that year&#039;s Awards. Those Worldcons generally set up a Hugo Administration Subcommittee, which has complete authority over the administration of the Awards that year within the WSFS rules. That means a different group (sometimes with members who have done the tasks before) runs it every year.

TheHugoAwards.org is managed by the Hugo Awards Marketing Committee, which is chartered by the WSFS Mark Protection Committee, owner of the service marks on &quot;Hugo Award,&quot; &quot;Worldcon,&quot; etc. Our job is to maintain a central information clearinghouse and to support the individual Worldcon committees, but we do not run the Awards ourselves.]]></description>

The Hugo Award Administrators have asked us to not say anything until they are ready to issue a statement, and we are respecting their request.

					<description><![CDATA[Will never take this event seriously again. Not until you get your voting system fixed. After all, when a right-wing pack of authors manages to dominate the awards by cheating, what point is there even having the Hugo Awards.
