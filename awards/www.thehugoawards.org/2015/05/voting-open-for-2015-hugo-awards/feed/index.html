					<description><![CDATA[They seem to have my address alright - I got the original registration emails, and the pin recovery mail.

This site I only found by searching via Google for anything related to the packet. I don&#039;t remember seeing any obvious hint on the main site. But then, it is somewhat hard to find things there. Furthermore, it feels seriously overloaded - so much I was asking myself if there was a DOS going on.

Now that I know this site here exists, I&#039;ll certainly follow it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You may want to contact Sasquan to make sure that they have your correct e-mail address.

We announced that voting had started here as you have seen. To stay in touch with announcements from TheHugoAwards.org, you can follow us on Twitter, Facebook, or subscribe to our RSS feed. (Links to these are on the sidebar to the right of the page under &quot;Follow Us.&quot;)

The Hugo Voter Packet has not yet been released. Preparing this packet is a very complicated process, requiring negotiation with all of the rights holders to obtain the right to distribute copies of their works to the voters. When the Packet is released, we will make an announcement here. (That&#039;s another reason you may want to follow us, as above.)

The Hugo Awards web site does not prepare or distribute the Hugo Voter Packet. The HVP is organized by each individual Worldcon. There is no guarantee that every finalist will be in the HVP. It is up to the individual rights holders to decide whether to share their works with the voters. The HVP is also not a guaranteed document required by WSFS rules. It is up to each individual Worldcon to decide whether it will continue to do the work necessary to prepare the package.

For further questions about this year&#039;s Hugo Voter Packet, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hugoadmin@sasquan.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2015 Hugo Award Administrators&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So ... I only found out accidentally from reading Blog comments that voting has started - the promised email seems to have vanished down some black hole somewhere. I finally managed to figure out how to get the voting number and PIN.

Now ... how do I get the instructions for downloading the packet?]]></description>
