					<description><![CDATA[Gary: I expect Kate (the relevant Administrator here) will have the post made soon, and as you noted in another comment, other people have posted the full text of the announcements. Note that the CoverItLive coverage was in fact &quot;mere low-bandwidth text&quot; and was not &quot;online video streaming,&quot; although that was also available if you wanted it. Perhaps you didn&#039;t realize that the live coverage provided through our web site is not a video and doesn&#039;t really require a very high-bandwidth connection to view. Indeed, as I was on a pretty low-bandwidth connection helping do the comment moderation on the CIL coverage, I&#039;m quite glad that it &lt;em&gt;wasn&#039;t&lt;/em&gt; necessary to have streaming video to watch the results come in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The 2011 Hugo Finalist announcement and live blogging coverage will begin at 2pm PDT / 10pm BST.&quot;

Very exciting.  But since it&#039;s now over, maybe someone could be bothered to provide a written list for those of us for whom streaming isn&#039;t a great or usable thing?

It&#039;s actually rather quick to post nominees names as they&#039;re spoken.  Alternatively, you could make most people wait for hours and hours to find out, and direct them to a video they might not have access to, instead.

I&#039;m not clear what the logic is in that decision: to make things more dramatically frustrating and uninformative and delayed?  But it&#039;s obviously one way to go.  

Unless one assumes that everyone online has instant access to online video streaming, and prefers it to mere low-bandwidth text.  Which, again, is certainly one way to go.  

I&#039;d put this commnent on the relevant entries, but comments on them are closed.]]></description>
