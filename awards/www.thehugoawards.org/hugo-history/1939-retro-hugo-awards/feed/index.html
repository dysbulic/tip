					<description><![CDATA[Water under the bridge now, of course, but I find it a bit amusing that the winning short story (Clarke&#039;s &quot;How We Went to Mars&quot;) appeared in my father&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Amateur Science Stories&lt;/i&gt; and yet it was his (my dad&#039;s) &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow&lt;/i&gt; which was nominated for Best Fanzine (which, unsurprisingly, went to Forry Ackerman&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Imagination!&lt;/i&gt;).

 Perhaps &lt;i&gt;A.S.S.&lt;/i&gt; (unfortunate acronym, that) didn&#039;t qualify as a fanzine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Dad suggested a story for me to read years ago that I think was written in the 30&#039;s. I don&#039;t remember the title or the author, but it was a story of a blind minstrel or poet that hooked rides planet to planet, telling stories in exchange for passage. On his last trip there was a reactor malfunction and he saves the ship by exposing himself to the radiation.
Anyone know the story or the author.
Thank you]]></description>
