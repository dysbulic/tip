					<description><![CDATA[Prakash:

We do not comment on specific works or their &quot;chances.&quot; The way you make the ballot is to come to the attention of enough members of WSFS that they decide to nominate your work. Self-published authors have been finalists and have won the Hugo Award.

					<description><![CDATA[Jackie:

Yes, but remember that the publisher gets one nominating ballot, just like everyone else. The publisher can join the current Worldcon just like you and I can join it, and then the publisher can cast up to five nominations in each category just like you can I can, and the five works with the most nominating votes make the final ballot. The publisher can&#039;t put something on the final ballot all by him/herself &#8212; the work has to receive enough nominating votes.

Note that I&#039;m speaking of &quot;the publisher&quot; on the assumption that you mean an individual human called &quot;publisher.&quot; If by publisher you mean, &quot;The company or corporate entity publishing the work,&quot; then actually the publisher &lt;em&gt;can&#039;t&lt;/em&gt; nominate any works, because WSFS rules require that only &quot;natural persons,&quot; (that is, human beings, not corporate entities, clubs, unincorporated associations, etc.) can vote, and also restrict people to one set of votes per person, regardless of how many memberships that person has. So, for instance, you couldn&#039;t just go buy a hundred Worldcon memberships in your name and cast them all for your favored work; the administrator would disregard the duplicate nominations/votes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Robert: The specific dates change a bit each year because each year&#039;s award is administered by that year&#039;s Worldcon, and Worldcon can be on different dates. Generally speaking, nominating opens on January 1. You need to be a member of the current Worldcon (or have been a member of the previous Worldcon) by the end of January in order to nominate, but nominations are generally open until sometime in March. The nominations are announced and the final ballot released usually in April. Voting is usually open until sometime in July, with the results announced at the Worldcon, which is generally sometime between the first weekend of August and the first weekend of September.

For specific information about the 2011 Worldcon and their Hugo Awards and the exact dates for this year, see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.renovationsf.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Renovation web site&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>
