					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for letting me know! I guess it partly comes down to how one views the &quot;Best Series&quot; award -- I personally lean toward viewing it as a way of saying &quot;we think this series is worthy of recognition,&quot; and once you&#039;ve said that, you don&#039;t need to say it again. Letting a series win more than once, even with that proposed restriction in place, makes me feel like the award is more like &quot;Best Series That Had a New Installment This Year,&quot; and I&#039;m much less interested in that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad to see the possibility of an award recognizing a good series, but I hope the final wording includes the element that a series which wins becomes ineligible for nomination thereafter. Otherwise we may end up with a revolving-door situation where a handful of popular series win over and over again as their new installments come out.]]></description>
