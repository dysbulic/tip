          <title>Vamps</title>
          <p>There are people who can ¿pull youth? from other people if they are in particular states of mind. One of the situations that encourages this state is engagement in a concert. For this reason many of them work as support musicians and roadies.</p>
          <p>The term <q>to vamp</q> refers to a period when the audience's energy is directed toward (and more accessible to) the secondary performers.</p>
          <p>Vamps can <q>push</q> normals. Backstory lines trail a conflict between two+ covens of roadies travelling with tours.</p>

          <title>Legion</title>
          <p>Arrival of an interdimensional being who recontextualizes the Jesus v. Legion as a struggle between beings from a higher plane. There are an infinite number of planes and so when two of them that can reach across the planes are in the same plane it is a rarity. In the same way that I could touch a piece of paper in disperate places, they can reach through to multiple people. It wasn't Jesus the individual fighting Legion the horde of demons, it was <q>Jesus</q> the interdimensional being anchored mostly in Jesus of Nazareth, but also in his disciples and growing <q>ministry</q>.</p>
