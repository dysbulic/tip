    <p>The idea for this project is straightforward: replace our existing economic and political systems with almost completely transparent computer mediated versions. This takes the form of an organization which publishes all of its operations.</p>

    <p>The business model I am proposing is called an open market. All the actors in the marketplace publish everything non-consumer identifiable. Consumers control their own data and share it to their own or the market's benefit.</p>

    <p>The combination I want to start with is a chain of <a href="https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/labor">restaurants</a>/<a href="https://github.com/dhappy/housing">hostels</a>. Workers sign up for <a href="https://github.com/dhappy/tour">working tours</a> and the system recommends the appropriate housing, shifts and rate of pay to make it work.</p>

    <h1><cite>2025</cite></h1>

    <p><cite>2025</cite> is a show set five years in our future. There are five major systemic changes in progress:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Pentapartite Mind</strong>: The discovery that meomories and goals are stored differentially in the foreward and hindbrains, with an overarching "whole-brained" self, for a total of five "minds". Discovering whether these different selves register on bioelectrical devices is the work of the Reformed Scientologists who are not terribly covert attempt by the Gainaist Church to usurpt the Scientologists significant financial holdings and protected status.</li>
      <li><strong>Open Markets</strong>: A significant portion of businesses are making their operations public and the results being aggregated and analyzed is creating new efficiencies. Industy 4.0 where smart factories autonomously adapt to changing demands.</li>
      <li><stong>Working Tours</strong> Some plots of the show will follow a cadre of workers as they travel the globe fulfilling ad-hoc contracts. This could easily be a show within a show.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquid Democracy</strong>: Citizens have reliable digital identities. They are able to specify delegates for votes or topical categories. The Technoanarchist candidate is running on a platform of converting the executive and legislative processes to completely transparent digital ones â€” to be the last President of the United States.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reformed Scientology i.e. Gaianists</strong>: Actual scientists subvert and subsume the power structure of the Scientologist Church making it empirical, transparent, and donation-based. Much of the doctrine is replaced with Gaianism, which deifies life as Goddess. Part of the power structure of the Church is anonymous and conducted via pseudonyms. I've been imagining aspects of the induction process and theology:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Basic Amenities</strong>: Instead of providing guaranteed income, the goal is to make food and shelter available as pay-what-you-can. There are funding pools to make up what people can't pay. An applicant makes tithes to these via bitcoin and sends a signed claim to the Church.</li>
          <li><strong>Coordinated Networking</strong>: Algorithms organize meetings of people, experiences, and substances. They review each other and progress through some sort of power structure.</li>
          <li><strong>Automated Deprogramming</strong>: Eventually an applicant is invited to an extended event. I'm imagining a trip on a large boat.</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive Stabalization</strong>: Members of the church act as sensors and actuators for an AI tasked with reducing incidinces of unwanted violence. The system plans where to place infrastructure and populations to maximize stability.</li>
          <li><strong>A Day w/o Hunger</strong>: A <a href="http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2014/04/rationale-for-the-department-of-happiness/">personal description interface</a> is widdely available and the bulk of the food supply is interoperable. The stabalization AI is getting progressively closer to a day when there is no self-reported unwanted hunger.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
