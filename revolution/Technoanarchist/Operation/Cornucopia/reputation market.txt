reputation market

A system rules for defining and uniquely identifying the taxonomy of [[â¸®neoguilds]].

Integral parts of both [[virtual trade systems]] and [[research datapipes]].

Described stepwise by [Will Holcomb] in [[reputation market|2009]].

The process of reaching an initial (1.0) taxonomy.

Step #1. Participating individuals form a [[tipgroup|group]].

Step #2. That group chooses a [[collaborative taxonomy]] implementation, applicable parent taxonomy nodes, and an initial value for the approval threshold.

Step #3. Using the [[collaborative taxonomy]], the members vote on an initial layout.

Step #4. Members create self-signed [[?skill certificate?|skill certificates]] for characterisitcs within the taxonomy.

Step #5. Randomized pairings of interviews are conducted between individuals claiming to have the same skill.

Step #6. Each person in the pair releases [[?skill certificate?|certificates]] about the other's prowess in the domain and reputability as an individual.

Step #7. Probability distributions are generated for the likelihood the self-signed [[?skill certificate?]] is accurate.

Step #8. Members meeting [[dynamic threshold|thresholds]] for reputability vote if the taxonomy is sufficient.

Step #9. If it there is insufficient support to cross the [[dynamic threshold|acceptance threshold]], the process begins again at Step #1.

Step #10. Once the threshold is accepted, each node is designated as being in version 1.0.

Step #11. A set of equivalent unique identifiers can now be formed by tracing the location of a trait back to each of the [[root taxonomy|root taxonomies]].

Only the votes of individuals who are reputable members of all the parent taxonomies are counted in the establishment vote.

Parent taxonomies may vote on negations for anyone claiming to be operating within their specialization.

Increases in the primary version number are decided by vote of the reputable members.

Branches in the taxonomy may be called for by any group with over 25%.

At the point of a branch, groups are allowed to pick from the branch and trunk numbers in preference according to size.

The most commonly used characterisitic taxonomy at this point is: [[1d20.technoanarchy.org]].
