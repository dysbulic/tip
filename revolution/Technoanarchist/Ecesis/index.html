    <h1>Project Ecesis</h1>

    <p>Ecesis exists to support the technical work of the <a href="http://departmentofhappiness.org">Department of Happiness</a>. The DoH is a philosophical endeavor, Ecesis is where the rubber hits the road.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://departmentofhappiness.org/short_version.html">DoH plan</a> has several stages and there are a series of projects to eventually be completed. In brief, they are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://ideapool.sourceforge.net">Ideapool</a> &mdash; a peer-to-peer network for distributing and retrieving cryptograhically signed XML documents.</p>
        <p>There is a separation between the production and consumption of information. For example, if I am a blog writer, I release blog posts in an appropriate semantic markup (perhaps a combination of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023">Atom</a> and <a href="http://www.docbook.org">Docbook</a>). Users of the network will have placed subscription requests for specific documents on the network. My posts, along with any others would be delivered to them, aggregated and displayed.</p>
        <p>Much like with <a href="http://freenetproject.org">Freenet</a>, information is not required to have an authoritative source and may be cached to improve search efficiency. Unlike with Freenet, however, there is no guarantee of privacy, but instead a focus on verifiability.</p>
        <p>Project Timeframe:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Planning: November 2008 - January 2009</li>
          <li>Implementation: January 2009 - December 2009</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Templ &mdash; a <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> focused on providing efficient tools for creating web applications using XML aggregates from the ideapool.</p>
        <p>Project Timeframe: Starting January 2010</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>TagItAll &mdash; an application built on Templ to allow generate semantic associations between URIs in the Ideapool.</p>
        <p>The end result is a decrease in anonymity for those that choose to participate. When I am walking down the street, if my cell phone is broadcasting a particular ID then someone receiving that can retrieve from the ideapool everything that has been published about me.</p>
        <p>Project Timeframe: Starting January 2011</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Vdentity &mdash; a toolset for the retrial and factor balancing of semantic networks.</p>
        <p>The issue is that there will be lots of crap inserted into the pool. This crap will, very likely, follow specific patterns. The vdentity tools will be useful for people attempting to tease meaning out of these complex networks. With the development of the proper tools, the reliability of the system will improve and acceptance will increase.</p>
        <p>Project Timeframe: Starting May 2011</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Volunteerism &mdash; an application for businesses to use their branding power to certify the virtual identities of individuals.</p>
        <p>A system will be gamed in proportion to the rewards for cheating. One simple way to reduce this is to make the cost for the establishment of a vdentity time. Volunteer organizations will release co-signed documents certifying that a particular flesh and blood person worked a certain number of hours. The organization will have an incentive not to lie so as to gain volunteers, and the volunteer will have an investment in a particular identity which anyone in the network can comment on.</p>
        <p>Project Timeframe: Dependant on open-source community interest</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Open Research &mdash; collaborative document and brainstorming tools.</p>
        <p>One institution that stands to be massively improved through the use of modern technology is the structured development of human knowledge i.e. academia. The open research project would create the tools for academians to collaborate online and in doing so develop professional standing.</p>
        <p>The process will not only remove the arbitrality of much of modern admissions and pedigree process, but it will allow continual peer review for the entire process, not simply after the project is completed. Also, it will allow significantly more immediate and complex relationships between pieces of research than currently exist with the journal publication process.</p>
        <p>Project Timeframe: Dependant on open-source community interest</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Manna &mdash; crowdsource research funding tool.</p>
        <p>Since research requires money to buy materials and feed researchers, a collective pool will be formed which allows research ideas to compete for available funds with the focus on financing projects that serve to maximize the net increase in happiness in the world.</p>
        <p>Project Timeframe: Dependant on open-source community interest</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Anarchist Grill &mdash; interactive community machine learning research experiment in maximizing contentment.</p>
        <p>To the extent that a person can interact with the bar, they will have that ability. A feedback learning algorithm will be maximizing any axis that it can to provide the maximum entertainment for the patrons and collecting as much data as possible to improve.</p>
        <p>The business will be run as a profit-donation venture with all profits returning to the pool for funding other research endeavors.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
