To properly import the files into spotify simply open the "Spotify Playlist" text file adn copy the contents of the file to your clipborad.

Then open the spotiy application and click on "New Playlist", rename the playlist what you would like.

Finally simply click Control+V or Right click and Paste the copied text while spotify is open and it will auto-import the tracks into the currently open playlist. 


Done!
