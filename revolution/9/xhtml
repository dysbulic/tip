    <p>I believe that there are five partially physically disperate areas of my brain with five different "perspectives" on memories.</p>
    <p>I believe I am crafting five different aspects of a revolution with five different rewards.</p>
    <p>One facet that has taken a long time to absorb is this process has never taken place before and that it takes effort to make anything happen.</p>
    <p>I had theorized that it was like a fire burning. That various societal structures had different amounts of energy to maintain. When a more efficient structure comes out there is a release of the difference. It might look like a highly profitable market or a bunch of attention through social media.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, it's all about software. That story is primarily to set up the use cases and ascertain what information is pertinent.</p>

    <p>So what are the systems?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>M√Ømis:</b> A persistent store. The collection is a set of versioned repositories, so data is not lost as it evolves. Theoretically, these same commits should still be around in 10,000 years even if the primary content has long since evolved into something else.</p>
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>The Department of Happiness:</b> A software company. All work is to be billed even though there might not be money in the coffers. Unpaid work goes into a pool where incoming deposits are divided equally amongst all the outstanding accounts.</p>
        <p>Bids are created for single work cycles (an 8-hour day or whatever) with, ideally, a new developer picking up where the original coder left off to, at the least, review the new code and write tests.</p>
        <p>Development continues around the clock with developers building reputations based on how many of their changes are merged upstream. It seems like there needs to be an owner for a branch to make the final decisions on what is included. That or some sort of voting mechanism.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Stay:</b> A detailed map of the world from which areas are rented for personal use.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Census:</b> A realtime program where a citizen records their status and wants. This constant polling provides a whole new perspective on the population.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>All land is communally held and rented for short periods. People have access to high quality goods, but own relatively little. Travel is simple and expected. Time commitments are, for the most part, for concrete and relatively short periods.</p>
    <p>Animals are free to roam.</p>
