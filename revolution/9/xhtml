    <p>I believe that there are five partially physically disperate areas of my brain with five different perspectives on memories.</p>
    <p>I believe I am crafting five different aspects of a revolution with five different rewards.</p>
    <p>One facet that has taken a long time to absorb is this process has never taken place before and that it takes effort to make it happen.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Mïmis:</b> A persistent store. A service worker is given a permissible storage capacity and coordinates with the network to preserve all data.</p>
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>The Department of Happiness:</b> A software company. Work may be done where there is a pool of work done without recompense yet. As monetary transactions take place, payers can choose to put a percentage into the pool where it is evenly distributed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Stay:</b> A detailed map of the world from which areas are rented for personal use.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Census:</b> A realtime program where a citizen records their status and wants.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
