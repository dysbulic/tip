# The Technoanarchist Revolution

_The Revolution_ is a speculative fiction set in the near-term and describing the progression of society to one without war, homelessness, or hunger.

There are five aspects to the story:

* Gaianism: A religion founded on the definition of God as all life at any point in time. There is no higher consciousness directing events to an eventual positive goal. There is only us.

"Worship" consists of anything that improves the health of God in any of its aspects. Groups of living organisms form higher-order aspects of God.

* Technoanarchy: A political movement focused on using technology to maximize the control one has over the course of their life.

There is a strong focus on liberty and the right to self-determination. Thusly, the war on drugs doesn't exist, and there are multiple reliable outlets for a variety of substances.

Additionally, when the Technoanarchists came to power, we ceased all foreign aggression and focused heavily on deploying communications technologies and network infrastructure.

Also, all citizens have the option of a reliable cryptographic identity attested to by the government.

* Open Market: An economy where the entire supply chain is managed through [IOTA transactions](//iota.org/verticals/global-trade-supply-chains). Businesses operate transparently and the specifics about how everything is constructed is available to anyone to try and find new efficiencies and markets.

Funding Pools are another technology enabled by the supply chain transparency. Tithing to Gaianist Churches is in large part donations to pools of money that can be accessed by anyone for specific purposes. The pools stay full enough that no one has to worry about homelessness or hunger.

* The Pentapartite Mind: A psychological theory that there are high-level structures that preserve different perspectives on memories and dreams. These selves evidence themselves in response to the environment.

Personality development occurs in terms of integrations of these parts. There are several mechanisms for this integration, but one of the most enjoyable is so-called "transcendental orgasm". It is simply being sexually stimulated for an extended period without release. Deep regular breathing is focused on.

My theory is this state of arousal can allow parts of the brain that aren't usually simultaneously active to interoperate albeit not in their normal functioning state.

Specifically it is nearly impossible to use orgasm to reorganize the mind when masturbating. The physical coordination and focus keep too much of the brain engaged in traditional ways. It needs to be stimulation by another party.
