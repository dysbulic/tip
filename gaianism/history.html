    <h1>The Rationale for a Church</h1>

    <p>I want to live in a theocracy. I want all the land to be held by a Church. An atheistic Church growing out of the Christian tradition, but positing that the Holy Spirit is a cognitive mode rather than the manifestation of an external deity.</p>

    <p>One explanation is that different modes inhabit the body as separate regions of the brain and different configurations of persistent muscular tension.</p>

    <p>It is an attempt to fill what is seen as much needed social organization to accompany an anarchist political system.</p>

    <p>My priorities are the ends of war, homelessness, and hunger. My plan is to offer a public alternative to Amazon. Everyone gets a wage, and everything beyond that goes into various funding pools â€“ proportions to be decided by the congregation.</p>

    <p>It helps to know that another person is familiar with your basic moral tenants and, if not agrees, at least respects them. That's only really possible on a large scale if the tenants are simple and enunciated.</p>

    <p>Thus, <a href='commandments/'>ten commandments</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm not attached to many of those, but I think it needs to be a set of either five, ten, or thirteen. Something, anything, so long as an interested party will likely not find it objectionable.</p>

    <p>There also needs to be a credo. Something a believer could memorize and say as a group as opening or closing a service. "I believe that I have a pentapartite mind. I am constituted of selves housed in disparate parts of my brain and body. I believe in the Spirit. I believe I can allow that self to guide me. I believe all people can."</p>

    <p>A greeting ritual might be to touch in some way and each side take at least one silent breath.</p>

    <p>We need an alternative to the police. Someone to call when you might need restraintive force or want a cameraperson.</p>

    <p>Rebel "Police" don't have a single jail where they take people. They find a permissible place where the person can be left and take them there.</p>

    <p>Depending on the person's condition and reason for being ejected from the last location and history, they might have to be taken to the woods or something.</p>

    <p>I want for property to be respected, but land is not property, it outlives an owner. I want for the Church to control it and everyone to be a part of the church.</p>

    <p>I want something with a clear set of guidelines for appropriate behavior and extreme permissiveness for anything not conscripted.</p>

    <p>A set of straightforward principles to build communities on. An ethical organization first and a commercial entity second.</p>

    <p>My initial goal </p>

    <p>I want the means of production to be controlled by distributed collectives. I want people to be able to proxy their votes into complex decision making networks.</p>

    <p>I want to lease spaces and guarantee that everyone has a space.</p>
