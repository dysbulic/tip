Author and lecturer Leo Buscaglia once talked about a contest he was
asked to judge. The purpose of the contest was to find the most 
caring child. The winner was a four year old child whose next door
neighbor was an elderly gentleman who had recently lost his wife. 
Upon seeing the man cry, the little boy went into the old gentleman's
yard, climbed onto his lap, and just sat there. When his mother
asked him what he had said to the neighbor, the little boy said,

"Nothing, I just helped him cry."
