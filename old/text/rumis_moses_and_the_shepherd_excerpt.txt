Here's a piece of another Rumi poem.... in the first part, Moses
castigates an humble shepherd for being too familiar and personal with
God, remonstrating that God is awesome and aloof and should be treated
with great awe and respect. The shepherd slinks away, feeling
reproved.

Then God speaks to Moses:
. . . . . . .
A sudden revelation came then to Moses.  God's voice:

                              You have separated me
from one of my own.  Did you come as a Prophet to unite,
or to sever?
                    I have given each being a separate and unique way
of seeing and knowing and saying that knowledge.

What seems wrong to you is right for him.
What is poison to one is honey to someone else.

Purity and impurity, sloth and diligence in worship,
these mean nothing to me.

                    I am apart from all of that.
Ways of worship are not to be ranked as better
or worse than one another.
                    Hindus do Hindu things.
The Dravidian Muslims in India do what they do.
It's all praise, and it's all right.

It's not me that's glorified in the acts of worship.
It's the worshippers!  I don't hear the words
they say, I look inside at the humility.

That broken-open lowliness is the reality,
not the language! Forget phraseology.
I want burning, burning.
                            Be friends
with your burning. Burn up your thinking
and your forms of expression!
                    Moses,
those who pay attention to ways of behaving
and speaking are one sort.
                    Lovers who burn
are another.
. . .
The love-religion has no code or doctrine.
                    Only God.
. . . . . . . . . . .
