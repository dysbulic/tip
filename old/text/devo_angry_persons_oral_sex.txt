A young fellow was about to be married and was asking his grandfather
about sex. He asked how often you should have it. His grandfather told
him that when you first get married, you want it all the time... and
maybe do it several times a day.

Later on, sex tapers off and you have it once a week or so. Then as
you get older, you have sex maybe once a month. When you get really
old, you are lucky to have it once a year..... maybe on your
anniversary.

The young fellow then asked his grandfather, "Well how about you and
Grandma now?"

His grandfather replied, "Oh, we just have oral sex now."

"What's oral sex?" the young fellow asked.

"Well," Grandpa said, "She goes to bed in her bedroom, and I go to bed
in my bedroom.... And she yells, 'Fuck You!!!!!' and I holler back,
'Fuck You too.'"
