     There's a moon in my body, but I can't see it!
     A moon and a sun.
     A drum never touched by hands, beating, and I can't hear it! 

     As long as a human being worries about when he will die,
      and what he has that is his,
      all of his works are zero.
     When affection for the I-creature and what it owns is dead,
      then the work of the Teacher is over.

     The purpose of labor is to learn;
      when you know it, the labor is over.
     The apple blossom exists to create fruit; when that
      comes, the petal falls.

     The musk is inside the deer, but the deer does not
      look for it:
      it wanders around looking for grass.
                                                Kabir
