My Mind

by Tongmyong (1901-1966)
1964 Korean poet.

My mind is a lake;
come and row your boat in it.
I will hug your white shadow
and break into jewels against your sides.
 
My mind is a candlelight:
please close the window for me.
will burn myself, quiet, to the last drop
trembling by your silken dress.

My mind is a wanderer;
play on your flute for me.
I will stay the quiet night through
listening to your tunes under the moon.

My mind is a falling leaf;
let me stay in your garden awhile.
I will leave you as a lonely wanderer
when the wind rises again.
