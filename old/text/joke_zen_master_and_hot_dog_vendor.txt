    A Zen Story
   
     The Zen master steps up to the hot dog cart and says: "Make me one 
     with everything."
   
     The hot dog vendor fixes a hot dog and hands it to the Zen master, who 
     pays with a $20 bill.  The hot dog vendor puts the bill in the cash 
     drawer and closes the drawer.
   
     "Where's my change?" asks the Zen master.
   
     And the hot dog vendor responds, "Change must come from within."
