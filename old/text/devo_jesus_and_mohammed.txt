Between moments of dispensing wisdom, it seems that historical
religious leaders had also learned software programming.  One day, a
great contest was held to test their skills.  After days and days of
fierce competition, only two leaders remained for the last day's
event: Jesus and Mohammed.

the judge described the software application required for the final
test, and gave the signal to start writing cods.  The two contestants
feverishly typed away on their keyboards.  Routines, classes, applets
and applications flew by on their screens at incredible speeds. 
Windows, dialogs, and other intricate graphics began forming on their
monitors.  The clock showed that the contest would soon be finished.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightening flashed and the power went out.  After
a moment, it came back on-just in time for the clock to announce that
the last competition was over.  the judge asked the two contestants to
reveal their finished software.  Mohammed angrily said that he'd lost
it all in the power outage.  The judge turned to the other competitor. 
Jesus smiled, clicked a mouse, and a dazzling application appeared on
his screen.

After just a few moments, the judge was clearly impressed and declared
Jesus the victor.  when asked why the decision was made, the judge
pointed out the unique characteristic that set the winner apart from
all the other leaders: Jesus saves.

Have a great day.  Hope this gets to you.
