Dear Lord,

So far today, God, I've done all right. I haven't gossiped, haven't
lost my temper, haven't been greedy, grumpy, nasty, selfish, or
overindulgent. I'm really glad about that.

But in a few minutes, God, I'm going to get out of bed, and from then
on I'm probably going to need a lot more help.

Thank you,

Amen
