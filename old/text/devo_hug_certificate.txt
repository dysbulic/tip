  	 IF I COULD CATCH A RAINBOW ...
 		I WOULD DO IT JUST FOR YOU
  	AND SHARE WITH YOU ITS BEAUTY
 		ON THE DAYS YOU'RE FEELING BLUE...
   	IF I COULD BUILD A MOUNTAIN
 		YOU COULD CALL YOUR VERY OWN
   	A PLACE TO FIND SERENITY
 		A PLACE TO BE ALONE
 	IF I COULD TAKE YOUR TROUBLES
 		I WOULD TOSS THEM IN THE SEA
 	BUT ALL THESE THINGS I'M FINDING
         	ARE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME,
         I CANNOT BUILD A MOUNTAIN
                 OR CATCH A RAINBOW FAIR
 	BUT LET ME BE, WHAT I KNOW BEST
 		A FRIEND THAT'S ALWAYS THERE.
 
 This is a hug certificate. Send one to all of your friends you think
 deserve a hug. Be aware you are promising your friend a virtual hug and
 a real hug. There is no chain letter to this.  It just makes a person
 feel better.
 
 This one I am giving to you because you are a great friend of mine.
 Send this to your friends including the person who sent it to you!
