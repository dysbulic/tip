I've learned....

 *I've learned that it's not what happens to people that's important. 
 It's what they do about it.
 
 *I've learned that you can do something in an instant that will
 give you a heartache for life.
 
 *I've learned that no matter how thin you slice it, there are
 always two sides.
 
 *I've learned that it's taking me a long time to become the
 person I want to be.
 
 *I've learned that it's a lot easier to react than it is to think.
 
 *I've learned that you should always leave loved ones with loving
 words. It may be the last time you see them.
 
 *I've learned that you can keep going long after you think you
 can't.
 
 *I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, no matter
 how we feel.
 
 *I've learned that either you control your attitude or it
 controls you.
 
 *I've learned that sometimes I just need to be held.
 
 *I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a
 relationship is at first, the passion fades and there had better 
 be something else to take its place.
 
 *I've learned that heroes are the people who do what has to be
 done when it needs to be done, regardless of the consequences.
 
 *I've learned that learning to forgive takes practice.
 
 *I've learned that there are people who love you dearly, but just
 don't know how to show it.
 
 *I've learned that money is a lousy way of keeping score.
 
 *I've learned that my best friend and I can do anything or
 nothing and have the best time.
 
 *I've learned that sometimes the people you expect to kick you
 when you're down will be the ones to help you get back up.
 
 *I've learned that I'm getting more and more like my grandma, and
 I'm kinda happy about it.
 
 *I've learned that a Sunday, following a Saturday night of
 drinking more than twelve mixed shots of hard liquor, is best spent in
 bed.
 
 *I've learned that sometimes when I'm angry I have the right to
 be angry, but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel.
 
 *I've learned that true friendship continues to grow, even over
 the longest distance. Same goes for true love.
 
 *I've learned that just because someone doesn't love you the way
 you want them to doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.
 
 *I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people just
 don't care back.
 
 *I've learned that maturity has more to do with what types of
 experiences you've had and what you've learned from them and less to
 do with how many birthdays you've celebrated.
 
 *I've learned that you should never tell a child her dreams are
 unlikely or outlandish. Few things are more humiliating, and what a
 tragedy it would be if she believed it.
 
 *I've learned that your family won't always be there for you. It
 may seem funny, but people you aren't related to can take care of you
 and love you and teach you to trust people again. Families aren't
 biological.
 
 *I've learned that no matter how good a friend someone is,
 they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive
 them for that.
 
 *I've learned that it isn't always enough to be forgiven by
 others. Sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself.
 
 *I've learned that no matter how bad your heart is broken the
 world doesn't stop for your grief.
 
 *I've learned that our background and circumstances may have
 influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.
 
 *I've learned that sometimes when my friends fight, I'm forced to
 choose sides even when I don't want to.
 
 *I've learned that just because two people argue, it doesn't mean
 they don't love each other. And just because they don't argue, it
 doesn't mean they do love each other.
 
 *I've learned that sometimes you have to put the individual ahead
 of their actions.
 
 *I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and only
 seconds to destroy it.
 
 *I've learned that we don't have to change friends if we
 understand that friends change.
 
 *I've learned that if you don't want to forget something, stick
 it in your underwear drawer.
 
 *I've learned that you shouldn't be so eager to find out a
 secret. It could change your life forever.
 
 *I've learned that the clothes I like best are the ones with the
 most holes in them.
 
 *I've learned that it's not what you have in your life, but who
 you have in your life that counts.
 
 *I've learned that two people can look at the exact same thing
 and see something totally different.
 
 *I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can
 do is be someone who can be loved. The rest is up to them.
 
 *I've learned that no matter how you try to protect your
 children, they will eventually get hurt and you will hurt in the
 process.
 
 *I've learned that there are many ways of falling and staying in
 love.
 
 *I've learned that no matter the consequences, those who are
 honest with themselves, get farther in life.
 
 *I've learned that many things can be powered by the mind, the
 trick is self-control.

 them most.
 
 *I've learned that your life can be changed in a matter of hours
 by people who don't even know you.
 
 *I've learned that even when you think you have no more to give,
 when a friend cries out to you, you will find the strength to help.

 emotional pains.

 offered to us.
 
 *I've learned that credentials on the wall do not make you a
 decent human being.
 
 *I've learned that the people you care most about in life are
 taken from you too soon.
 
 *I've learned that although the word "love" can have many
 different meanings, it loses value when overly used.
 
 *I've learned that it's hard to determine where to draw the line
 between being nice and not hurting people's feelings and standing up
 for what you believe.
