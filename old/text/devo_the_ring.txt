  Class Ring
 
  Close by the door he passed to stand
  as he took the class ring off her hand 
  all who were watching didn't dare speak
  as a silent tear ran down his cheek
  all through his mind, memories ran
  of the times they laughed and walked hand in hand
  but now her eyes looked very cold 
  he'd never have her again, never to hold
  all were silent as he bent down near
  to whisper "I love you" in her ear
  in touching her face, he started to cry
  he put on his "class ring" and wanted to die
  and just as the wind began to blow,
  they lowered her casket into the snow

 
Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell them.
Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what
they mean to you. Because when you decide that it is the right time,
it might be too late.


Seize the day. Never have regrets.

Most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have
helped make you the person that you are today.

Pass this along to your friends.

It could make a difference.

The difference between doing all that you can or having regrets which
may stay with you forever.
