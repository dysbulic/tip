Namaste, loosely translated, means "I love, honor and                         
respect the light and the life and the love that is within you."              
                                                                              
Another translation is "I honor the place in you in which the entire universe 
dwells.  I honor the place in you which is of love, of truth, of light and of 
peace.  When you are in that place in you and I am in that place in me, We    
are One."                                                                     
                    
i see this as saluting the Beautiful Soul in another being.
