"..and be content with such things as ye have...Hebrews 13:5"


A stonecutter once delivered a slab of stone to a merchant.  Seeing all his
wonderful goods, he said,  "I wish I was a merchant and had such things."  In
the twinkling of an eye, his wish was granted.  Then one day he saw a parade
pass by his store window.  He saw a prince pass by in splendor and he said, "I
wish I was a prince."  And immediately he became a prince...until the day the
hot sun beat down on him and he said, "I wish I was the sun, greater than any
man."  And he became the sun and was happy ...until a cloud came between him
and the earth.  He said, "That cloud over-shadows me.  I wish I was a cloud." 
Again his wish was granted.  He rained down on the earth to his heart's content
until he came to a mountain, which wouldn't let him pass.  He said, "That
mountain is greater than I, I wish I was a mountain."  Instantly, he became a
mountain and he thought, Now I am the greatest of all.  But one day a little
man climbed up the mountain and with a hammer and chisel began to tap away at
it.  The mountain, unable to stop him, said, "That little man is greater than
I, I wish I was a man who cut stone."  Once again his wish was granted and he
became a stone cutter.  He lived a long and useful life and everyone marveled
at how happy he was.
