A friend is...

Someone who will give you the last cookie
    when they haven't eaten all day.
Someone who is there to listen to you
    even when they have so much to say.
Someone who will choose you even when
    the world says you are wrong.
Someone who can take you anywhere and 
    make you feel that you belong.
Someone with whom you can say nothing
    and have comfort abound.
Someone who is there when you fall
    to lift you from the ground.
Someone who will tell you honestly
    when you aren't doing what you might.
Someone who will who will forgive you after
    your knock down drag out fight.
Someone who will follow you wherever
    you think you need to go.
Someone who needs no reason why, that it
    is for you is all they need know.
Someone who is excited about your victory,
    not caring about their second place.
Someone who will forget about their needs,
    to help you train for the race.
Someone with whom your secrets are safe,
    never to be forgotten or told.
Someone who likes you for who you are, though
    you are different from the mold.
Someone who will stand by you,
    even when you're down.
Someone who can find a smile, where
    all you do is frown.
Someone who respects you for you
    and knows who you are.
Someone whose influence lets you be you,
    whether they be near or far.
Someone who inspires you each day
    to make you want to be
Someone who in friends, yourself
    reflected you can see.

These attributes are what a friend should be,
    A gift more valuable than gold.
But the final test to find that friend so true,
    Is the story that is often told:
A friend is someone who can stand
    and look you in the eye.
And tell you from their heart sincere
    that they for you would die.
Though the time may never come
    to take that final test;
You know your true friend so faced
    Would stand among the best.
