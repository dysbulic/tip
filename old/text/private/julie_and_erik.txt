::walks to the boat/bed::
::looks around the empty opera house::
::sighs again and sits::
::listens to the fading echo of her sigh::
::glances sadly at the Phantom's throne::

::sings softly::
Angel of Music guide and guardian,
   grant to me your glory.
      Angel of Music hide no longer.
         Come to me strange angel.
::waits::

::jumps at the sound of a step::

Who's there?

<E>Don't be frightened. 

::glances around trying to locate the voice::

Who are you?

<E>You already know the answer

::gasps::
That's impossible. It's just a story.

<E>All stories have truths behind them

Where are you? Show yourself!

<E>Are you that unbelieving in me?

No I just don't want to get my hopes up.

::hears a sigh::
It's madamoiselle, thank you.

::watches a figure step from the wings::
<E>Pardon me, madamoiselle. 

::sits up quickly::
Oh...it really is you. Why are you here?

<E>I could ask the same of you my dear.

::becomes slightly angry::
This is my fantasy!

<E>You wanted me here

::the figure moves closer::
So? This isn't real.

<E>It can be if you wish it.

::closes her eyes in pain::
No it can't. I've tried so much.

::feels a gloved hand on her cheek::

<E>Try again

::pulls away and stands::
No! I can't do this again!
I can't live in a dream!

<E>What dream? I am quite real.

No you're not. I wish you were...but I can't do this.

<E>I have finally come for you

I know but I can't go with you

<E>You want to. Come with me

::places a hand on her shoulder::

I have a life out there

::gestures toward the door::

::places her hand over his::

But I can't go. Look at me, I'm fighting with myself.

<E>Stop fighting. Give in.

::spins and screams::
No! I am stronger than that!

<E>If you are so strong, why are you still here? Leave then.

::walks to the edge of stage::

This is my dream.
And so are you.
I want to find you in real life.
But for now, this is my dream.

<E>Live in it now. I can keep you happy.

Only in my mind. Can you hold me at night?

<E>Of course.

No! Only in my mind.

::walks to center of stage::

<E>Your mind can give you everything.

My mind is a cage and I have found the bars that keep me from leaving.

::watches him move closer::

<E>And so you pull back. But in here you are safe.

In here I am in more danger.

<E>Let me help you.

Help me?
::laughs::
How?

<E>If you stay with me part of the time-

::interrupts::

what? In here?

<E>Yes. I will always be here in case you come back.

::is undecided::
                
I don't know...
