Well, here is the first on paper conversation that I had with myself. 
::sighs:: J'ai faim
::walks to the boat/bed::  ::looks around the empty opera house::  ::sighs
again and sits::   ::listens to the fading echo of her sigh::  ::glances sadly
at the Phantom's throne::  ::sings softly::
Angel of Music guide and guardian, grant to me your glory. Angel of Music hide
no longer. Come to me strange angel. ::waits::  ::jumps at the sound of a
step::  Who's there?
<E>Don't be frightened. 
::glances around trying to locate the voice:: Who are you?
<E>You already know the answer
::gasps:: That's impossible. It's just a story.
<E>All stories have truths behind them
Where are you? Show yourself!
<E>Are you that unbelieving in me?
No I just don't want to get my hopes up.  ::hears a sigh::
 (I'll finish in a sec) (())
It's madamoiselle, thank you. ::watches a figure step from the wings::
<E>Pardon me, madamoiselle. 
::sits up quickly::  Oh...it really is you. Why are you here?
<E>I could ask the same of you my dear.


Call me a vagabond and I'll smile. Call me a thief and I'll laugh. Call me a
liar and I'll feed you your liver.

::becomes slightly angry::  This is my fantasy!
<E>You wanted me here
::the figure moves closer::  So? This isn't real.
<E>It can be if you wish it.
::closes her eyes in pain::  No it can't. I've tried so much. ::feels a gloved
hand on her cheek::
<E>Try again
::pulls away and stands::  No! I can't do this again! I can't live in a dream!
<E>What dream? I am quite real.
No you're not. I wish you were...but I can't do this.
<E>I have finally come for you
I know but I can't go with you
<E>You want to. Come with me
::places a hand on her shoulder::  I have a life out there  ::gestures toward
the door::
<E>But this life is much more fulfilling
They need me  <E>I need you
(stupid interruptions. I will be back to finish this off in a minute. Sorry
it's taking so long. But laundry calls.) :) (())     Julie

Call me a vagabond and I'll smile. Call me a thief and I'll laugh. Call me a
liar and I'll feed you your liver.

::places her hand over his::  But I can't go. Look at me, I'm fighting with
myself.
<E>Stop fighting. Give in.
::spins and screams:: No! I am stronger than that!
<E>If you are so strong, why are you still here? Leave then.
::walks to the edge of stage:: This is my dream. And so are you. I want to find
you in real life. But for now, this is my dream.
<E>Live in it now. I can keep you happy. <me>Only in my mind. Can ou hold me at
night? <E>Of course. <me>No! Only in my mind. ::walks to center of stage:: 
<E>Your mind can give you everything. <me>My mind is a cage and I have found
the bars that keep me from leaving. ::watches him move closer:: <E>And so you
pull back. But in here you are safe. <me>In here I am in more danger. <E>Let me
help you. <me>Help me? ::laughs:: How? <E>If you stay with me part of the time-
::interrupts:: <me>what? In here? <E>Yes. I will always be here in case you
come back. ::is undecided:: <me>I don't know...
