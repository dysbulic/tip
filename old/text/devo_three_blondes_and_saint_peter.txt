Three blondes died and are at the pearly gates of heaven. St. Peter
tells them that they can enter the gates if they can answer one simple
question.

St. Peter asks the first blonde, "What is Easter?"

The blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November
when everyone gets together, eats turkey, and are thankful..."

"Wrong!," replies St. Peter, and proceeds to ask the second blonde the
same question, "What is Easter?"

The second blonde replies, "Easter is the holiday in December when we
put up a nice tree, exchange presents, and Celebrate the birth of
Jesus."

St. Peter looks at the second blonde, shakes his head in disgust,
tells her she's wrong, and then peers over his glasses at the third
blonde and asks, "What is Easter?"

The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St. Peter in the eyes,
"I know what Easter is."

"Oh?" says St. Peter, incredulously.

"Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish
celebration of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the
last supper and Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans
by one of his disciples. "The Romans took him to be crucified and he 
was stabbed in the side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung
on a cross with nails through his hands. He was buried in a nearby
cave which was sealed off by a large boulder."

St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

The third blonde continues, "Every year the boulder is moved aside so
that Jesus can come out...and, if he sees his shadow, there will be
six more weeks of winter.
