Here's a poem someone sent me the other day.  Hope you like it.

 There's A Reason
 --------------------
 
 For every pain
 That we must bear,
 For every burden
 Every care,
 There's a reason.
 
 For every grief
 That bows the head,
 For every teardrop
 That is shed,
 There's a reason.
 
 For every hurt,
 For every plight,
 Fore every lonely,
 Pain-racked night,
 There's a reason.
 
 But if we trust God,
 As we should,
 It all will work out
 For our good,
 HE KNOWS THE REASON.
