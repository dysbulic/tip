 A stuttering man finally decides to go to the doctor to see if his speech
 impediment can be cured. The doctor thoroughly examines the man and finally
 asks him to drop his pants.
 
 Out comes this gigantic dick and the doctor pronounces the root of the
 problem to be strain on the vocal chords from the effects of gravity being
 transmitted up to the neck area.
 
 The patient then asks, "wh-wh-at c-c-ca-an b-b-e d-d-done ab-b-bout-t-t
 i-i-t?" to which the doctor replies, "modern surgery can work miracles. We
 can replace your dick with one of normal size and the stuttering will
 disappear right after the operation."
 
 The patient eagerly agrees to the surgery, and as promised his stuttering
 disappears.
 
 About 3 months later the man returns to the doctor and complains, "doctor,
 I am grateful to you for having cured me, but my wife really misses a big
 dick, and rather than lose her I've decided to get my old dick back and
 live with stuttering for the rest of my life." The doctor then looks
 straight at the man and replies, "d-d- de-deal's a d-d-deal."
