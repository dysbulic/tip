One day a man named Joe was talking to God. He asked, "God, what's a minute
to you?" God replied, "Joe, a minute to me is a million years."
Then Joe asked, "God, what's a penny to you?" God replied, "A penny to me
is a million dollars."

So Joe asked, "God, can I have a penny?" And God replied, "In a minute."
