Imagine if, instead of cryptic, geeky text strings, your computer
produced equally unhelpful error messages in Haiku . . .

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

A file that big?

It might be very useful.

But now it is gone.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

The Web site you seek

cannot be located but

endless others exist

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

Chaos reigns within.

Reflect, repent, and reboot.

Order shall return.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

ABORTED effort:

Close all that you have.

You ask way too much.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

First snow, then silence.

This thousand dollar screen dies

so beautifully.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

With searching comes loss

and the presence of absence:

"My Novel" not found.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

The Tao that is seen

Is not the true Tao, until

You bring fresh toner.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

Windows NT crashed.

I am the Blue Screen of Death.

No one hears your screams.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

Stay the patient course

Of little worth is your ire

The network is down

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

A crash reduces

your expensive computer

to a simple stone.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

Yesterday it worked

Today it is not working

Windows is like that

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

Three things are certain:

Death, taxes, and lost data.

Guess which has occurred.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

You step in the stream,

but the water has moved on.

This page is not here.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

Out of memory.

We wish to hold the whole sky,

But we never will.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

Having been erased,

The document you're seeking

Must now be retyped.

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

Rather than a beep

Or a rude error message,

These words: "File not found."

 - - - - - - - - - - - -

Serious error.

All shortcuts have disappeared.

Screen. Mind. Both are blank.
