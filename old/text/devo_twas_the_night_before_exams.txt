A College Version of 'Twas the Night Before Christmas

       Twas the night before finals,
       And all through the college,
       The students were praying
       For last minute knowledge.

       Most were quite sleepy,
       But none touched their beds,
       While visions of essays danced in their heads.

       Out in the taverns,
       A few were still drinking,
       And hoping that liquor would loosen up their thinking.

       In my own apartment,
       I had been pacing,
       And dreading exams
       I soon would be facing.

       My roommate was speechless,
       His nose in his books,
       And my comments to him
       Drew unfriendly looks.

       I drained all the coffee,
       And brewed a new pot,
       No longer caring
       That my nerves were shot.

       I stared at my notes,
       But my thoughts were muddy,
       My eyes went ablur,
       I just couldn't study.

       "Some pizza might help,"
        I said with a shiver,
        But each place I called
        Refused to deliver.
        
       I'd nearly concluded
       That life was too cruel,
       With futures depending
       On grades had in school.

       When all of a sudden,
       Our door opened wide,
       And Patron Saint Put It Off
       Ambled inside.
       Her spirit was careless,
       Her manner was mellow,
       She started to bellow:

       "What kind of student
        Would make such a fuss,
        To toss back at teachers
        What they tossed at us?"

       "On Cliff Notes!
        On Crib Notes!
        On Last Year's Exams!
        On Wingit and Slingit,
        And Last Minute Crams!"

       Her message delivered,
       She vanished from sight,
       But we heard her laughing
       Outside in the night.

       "Your teachers have pegged you,
        So just do your best.
        Happy Finals to All,
        And to All, a good test."
