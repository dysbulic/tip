He is the real Sadhu, who can reveal 
        the form of the Formless to the vision of these eyes:
Who teaches the simple way of attaining Him,
        that is other than rites or ceremonies:
Who does not make you close the doors, 
        and hold the breath
        and renounce the world:
Who makes you perceive the Supreme Spirit 
        wherever the mind attaches itself:
Who teaches you to be still
        in the midst of all activities.
                       -- Kabir
