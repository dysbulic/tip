YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN IN COLLEGE TOO LONG WHEN...

* You consider McDonald's "real food"
* You actually like doing laundry at home
* 4:00 AM is still early on the weekends
* It starts getting late on the weeknights
* Two miles is not too far to walk for a party
* You wear dirty socks three times in a row and think nothing of it
* You'd rather clean than study
* "Oh fuck how did it get so late!" comes out of your mouth at least
     once a night
* Half the time you don't wake up in your own bed and it seems normal
* Minesweeper is more than a game it's a way of life
* You schedule your classes around sleep habits and soaps
* You know the pizza boy by name
* You go to sleep when it's light and get up when it's dark
* You live for getting mail
* Looking out the window is a form of entertainment
* Prank phone calls become funny again
* It feels weird to take a shower without shoes on
* Whole wars can take place, and you are clueless (no connection to
     the outside world)
* You start thinking and sounding like your roommate
* Blacklights and highlighters are the coolest things on earth
* Rearranging your room is your favorite pastime
* You find out milk crates had so many uses
* Wal-mart is the coolest store
* The weekend lasts from Thursday to Sunday, (or Wednesday morning to
     Tuesday night)
* You are sitting around making lists about how you know you've been
     in college too long
