                     True story (from Dartmouth):     

      A student comes to a young professor's office hours.  She
      
      glances down the hall, closes his door, kneels pleadingly.
                    
      "I would do *anything* to pass this exam."  She leans closer
        
      to him, flips back her hair, gazes meaningfully into his eyes.
        
      "I mean..." she whispers, "...I would do...*anything*."
                        
      He returns her gaze. "Anything?"
                
      "*Anything*."
                
      His voice softens. "*Anything*??"
                
      "*Anything*."
                
        	
      His voice turns to a whisper. "Would you...*study*?"
