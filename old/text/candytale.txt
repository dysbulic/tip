 It was another Payday, and I was tired of being Mr. Goodbar.  So I saw
 Miss Hershey standing behind the Powerhouse on the corner of Clark and
 Fifth Avenue, and I whipped out my Whopper and whispered, "Hey Sweetart,
 how'd you like to Krunch on my Big Hunk for a Million Dollar Bar?"
 
 Well, she immediately went down on my Tootsie Roll, and, Uno, it was
 like pure Almond Joy.  I couldn't help but grab her delicious Mounds
 'cause it was easy to see that this little Twix had the Red Hots.  It
 was all I could do to hold back a Snicker and a Krackle as my
 Butterfinger went up her tight little Kit Kat and she started to scream
 "Oh Henry, Oh Henry!"
 
 Soon she was fondling my Peter Paul and Zagnuts and I knew it wouldn't
 be long before I blew my Milkduds clear to Mars and gave her a taste
 of the old Milky Way.  She asked if I was into M&M, but I said "Hey
 Chiclet, no kinky stuff." I said "Look you little Reese Piece, don't
 be a Zero, be a Lifesaver.  Why don't you just take my Whatchamacallit
 and slip it up your Bit O'Honey?" (And what a piece of JuicyFruit she
 was, too).
 
 She screamed, "Oh Crackerjack, you're better than the Three
 Musketeers!"  as I rammed my Ding Dong up her Rocky Road and into her
 Peanut Butter Cup.  Well, I was givin' it to her Good 'n' Plenty, when
 all of the sudden...my Starburst!
 
 Yeah, as luck would have it, she started to grow a bit Chunky and
 complained of a Wrigley in her stomach.  Sure enough, nine months
 later, out popped............a Baby Ruth!
 
 So be careful what candy you eat ! ! !
