And now for the question of the day---is your computer 'male' or 'female'?  
	You decide!

As you are aware, ships have long been characterized as being female (e.g., 
	"Steady as she goes" or "She's listing to starboard, Captain!").

Recently, a group of computer scientists (all male) announced that computers 
	should also be referred to as being female.  Their reasons for drawing 
	this conclusion follows:

Five reasons to believe computers are female:

1.  No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.
2.  The native language they use to communicate with other computers is 
	incomprehensible to everyone else.
3.  The message "Bad command or file name" is about as informative as, "If
	you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm certainly not going to tell
	you."
4.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later 
	retrieval.
5.  As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half 
	your paycheck on accessories for it.

However, another group of computer scientists (all female) think that 
	computers should be referred to as if they were male.  Their reasons   
	follow:

1.  They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.
2.  They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they
	ARE the problem.
3.  As soon as you commit to one you realize that, if you had waited a little
	longer, you could have obtained a better model.
4.  In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.
5.  Big power surges knock them out for the rest of the night.
