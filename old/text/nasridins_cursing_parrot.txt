Nasrudin received a parrot for his birthday.  This parrot was fully
grown with a bad attitude and worse vocabulary. Every other word was
an expletive.  Those that weren't expletives were, to say the least
rude.

Nasrudin tried hard to change the bird's attitude and was constantly
saying polite words, playing soft music, anything he could think of
to try and set a good example...

Nothing worked. He yelled at the bird and the bird got worse. He
shook the bird and the bird got more angry and more rude.  Finally,
in a moment of desperation, Nasrudin put the parrot in the freezer.
For a few moments he heard the bird squawking, kicking, and
screaming - then suddenly there was quiet.

Nasrudin was frightened that he might have hurt the bird and quickly
opened the freezer door.  The parrot calmly stepped out onto
Nasrudin's extended arm and said: "I'm sorry that I might have
offended you with my language and action and I ask your forgiveness.
I will endeavor to correct my behavior."

Nasrudin was astonished at the bird's change in attitude and was
about to ask what had made such a dramatic change when the parrot
continued: "May I ask what the chicken did?"
