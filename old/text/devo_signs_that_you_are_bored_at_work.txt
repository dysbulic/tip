Signs you are bored at work

1. You've already read the entire Dilbert page-a-day calendar for 1999.

2. You discover that staring at your cubicle wall long enough produces
	images of Elvis.

3. You've figured out a way to get Gilligan off the island.

4. You decide to see how many Mountain Dews you can drink before the
	inevitable explosion occurs.

5. People come into your office only to borrow pencils from your ceiling.

6. No longer content with merely photocopying your butt, you now scan and
	enhance it with Photoshop.

7. You now require only a single can of cola to belch the names of all
	seven Dwarfs.

8. The 4th Division of Paper clips has overrun the Pushpin Infantry, and
	General White-Out has called for reinforcements.
