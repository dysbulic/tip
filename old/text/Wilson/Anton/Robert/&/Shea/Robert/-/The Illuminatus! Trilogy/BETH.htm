<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">THE 1LLUMINATI CIPHERS, CODES, AND
CALENDARS</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These following ciphers were found in the home of the lawyer Hans Zwack
during a raid by the Bavarian government in 1785. Letters from Weishaupt (signed
&quot;Spar-tacus&quot;), written in the code and outlining most of the plans of
the Illuminati, were also found, and led to the suppression of the Order, after
which it went underground and regrouped.</p>
<p>These cyphers are given (curiously, without their code names) in Daraul'S <i>History
of Secret Societies, </i>page 227. The purpose of the code names was to make
breaking the cypher more difficult. All messages begin in the Zwack cypher, but
the fifth word is always &quot;Weishaupt&quot; or &quot;DeMolay,&quot; and the
message then switches to whichever of these cyphers is thus indicated; whenever
either of these words (or &quot;Zwack&quot;) appears again, the system again
switches. Breaking the cypher by the usual statistical methods is, therefore,
virtually impossible, at least before the invention of the computer—for the
uninitiated cypher-breaker is confronted with, not 26, but 3 X 26, or 78,
separate symbols, whose regularity has little to do with the celebrated formula
(EATOINSHRDLU . . . etc.) for the regularity of the 26 letters.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* The reader should be reminded that a true <i>code
</i>can never be broken, although all <i>cyphers </i>always can be (given enough
time and manpower). A cypher has a serial, one-to-one correspondence with</span></p>

<p>In addition, any of the 78 symbols can be replaced by the abbreviation for
the corresponding Tarot card, thus further befuddling the uninitiated. The
Tarots are arranged in the sequence: Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles, Trumps.
Thus, the first symbol can be replaced by AcW (Ace of Wands), the second by 2W
(two of Wands), and so on, through Cups, Swords, and Pentacles. The last 22
symbols are represented by the 22 trumps: TF (The Fool), TM (The Magus), THP
(The High Priestess), and so forth. Since there are five groups in the Tarot
(the four suits and the trumps), and the alphabet is repeated only three times,
this leaves two null sets for transmission of Zen telegrams. &quot;Once you've
seen the Great Vision,&quot; Hagbard once said, &quot;you look at everything
else in life <i>twice.&quot;</i></p>
<p>The Illuminati calendars, finally, are all based on five seasons (due to the
Law of Fives.) The names of the seasons, their meanings, and the Christian
equivalents are as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything is dated from year 1 A.M. (Anno Mung), which is 4000 B.C. in the
Christian calendar—the year Hung Mung first perceived the Sacred Chao and
achieved illumination. Thus, Hassan i Sabbah founded the Hashishim in 5090 A.M.,
Weishaupt reformed the Illuminati in 5776 A.M., and—to take a year in the
middle of our novel— 1970 in the Christian calendar is, to the Illuminati,
5970 A.M., just as it is in the calendar used by Royal Arch masons. (The reader
can decide for himself whether this fact represents coincidence, complicity, or
synchronicity.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">but only the Illuminated can read the code
behind the cypher and know what (or who) the Rising Hodge is.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Illuminati date for anything is always a higher number than that in any
other calendar, since the Jews (and, oddly, the Scotch Rite masons) date
everything from 240 A.M., Confucians from 312 A.M., Christians from 4000 A.M.,
Moslems from 4580 etc. Only Bishop Usher, who dated everything from 4004 B.C.
(or -4 A.M.), produced an older starting point than the Illuminati.</p>
<p>For instance, here are some random dates as they appear on the Illuminati
system of reckoning:</p>
<p>First Egyptian dynasty 1100 A.M.</p>
<p>The Rig-Veda written 2790 A.M.</p>
<p>First Chou dynasty 3000 A.M.</p>
<p>Founding of Rome 3249 A.M.</p>
<p>Hassan Sabbah illuminated 5090 A.M.</p>
<p>Indians discover Columbus 5492 A.M. Pigasus nominated for</p>
<p>President of the U. S. 5968 A.M.</p>
<p>Returning to the yearly round, each of the five seasons is divided, of
course, into five months, thus producing a year of 5 X 5 or 25 months. The first
three months of every season (known as the tricycle) each have 15 days, which
fits the law of five because 1x5 = 5. The last two months of each season each
have 14 days, which also fits the law of fives because 1+4 = 5. Each season has
73 days, because (a) you <i>have to </i>get 73 when you divide 365 by 5; (b) 7 +
3 = 10, the first multiple of 5 after 5 itself; and (c) this corresponds, as Dr.
Ignotius pointed out in the novel, to the 73 parts of the Illuminati pyramid
(counting the Eye as a part). The last day of each season is known as Eye Day
and is celebrated in ways too foul to be mentioned in a book such as this,
intended for family entertainment.</p>
<p>The mystic 23 appears in the calendar in the following ways:</p>
<p>(1) The bicycle has 2 months and the tricycle has <i>3.</i></p>
<p>(2) The bicycle has 28 days (two months of 14 days each), and when you
subtract the all-important 5 this leaves, again, the mystic 23.</p>
<p>(3) When 5 is multiplied by its own first product, 10, the result is 50; and
when this, in turn, is subtracted from the days in a season, 73, the significant
23 once again appears.</p>
<p>(4) The tricycle has 45 days; add one for Leap Year's Day and you get
46—exactly 2 X 23.</p>
<p>(5) 2 + 3 of course equals the all-important 5, the number on which the
calendar is based and, even more significant, the number of this proof.</p>
<p>As Weishaupt said to Knigge after explaining all this, &quot;Could Aquinas do
better?&quot; (Actually, the mystic meaning of these numbers is sexual. The male
sex cycle is, as Tantrists know, 23 days; add the mystic five and you get 28
days, the female cycle. It's that simple. Or is it?)</p>
<p>The sanctification of the number 5 antedates Atlantis itself and goes back to
the intelligent cephalopods who infested Antarctica about 150,000,000 years
before humankind appeared on earth; see H.P. Lovecraft's work of
&quot;fiction,&quot; <i>At the Mountains of Madness </i>(Arkham House, 1968), in
which it is suggested that 5 was sacred to these creatures because they had five
tentacles or pseudopods. In this connection, the reader might find some food for
thought in a conversation which took place between Hag-bard Celine and Joe Malik
in the late autumn of 1980. Joe, at the time, had just received the Pulitzer
Prize. (He was also under investigation by a Congressional Committee, in
connection with the same achievement: publication of certain governmental
secrets.)</p>
<p><i>&quot;Five </i>of the Senators voted to cite me for contempt, for not
revealing my source,&quot; Joe said. &quot;Three voted against it. So I'll be
cited, and the Grand Jury will draw up an indictment. There's that Law of Fives
again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you worried?&quot; Hagbard asked, relaxing in one of the heavy
leather chairs that were part of <i>Confrontation's </i>new, more ornate
offices.</p>
<p>&quot;Hell, no. I can always seek sanctuary in Panama, or someplace, if they
convict me. And Peter can keep this operation going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're not afraid to start a new life as an exile?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe grinned. &quot;At my age, any new experience is an adventure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're doing fine,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;Here's your latest
revelation from the A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>A<i><span style="font-size:13.5pt">:.</span></i>
.&quot; He reached into his pocket and took out a photo of a female infant with
six fingers on each hand. &quot;Got this from a doctor friend at Johns
Hopkins.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe looked at it and said, &quot;So?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If we all looked like her, there'd be a Law of Sixes.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe stared at him. &quot;You mean, after all the evidence I collected, the
Law of Fives is an Illuminati put-on? You've been letting me delude
myself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all.&quot; Hagbard was most earnest. &quot;The Law of Fives is
perfectly true. Everybody from the JAMs to the Dealy Lama agrees on that. But
you have to understand it more deeply now, Joe. Correctly formulated, the Law
is: All phenomena are directly or indirectly related to the number five, and
this relationship can always be demonstrated, <i>given enough ingenuity on the
part of the demonstrator.&quot; </i>The evil grin flashed. &quot;That's the very
model of what a true scientific law must always be: a statement about how the
human mind relates to the cosmos. We can never make a statement about the cosmos
itself—<i>but only about how our senses (or our instruments) detect it, and
about how our codes and languages symbolize it. </i>That's the key to the
Einstein-Heisenberg revolution in physics, and to the Buddha's revolution in
psychology much earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Joe protested, &quot;everything fits the Law. The harder I
looked, the more things there were that fit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Think about that. If you need quick
transportation to Panama,&quot; he added, heading for the door, &quot;call Gold
and Appel Transfers and leave a message.&quot;</p>
