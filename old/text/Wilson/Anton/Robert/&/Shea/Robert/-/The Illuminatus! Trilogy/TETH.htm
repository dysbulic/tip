<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After prolonged pleading and vehement prayers of entreaty, the authors
finally prevailed upon Hagbard Celine to allow us to quote some further
illuminating passages from his booklet <i>Never Whistle While You're Pissing.* </i>(Before
we made these frantic efforts, he wanted us to publish the whole thing.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* The title, he informs us, is taken from R.
H. Blythe's <i>Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics. </i>The story is
instructive: Blythe, studying za-zen (sitting zen, or <i>dhyana </i>meditation)
in a monastery at Kyoto, asked the <i>roshi </i>(Zen Master) if there was any
further discipline he should adopt to accelerate his progress. The <i>roshi </i>replied,
concisely, &quot;Never whistle while you're pissing.&quot; Cf. Gurdjieff's
endless diatribes about &quot;concentration,&quot; the rajah in Huxley's <i>Island
</i>who unleashed talking mynah birds to remind his citizens constantly
&quot;Here and now, boys, here and now!&quot; and Jesus, &quot;Whatever thy hand
findest to do, do it with all thy heart.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Here, then, are some of the keys to the strange head of Hagbard Celine:</p>
<p>I once overheard two botanists arguing over a Damned Thing that had
blasphemously sprouted in a college yard. One claimed that the Damned Thing was
a tree and the other claimed that it was a shrub. They each had good scholarly
arguments, and they were still debating when I left them.</p>
<p>The world is forever spawning Damned Things—things that are neither tree
nor shrub, fish nor fowl, black nor white—and the categorical thinker can only
regard the spiky and buzzing world of sensory fact as a profound insult to his
card-index system of classifications. Worst of all are the facts which violate
&quot;common sense,&quot; that dreary bog of sullen prejudice and muddy inertia.
The whole history of science is the odyssey of a pixilated card-indexer
perpetually sailing between such Damned Things and desperately juggling his
classifications to fit them in, just as the history of politics is the futile
epic of a long series of attempts to line up the Damned Things and cajole them
to march in regiment.</p>
<p>Every ideology is a mental murder, a reduction of dynamic living processes to
static classifications, and every classification is a Damnation, just as every
inclusion is an exclusion. In a busy, buzzing universe where no two snow-flakes
are identical, and no two trees are identical, and no two people are
identical—and, indeed, the smallest subatomic particle, we are assured, is not
even identical with itself from one microsecond to the next—every card-index
system is a self-delusion. &quot;Or, to put it more charitably,&quot; as
Nietzsche says, &quot;we are all better artists than we realize.&quot;</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the label &quot;Jew&quot; was a Damnation in Nazi
Germany, but actually the label &quot;Jew&quot; is a Damnation anywhere, even
where anti-Semitism does not exist. &quot;He is a Jew,&quot; &quot;He is a
doctor,&quot; and &quot;He is a poet&quot; mean, to the card-indexing center of
the cortex, that my experience with him will be like my experience with other
Jews, other doctors, and other poets. Thus, individuality is ignored when
identity is asserted.</p>
<p>At a party or any place where strangers meet, watch this mechanism in action.
Behind the friendly overtures there is wariness as each person fishes for the
label that will identify and Damn the other. Finally, it is revealed: &quot;Oh,
he's an advertising copywriter,&quot; &quot;Oh, he's an engine-lathe
operator.&quot; Both parties relax, for now they know how to behave, what roles
to play in the game. Ninety-nine percent of each has been Damned; the other is
reacting to the 1 percent that has been labeled by the card-index machine.</p>
<p>Certain Damnations are socially and intellectually necessary, of course. A
custard pie thrown in a comedian's face is Damned by the physicist who analyzes
it according to the Newtonian laws of motion. These equations tell us all we
want to know about the impact of the pie on the face, but nothing about the
human meaning of the pie-throwing. A cultural anthropologist, analyzing the
social function of the comedian as shaman, court jester, and king's surrogate,
explains the pie-throwing as a survival of the Feast of Fools and the killing of
the king's double. This Damns the subject in another way. A psychoanalyst,
finding an Oedipal castration ritual here, has performed a third Damnation, and
the Marxist, seeing an outlet for the worker's repressed rage against the
bosses, performs a fourth. Each Damnation has its values and its uses, but it is
nonetheless a Damnation <i>unless its partial and arbitrary nature is
recognized.</i></p>
<p>The poet, who compares the pie in the comedian's face with the Decline of the
West or his own lost love, commits a fifth Damnation, but in this case the game
element and whimsicality of the symbolism are safely obvious. At least, one
would hope so; reading the New Critics occasionally raises doubts on this point.</p>
<p>Human society can be structured either according to the principle of
authority or according to the principle of liberty. Authority is a static social
configuration in which people act as superiors and inferiors: a sadomasochistic
relationship. Liberty is a dynamic social configuration in which people act as
equals: an erotic relationship. In every interaction between people, either
Authority or Liberty is the dominant factor. Families, churches, lodges, clubs,
and corporations are either more authoritarian than libertarian or more
libertarian than authoritarian.</p>
<p>It becomes obvious as we proceed that the most pugnacious and intolerant form
of authority is the State, which even today dares to assume an absolutism which
the Church itself has long ago surrendered and to enforce obedience with the
techniques of the Church's old and shameful Inquisition. Every form of
authoritarianism is, however, a small &quot;State,&quot; even if it has a
membership of only two. Freud's remark to the effect that the delusion of one
man is neurosis and the delusion of many men is religion can be generalized: The
authoritarianism of one man is crime and the authoritarianism of many men is the
State. Benjamin Tucker wrote quite accurately:</p>
<p>Aggression is simply another name for government. Aggression, invasion,
government are interchangeable terms. The essence of government is control, or
the attempt to control. He who attempts to control another is a governor, an
aggressor, an invader; and the nature of such invasion is not changed, whether
it be made by one man upon another man, after the manner of the ordinary
criminal, or by one man upon all other men, after the manner of an absolute
monarch, or by all other men upon one man, after the manner of a modern
democracy.</p>
<p>Tucker's use of the word &quot;invasion&quot; is remarkably precise,
considering that he wrote more than fifty years before the basic discoveries of
ethology. Every act of authority is, in fact, an invasion of the psychic and
physical territory of another.</p>
<p>Every fact of science was once Damned. Every invention was considered
impossible. Every discovery was a nervous shock to some orthodoxy. Every
artistic innovation was denounced as fraud and folly. The entire web of culture
and &quot;progress,&quot; everything on earth that is manmade and not given to
us by nature, is the concrete manifestation of some man's refusal to bow to
Authority. We would own no more, know no more, and be no more than the first
apelike hominids if it were not for the rebellious, the recalcitrant, and the
intransigent. As Oscar Wilde truly said, &quot;Disobedience was man's Original
Virtue.&quot;</p>
<p>The human brain, which loves to read descriptions of itself as the universe's
most marvelous organ of perception, is an even more marvelous organ of
rejection. The naked facts of our economic game, are easily discoverable and
undeniable once stated, but conservatives—who are usually individuals who
profit every day of their lives from these facts—manage to remain oblivious to
them, or to see them through a very rosy-tinted and distorting lens. (Similarly,
the revolutionary ignores the total testimony of history about the natural
course of revolution, through violence, to chaos, back to the starting point)</p>
<p>We must remember that <i>thought is abstraction. </i>In Einstein's metaphor,
the relationship between a physical fact and our mental reception of that fact
is not like the relationship between beef and beef-broth, a simple matter of
extraction and condensation; rather, as Einstein goes on, it is like the
relationship between our overcoat and the ticket given us when we check our
overcoat. In other words, human perception involves <i>coding </i>even more than
crude <i>sensing. </i>The mesh of language, or of mathematics, or of a</p>
<p>school of art, or of any system of human abstracting, gives to our mental
constructs the structure, not of the original fact, but of the symbol system
into which it is coded, just as a map-maker colors a nation purple not because
it <i>is </i>purple but because his code demands it. But every code excludes
certain things, blurs other things, and overemphasizes still other things.
Nijinski's celebrated leap through the window at the climax of <i>Le Spectre
d'une Rose </i>is best coded in the ballet notation system used by
choreographers; verbal language falters badly in attempting to convey it;
painting or sculpture could capture totally the magic of one instant, but one
instant only, of it; the physicist's equation, Force = Mass X Acceleration,
highlights one aspect of it missed by all these other codes, but loses
everything else about it. Every perception-is influenced, formed, and structured
by the habitual coding habits—mental game habits—of the perceiver.</p>
<p>All authority is a function of coding, of game rules. Men have arisen again
and again armed with pitchforks to fight armies with cannon; men have also
submitted docilely to the weakest and most tottery oppressors. It all depends on
the extent to which coding distorts perception and conditions the physical (and
mental) reflexes.</p>
<p>It seems at first glance that authority could not exist at all if all men
were cowards or if no men were cowards, but flourishes as it does only because
most men are cowards and some men are thieves. Actually, the inner dynamics of
cowardice and submission on the one hand and of heroism and rebellion on the
other are seldom consciously realized either by the ruling class or the servile
class. Submission is identified not with cowardice but with virtue, rebellion
not with heroism but with evil. To the Roman slave-owners, Spartacus was not a
hero and the obedient slaves were not cowards; Spartacus was a villain and the
obedient slaves were virtuous. The obedient slaves believed this also. The
obedient always think of themselves as virtuous rather than cowardly.</p>
<p>If authority implies submission, liberation implies equality; authority
exists when one man obeys another, and liberty exists when men do not obey other
men. Thus, to say that authority exists is to say that class and caste exist,
that submission and inequality exist. To say that liberty exists is to say that
classlessness exists, to say that brotherhood and equality exist.</p>
<p>Authority, by dividing men into classes, creates dichotomy, disruption,
hostility, fear, disunion. Liberty, by placing men on an equal footing, creates
assocation, amalgamation, union, security. When the relationships between men
are based on authority and coercion, they are driven apart; when based on
liberty and nonaggression, they are drawn together.</p>
<p>There facts are self-evident and axiomatic. If authoritarianism did not
possess the in-built, preprogrammed double-bind structure of a Game Without End,
men would long ago have rejected it and embraced libertarianism.</p>
<p>The usual pacifist complaint about war, that young men are led to death by
old men who sit at home manning bureaucrat's desks and taking no risks
themselves, misses the point entirely. Demands that the old should be drafted to
fight their own wars, or that the leaders of the waning nations should be sent
to the front lines on the first day of battle, etc., are aimed at an assumed
&quot;sense of justice&quot; that simply does not exist. To the typical
submissive citizen of authoritarian society, it is normal, obvious, and
&quot;natural&quot; that he should obey older and more dominant males, even at
the risk of his life, even against his own kindred, and even in causes that are
unjust or absurd.</p>
<p>&quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;—<i>the </i>story of a group of
young males led to their death in a palpably idiotic situation and only because
they obeyed a senseless order without stopping to think—has been, and remains,
a popular poem, because unthinking obedience by young males to older males is
the most highly prized of all conditioned reflexes within human, and hominid,
societies.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which authority and submission are implanted in the human
mind is coding of perception. That which fits into the code is accepted; all
else is Damned. It is Damned to being ignored, brushed aside, unnoticed, and—
if these fail—it is Damned to being forgotten.</p>
<p>A worse form of Damnation is reserved for those things which cannot be
ignored. These are daubed with the brain's projected prejudices until, encrusted
beyond recognition, they are capable of being fitted into the system,
classified, card-indexed, buried. This is what happens to every</p>
<p>Damned Thing which is too prickly and sticky to be excommunicated entirely.
As Josiah Warren remarked, &quot;It is dangerous to understand new things too
quickly.&quot; Almost always, we have not understood them. We have murdered them
and mummified their corpses.</p>
<p>A <i>monopoly on the means of communication </i>may define a ruling elite
more precisely man the celebrated Marxian formula of &quot;monopoly on the means
of production.&quot; Since man extends his nervous system through channels of
communication like the written word, the telephone, radio, etc., he who controls
these media controls part of the nervous system of every member of society. The
contents of these media become part of the contents of every individual's brain.</p>
<p>Thus, in pre-literate societies taboos on the spoken word are more numerous
and more Draconic than at any more complex level of social organization. With
the invention of written speech—hieroglyphic, ideographic, or alphabetical
—the taboos are shifted to this medium; there is less concern with what people
say and more concern with what they write. (Some of the first societies to
achieve literacy, such as Egypt and the Mayan culture of ancient Mexico,
evidently kept a knowledge of their hieroglyphs a religious secret which only
the higher orders of the priestly and royal families were allowed to share.) The
same process repeats endlessly: Each step forward in the technology of
communication is more heavily tabooed than the earlier steps. Thus, in America
today (post-Lenny Bruce), one seldom hears of convictions for spoken blasphemy
or obscenity; prosecution of books still continues, but higher courts
increasingly interpret the laws in a liberal fashion, and most writers feel
fairly confident that they can publish virtually anything; movies are growing
almost as desacralized as books, although the fight is still heated in this
area; television, the newest medium, remains encased in neolithic taboo. (When
the TV pundits committed <i>lese majeste </i>after an address by the then
Dominant Male, a certain Richard Nixon, one of his lieutenants quickly informed
them they had overstepped, and the whole tribe—except for the dissident
minority—cheered for the reasertion of tradition.) When a more efficient
medium arrives, the taboos on television will decrease.</p>
