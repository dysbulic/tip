<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">OPERATION MINDFUCK</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OM was originally instigated by Ho Chih Zen, of the Erisian Liberation Front,
who is the same person but not the same individual as Lord Omar Khayyam
Ravenhurst, author of <i>The Honest Book of Truth. </i>The guiding philosophy is
that originally proposed in <i>The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior </i>by
von Neumann and Morgenstern: namely, that the only strategy which an opponent
cannot predict is a random strategy. The foundation had already been laid by the
late Malaclypse the Younger, K.S.C., when he proclaimed, &quot;We Discordians
must stick apart.&quot; This radical decentralization of all Discordian
enterprises created a built-in random factor even before Operation Mind-fuck was
proposed. To this day, neither Ho Chih Zen himself nor any other Discordian
apostle knows for sure who is or is not involved in any phase of Operation
Mindfuck or what activities they are or are not engaged in as part of that
project. Thus, the outsider is immediately trapped in a double-bind: the only
safe assumption is that anything a Discordian does is somehow related to OM,
but, since this leads directly to paranoia, this is not a &quot;safe&quot;
assumption after all, and the &quot;risky&quot; hypothesis that whatever the
Discordians are doing is harmless may be &quot;safer&quot; in the long run,
perhaps. <i>Every aspect of OM follows, or accentuates, this double-bind.*</i></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* The double-bind, first defined by
anthropologist Gregory Bateson, is a situation in which you must choose between
two alternatives both of which are unpleasant. A beautiful example, suggested by
Mr. William S. Burroughs: Condition a draftee so that he will immediately obey
either the order 'Stand up&quot; or the order &quot;Sit down,&quot; if given by
a superior officer, then have two officers simultaneously order him to stand up
and sit down. Obeying the first order means disobeying the second, and obeying
the second means disobeying the first. Presumably, the subject would wig out.</span></p>
<p>OM projects vary from the trivial to the colossal.</p>
<p>An example of the former is a rubber stamp owned by Dr. Mordecai Malignatus,
which says SEE MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. (Dr. Malignatus casually picked this up
from a public-health clinic while nobody was looking.) Any mail which Dr.
Malignatus considers impertinent or insulting— especially if it comes from a
government office—is stamped with this motto and sent back, otherwise
untouched. This causes considerable puzzlement to various bureaucrats.</p>
<p>An example of the latter is Project Jake, instigated by Harold Lord
Randomfactor. Once or twice a year, a public servant who has distinguished
himself by more than common imbecility is selected as target for a Jake and all
Discordian cabals are alerted—including the various branches of the Erisian
Liberation Front, the Twelve Famous Buddha Minds, the St. Gulik Iconistary, the
Earl of Nines, the Tactile Temple of Eris Erotic, the Brotherhood of the Lust of
Christ, Green &amp; Pleasant Enterprises, Society for Moral Understanding and
Training, the In-Sect, the Golden Apple Panthers, the Paratheo-Anametamystikhood
of Eris Esoteric, Sam's Cafe, the Seattle Group, the Stone Dragon Cabal, the
Universal Erisian Church, and the Young Americans for Real Freedom.* On Jake
Day, the public servant being honored receives mail from <i>all </i>of these, on
their official letterheads (which are somewhat weird, it must be granted),
asking for help in some complicated political matter that passes all rational
understanding. The official so honored can conclude either that he is the target
of a conspiracy composed entirely of lunatics, or that the general public is
much more imaginative and less stodgy than he had previously assumed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* All these are real groups, currently active
in the U.S A. (Do you believe that?)</span></p>
<p>Between the trivial and the colossal there is a variety of OM which can be
called the chronic.</p>
<p>Most notable is the honorary membership. Not wishing to exclude anybody from
membership in the Erisian movement for such a technicality as being non-Erisian,
the legendary Malaclypse the Younger invented several honorary Aneristic groups.
It is now the tradition for any Discordian cabal to appoint anybody to one of
these groups if his or her behavior is notably Aneristic. For instance, a
high-school principal who has given a particularly stirring assembly speech on
some such topic as &quot;The Draft as a Protection for Our Freedoms&quot; (or
&quot;Taxation as a Protection for Our Property&quot; or any of the other
oxymorons beloved by educators) might thereafter receive some such mailing as
this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">ORDER OF THE PEACOCK ANGEL</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">House of Apostles of Eris</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">(V) Safeguard this letter; it is an important
historical document.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">( ) Burn after reading—subversive
literature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">( ) Ignore and continue what you were doing
before opening this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Dear (V) Sir ( ) Madam ( ) Fido( ):</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">It has recently come to Our ears that you, in
your official capacity as principal of Aaron Burr High School, said in a public
meeting, with your bare face hanging out, that death by napalm is &quot;really
no more painful than a bad cold&quot; and that Orientals have &quot;tougher
epidermi than whites and feel less acutely.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">In Our official capacity as High Priest of the
Head temple of the House of Apostles of Eris, We congratulate you for helping to
restore American education to its rightful position as the envy and despair of
all other (and, hence, lesser) educational systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">You are hereby appointed a five-star General
in the Bureau of the Division of the Department of the Order of the Knights of
the Five-Sided Castle, Quixote Cabal, with full authority to shrapnel your
friends and bomb your neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">If you have any answers, We will be glad to
provide full and detailed questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">In the Name of La Mancha,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Theophobia the Elder, M.C.P. High Priest, Head
temple</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Hail Eris—All hail Discordia—Kallisti</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">This document will be stamped with
such legends as OFFICIAL—DO NOT USE THIS PAPER AS TOILET TISSUE;
SE-CREDIT—FOR YOUR EVES ONLY; QUDCQTE LIVES, etc., all in the </span>most
tasteful blues and reds, together with Easter Bunny seals, ribbons, and whatever
other decorations it pleases the local cabal to attach. Often it will be
accompanied by a button or an armband, making the possessor a five-star General,
adorned with a classic rendition of the Knight of the Mournful Countenance.
Copies, of course, will be sent to the radical students at the school to
guarantee that the principal being honored will see and hear many references to
Don Quixote in following days, lest he think he is dealing with a single
&quot;harmless lunatic.&quot; (The official signal of the Knights of the
Five-Sided Castle, needless to say, is a pentagon with a golden apple inside.)</p>
<p>Other groups to which individuals may be given honorary membership for
conspicuously Aneristic behavior are:</p>
<p>the Hemlock Fellowship—for academic leaders who have taken strong actions
to protect students from disturbing ideas and/or to deny tenure to controversial
teachers or professors; the St. Famine Society for War Against Evil—for people
who have exhibited unusual concern for the moral behavior of their neighbors;
the Flat Earth Society—for legislators or citizens' groups</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* Annual meetings are held on the Feast of St.
Famine at the Casa de Inquisitador in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>dedicated to preventing the dissemination of &quot;modernistic&quot; ideas in
education ; the Fat Jap Anti-Defamation League—for Women's Liberationists and
others who have found good ideological reasons to object to the English
language; the Fraternal Order of Hate Groups—given to allegedly libertarian
groups only if they have engaged in conspicuously authoritarian behavior <i>and </i>have
developed a philosophical line proving that said behavior is actually
libertarian. (That group which has found the best libertarian justification for
opposing liberty receives the Annual William Buckley Memorial Award and joint
membership in the St. Famine Society for War Against Evil.); the First
Evangelical and Reformed Rand, Branden, and Holy Gait Church—for those who are
simultaneously rationalists and dogmatists; the Part-of-the-Solution Vanguard
Party—for any Supreme Servant of the People who has shown inordinate zeal in
banishing most of the people as Parts-of-the-Problem.</p>
<p>Other aspects of Operation Mindfuck include:</p>
<p><i>Project Eagle. </i>Day-glo posters have been printed which look like the
old Eagle proclamation saying TO THE POLLS YE SONS OF FREEDOM. The new, improved
Discordian posters, however, have one slight word change, and say cheerfully
BURN THE POLLS YE SONS OF FREEDOM. Like the Old ones, they are posted in
prominent places on election day. <i>Project Pan-Pontification. </i>Since the
Rev. Kirby Hensley founded the Universal Life Church and started ordaining <i>everybody
</i>as a minister of the gospel, the Paratheo-Aname-tamystikhood of Eris
Esoteric has decided to raise the stakes. They are now distributing cards
stating:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>THE BEARER OF THIS CARD IS A GENUINE AND AUTHORIZED POPE</b></p>
<p>So <i>Please </i>Treat Him Right</p>
<p><b>GOOD FOREVER</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Genuine and authorized by the HOUSE OF
APOSTLES OF ERIS. Every man, woman and child on Earth is a genuine and
authorized Pope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Members receive a
handsome banner proclaiming</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt"> <b>IN YOUR HEART </b></span><b><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.5pt">YOU KNOW IT'S FLAT.</span></b></p>
<p>Similar cards, with &quot;Him&quot; replaced by &quot;Her&quot; and
&quot;Pope&quot; by &quot;Mome,&quot; are being prepared for Woman's
Liberationists.</p>
<p><i>Project Graffito </i>(and <i>Project Bumpersticker). </i>Anybody can
participate by inventing a particularly Erisian slogan and seeing that it is
given wide distribution. Examples: <i>Your Local Police Are Armed and Dangerous;
Legalize Free-Enterprise Murder: Why Should Governments Have All The Fun?; Smash
the Government Postal Monopoly; If Voting Could Change the System, It Would Be
Against the Law; </i>etc.</p>
<p><i>Citizens Against Drug Abuse. </i>This organization possesses elegant
letterheads and is engaged in a campaign of encouraging Congressmen to outlaw
catnip, a drug which some young people are smoking whenever marijuana is in
short supply. The thought behind this project is that, the government having
lost so much credibility due to its war against pot (a recent ELF survey showed
that in some big cities a large portion of the under-25 population did not
believe in any of the moon shots and assumed they were all faked somewhere in
the American Desert), a campaign against this similar but more comical herb will
destroy the last tattered shreds of faith in the men in Washington.</p>
