<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">23 SKIDOO</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linguists and etymologists have had much exercise for their
not-inconsiderable imaginations in attempting to account for this expression. <i>Skidoo
</i>has been traced back to the older <i>skedaddle, </i>and thence to the Greek <i>skedannumi,
</i>&quot;to disperse hurriedly.&quot; The 23, naturally, has caused even more
creative efforts by these gentry, since they are unaware of the secret teachings
of Magick. One theorist, noting that Sidney Carton in Dickens' <i>Tale of Two
Cities </i>is the twenty-third man guillotined in the final scene,* guessed that
those playgoers who were eager to get out of the theater before the crowd
counted off the executions and <i>skidoo'd </i>toward the exits numbered 23.
Another eminent scholar assumes that the expression has something to do with men
hanging around the old Flatiron Building on Twenty-third Street in New York
City—a notoriously windy corner—to watch ladies' skirts raised by the
breeze; when a cop came, they would <i>skidoo. </i>Others have mused
inconclusively about the early telegraph operator's signal of <i>23, </i>which
means (roughly) &quot;stop transmitting,&quot; &quot;clear the line,&quot; or,
to be crude, &quot;shut up,&quot; but nobody claims to know how telegraphers
picked 23 to have this meaning.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* A literary reference which Simon Moon, with
his modernistic bias, overlooked.</span></p>
<p>The mystery's real origin is a closely guarded secret of the Justified
Ancients of Mummu, which Simon had not attained the rank to learn. Dillinger,
however, had attained this rank, and uses the formula quite correctly in the
bank robbery scene in the Third Trip. It was printed by &quot;Prater
Perdurabo&quot; (Aleister Crowley) in <i>The Book of Lies </i>(privately
published, 1915; republished by Samuel Weiser Inc., New York, 1970). The text of
the spell makes up the totality of Chapter 23 in that curious little book; and
it reads:</p>

<p>SKIDOO</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What man is at ease in his Inn?</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Wide is the world and cold.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Thou hast become an in-itiate.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>But thou canst not get out by the way thou earnest</p>
<p>in. The Way out is THE WAY. Get out.</p>
<p>For OUT is Love and Wisdom and Power. Get OUT.</p>
<p>If thou hast T already, first get UT. Then get O. And so at last get OUT.</p>
<p>It is not permissible to explain this fully, but it may be stated guardedly
that T is the union of sex and death, <i>Tau, </i>the Rosy Crucifixion; UT is
Ugita in the Upanishads; and O is the Positive Void.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* Fission Chips, like our other characters,
was given a chance to peruse this manuscript before publication and correct any
factual errors that may have crept in. Of this appendix, he said, &quot;I think
my leg is being pulled again, chaps. I suspect that Crowley wrote that in 1915
as a joke on his readers, and you blokes found it and inserted a reference to a
magic formula used by Dillinger in your story just so you could then compose
this appendix and 'explain' it.&quot; Such skepticism.</span></p>
