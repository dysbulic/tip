<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among those who knew that the true faith of Mohammed was contained in the
Ishmaelian teachings, most were sent out into the world to seek positions in the
governments of, the Near East and Europe. Since it pleased Allah to decree this
task for them, they obeyed willingly; many served thus for their whole lives.
Some, however, after five or ten or even twenty years of such fealty to a given
shah or caliph or king, would receive, through surreptitious channels, a
parchment bearing the symbol: <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1027"

<img src="1.htm6.jpg" alt="illum-part2-6.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027" width="23" height="22">That
night, the servant would strike, and disappear like smoke; and the master would
be found in the morning, throat cut, with the emblematic Flame Dagger of the
Ishmaelians lying beside him. Others were chosen to serve in a different manner,
maintaining the palace of Hassan i Sabbah himself at Alamout. These were
especially fortunate, for it was their privilege to visit more often than others
the Garden of Delights, in which the Lord Hassan himself would, through his
command of magic chemicals, transfer them into heaven while they still lived in
the body. One day in the year 470 (known to the uncircumcized Christian dogs as
1092 A.D.) another proof of the Lord Has-san's powers was given to them, for
they were all summoned to the throne room and there sat the Lord Hassan in all
his glory, while before him on the floor lay a plate bearing the head of the
disciple Ibn Azif.</p>
<p>&quot;This deluded one,&quot; the Lord Hassan declared, &quot;has disobeyed a
command—the one crime that cannot be forgiven in our Sacred Order. I show you
his head to remind</p>
<p>you of the fate of traitors in this world. More; I will instruct you on the
fate of such dogs in the next world.&quot; So saying, the good and wise Lord
Hassan rose from his throne, walking with his characteristic lurching gait, and
approached the head. &quot;I command thee,&quot; he said. &quot;Speak.&quot;</p>
<p>The mouth opened and the head emitted a scream such that all the faithful
covered their ears and turned their eyes away, many of them muttering prayers.</p>
<p>&quot;Speak, dog!&quot; the wise Lord Hassan repeated. &quot;Your whine is of
no interest to us. Speak!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The flames,&quot; the head cried. &quot;The terrible flames. Allah, the
flames . . .&quot; it babbled on as a soul will in extreme agony.
&quot;Forgiveness,&quot; it begged. &quot;Forgiveness, O mighty Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no forgiveness for traitors,&quot; said the all-wise Hassan.
&quot;Return to hell!&quot; And the head immediately silenced. All bowed down
and prayed to Hassan and Allah alike; of the many miracles they had seen this
was certainly the greatest and most terrible.</p>
<p>The Lord Hassan then dismissed everyone, saying, &quot;Forget not this
lesson. Let it stay in your hearts longer than the names of your fathers.&quot;</p>
<p><i>(&quot;We want to recruit you,&quot; Hagbard said, 900-odd years later,
&quot;because you are so gullible. That is, gullible in the right way.&quot;)</i></p>
<p>Jesus Christ went by on a bicycle. That was my first warning that I shouldn't
have taken acid before coming down to Balbo and Michigan to see the action. But
it really seemed right, on another level: acid was the only way to relate to
that whole Kafka-on-a-bummer example of quote democratic process in action
unquote. I found Hagbard in Grant Park, cool as usual, with a bucket of water
and a pile of handkerchiefs for the teargas victims. He was near the General
Logan statue, watching the more violent confrontations across the street at the
Hilton, sucking one of his Italian cigars and looking like Ahab finally finding
the whale . . . <i>Hagbard, in fact, was remembering Professor Tochus at
Harvard: </i>&quot;Damn it, Celine, you <i>can't </i>major in naval engineering
and law both. You're not Leonardo da Vinci, after all.&quot; &quot;But I
am,&quot; he had replied, poker-faced. &quot;I recall all my past incarnations
in detail and Leonardo was one of them.&quot; Tochus almost exploded: <i>&quot;Be
</i>a wise-ass, then! When you start flunking half your subjects, perhaps you'll
come back to reality.&quot; The old man had been terribly disappointed to see
the long row of <i>As. </i>Across the street, the demonstrators advanced toward
the Hilton and the police charged again, clubbing them back; Hagbard wondered if
Tochus had ever realized that a professor is a policeman of the intellect. Then
he saw the Padre's new disciple, Moon, approaching. . . . <i>&quot;You haven't
been clubbed yet,&quot; </i>I said, thinking that in a sense Jarry's old
presurrealist classic, &quot;The Crucifixion of Christ Considered as an Uphill
Bike Race,&quot; was really the best metaphor for the circus Daley was running.
&quot;Neither have you, I'm glad to see,&quot; Hagbard replied: &quot;Judging
from your eyes, though; you got teargassed in Lincoln Park last night.&quot; I
nodded, remembering that I had been thinking of him and his weird Discordian
yoga when it happened. Malik, the dumb social-democratic-liberal that John
wanted to recruit soon, was only a few feet away, and Burroughs and Ginsberg
were near me on the other side. I could see, suddenly, that we were all
chessmen, but who was the chessmaster moving us? And how big was the board?
Across the street, a rhinoceros moved ponderously, turning into a jeep with a
barbed-wire crowd-sticker on the front of it. &quot;My head's leaking,&quot; I
said.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you have any idea who's picking it up?&quot; Hagbard asked. He was
remembering a house lease in Professor Orlock's class. &quot;What it amounts to,
in English,&quot; Hagbard had said, &quot;is that the tenant has no rights that
can be successfully defended in court, and the landlord has no duties on which
he cannot, quite safely, default.&quot; Orlock looked pained, and several
students were shocked, as if Hagbard had suddenly jumped up and exposed his
penis in front of the class. &quot;That's putting it too baldly,&quot; Orlock
said finally. . . . &quot;<i>It</i> <i>might be somebody years in the
future,&quot; </i>I said, <i>&quot;or the past.&quot; </i>I wondered if Jarry
was picking it up, in Paris, half a century before; that would account for the
resemblance. Abbie Hoffman went by just then, talking to Apollonius of Tyana.
Were we all in Jarry's mind, or Joyce's? We even have a Sheriff Wood riding herd
on us and Rubin's horde of Jerry men. . . . <i>&quot;Fuller's car is a stunt, a
showpiece,&quot; </i>Professor Caligari fumed, &quot;and, anyway, it has nothing
to do with naval architecture.&quot; Hagbard looked at him levelly and said,
&quot;It has <i>everything </i>to do with naval architecture.&quot; As in law
school, the other students were disturbed. Hagbard began to understand: they are
not here to learn, they are here to acquire a piece of paper that would make
them eligible for certain jobs....</p>

<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #15</p>
<p>8/6</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p>Here's the weirdest version of the Uluminati history that I've found so far.
It's from a publication written, edited and published by somebody named Philip
Campbell Argyle-Stuart, who holds that the conflicts in the world are due to an
age-old war between Semitic &quot;Khazar&quot; peoples and Nordic
&quot;Faustian&quot; peoples. This is the essence of his thinking:</p>
<p>My theory is that an extremely devilish imposed overcrust was added to the
Khazar population consisting of humanoids who arrived by flying saucer from the
planet Vulcan, which I assume to be not in intra-Mercurial orbit around the sun,
but rather in the earth's orbit, behind the Sun, forever out of sight to
earthlings, always six months behind or ahead of the earth in orbital travel....</p>
<p>Likewise for the Gothic Faustian Western Culture. The previously
comparatively inert and purposeless migrating population streams known as
Franks, Goths, Angles, Saxons, Danes, Swabians, Alemani, Lombards, Vandals, and
Vikings suddenly had an overcrust added consisting of Norman-Martian-Varangians,
arriving from Saturn by way of Mars in flying saucers. . . .</p>
<p>After 1776 it (the Khazar-Vulcanian conspiracy) used the Illuminati and Grand
Orient Masons. After 1815 it used the financial machinations of the House of
Rothschild and after 1848 the Communist movement and after 1895 the Zionist
movement. . . .</p>
<p>One more thing needs to be mentioned. Mrs. Helena Petrovna Blavatski (nee
Hahn in Germany),</p>
<p>1831-1891, founder of Theosophy . .. was both hypocritical and devilish, a
true witch of great evil power allied with Illuminati, Grand Orient Masons,
Russian Anarchists, British Israel Theorists, Proto-Zionists, Arabian Assassins
and Thuggi from India.</p>

<p>&quot;What was that word?&quot; Private Celine asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;SNAFU,&quot; Private Pearson told him. &quot;You mean to say you never
heard it before?&quot; He sat up in his bunk and stared.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a naturalized citizen,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;I was born in
Norway.&quot; He pulled his shirt away from his back again; the Fort Benning
summer was much too hot for the Nordic half of his genes. &quot;Situation
Normal, All Fucked Up,&quot; he repeated. &quot;That really sums it up. That
really says it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait'll you've been in This Man's Army a little longer,&quot; the black
man told him vehemently. &quot;Then you'll really <i>appreciate </i>the <i>application
</i>of that word, dads. Oh, man, will you <i>appreciate </i>it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not just the army,&quot; Hagbard said thoughtfully. &quot;It's the
whole world.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Actually, after they immanentized the Eschaton, I found out where my head
was leaking that night (and a few other nights, too.) </i>Into poor George Dorn.
The leak almost gave him water on the brain. He kept wondering where all that
Joyce and surrealism was coming from. I'm seven years older than he is, tmt
we're on the same valence because of similar grammar school experiences and
revolutionary fathers. That's why Hagbard never really understood either of us,
fully: he had private tutors until he hit college, and by that stage Official
Education is beginning to make some partial concessions to reality so the
victims have at least a chance of surviving on the outside. But I didn't know
any of that in Grant Park that night or how the Army helped Hagbard understand
college, because I was working out this new notion of the total valence of the
set remaining constant. It would mean that I would have to leave when George
came on, or say, Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield had to do the pill or
auto-wreck shticks before there was room for Racquel Welch's vibes.</p>

<p>8/7</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p>I think I've found the clue as to how Zoroaster, flying saucers and all that
lunatic-fringe stuff fits into the Illuminati puzzle. Dig this, boss-man:</p>
<p>The Nazi Party was founded as the political appendage of the Thule Society,
an extremist fringe of the Illuminated Lodge of Berlin. This lodge, in turn, was
made up of Rosicrucians—high Freemasons—and its preoccupation was mourning
the death of the feudal system. Masons of this time were, like the Federalist
Party in post-revolutionary America, working diligently to prevent
&quot;anarchy&quot; and preserve the old values by bringing about Christian
Socialism. Indeed, the Aaron Burr conspiracy, which Professor Hof-stadter notes
was allegedly Masonic in origin, was an American prototype of German intrigues
of a century later. To their external scientific socialism these Masons added
mystic concepts which were thought to be &quot;gnostic&quot; in origin. One of
these was the concept of &quot;Gnosticism&quot; itself, called
Illumination—which held that heavenly beings directly or indirectly gave
humanity its great ideas and would come back to Earth after mankind had achieved
sufficient progress. Illumination was a brand of pentecostalism which was
persecuted by orthodox Christianity for centuries and had become lodged in
Freemasonry through a complex historical process which is impossible to explain
without a major digression. It is sufficient to say that the Nazis, being
&quot;Illuminated,&quot; felt themselves to be divinely inspired and therefore
felt justified in rewriting the rules of good and evil to suit their own
purposes.</p>
<p>(According to Nazi theory) the heavenly beings, before the present Moon was
captured, had lived on the highest ground, in Peru, Mexico, Condor (Ethiopia),
Himalaya, Atlantis and Mu, forming the Uranian Confederation. This was taken
quite seriously and British intelligence actually combatted it with the Tolkien
fantasy called the &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; basis for the famous
&quot;Hobbit&quot; books. . . .</p>
<p>Both J. Edgar Hoover and Congressman Otto Passman are high-ranking Masons and
both, significantly, reflect this philosophy and its Manichean attitude. The
chief danger in Masonic thinking aside from the &quot;divine right of
government&quot; is, of course, Manicheanism, the belief that your opponent is
opposing God's will and is therefore an agent of Satan. This is the extreme
application and Mr. Hoover usually reserves it for &quot;Godless Communism&quot;
but it is almost always present to some degree.</p>

America&quot; by J. F. C. Moore, <i>Libertarian American, </i>Vol. III, No. 3,

<p>They were using Mace now, and I saw one photographer snapping a picture of a
cop while the cop was still Macing him (Heisenberg rides again! From out of the
west come the thundering hooves of the great hearse, Joint Phenomenon! Except
that I was on acid; if I'd been on weed, then it would really, royally, be a
Joint Phenomenon). And I heard later that the photographer got an award for that
shot. Right then, he didn't look like he was getting an award. He looked like
they had just taken off his skin and touched each raw nerve with a dentist's
drill. &quot;Christ,&quot; I said to Hagbard, &quot;look at that poor bastard. I
hope I come out of this with just another teargassing or two. I don't want any
of that Mace.&quot; But acid is placid, you know, and a minute later I was on
Joyce's juices again and thinking of a drama called 'Their Mace and My
Gripes.&quot; I made the first line fruity, in honor of Padre Pederastia:
&quot;What a botch of a pair to plumb this hour's gripes.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Bism'allah,&quot; </i>Hagbard said. &quot;Our karma is made by our
deeds, not by our prayers. You're on the set, so you take the action as it
comes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, cut out that Holy Man craperoo and stop reading</p>
<p>my mind,&quot; I protested. &quot;You don't have to go on impressing
me.&quot; But I was off on another tangent, which went something like this: If
this set is Mayor Daley's circus, then Mayor Daley is the ringmaster. If the
things below are the things above, as Hermes hermetically hinted, then this set
is the bigger set. Mr. Microcosm, meet Mr. Macrocosm. &quot;Hi, Mike!&quot;
&quot;Hi, Mac.&quot; Conclusion: Mayor Daley, in a small way, is what Krishna
is, in a large way. QED.</p>
<p>Just then some SDS kids who'd been teargassed across the street came running
our way, and Hagbard got busy handing out wet handkerchiefs. They needed them:
they were half-blind, like Joyce splitting his Adam into wise hopes. And I
wasn't much help, because I was tod busy crying myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard,&quot; I gasped in ecstasy. &quot;Mayor Daley is Krishna.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Worse luck for him,&quot; he said curtly, distributing the
handkerchiefs. &quot;He doesn't suspect it.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought, suddenly:</p>
<p>Hubert the Hump has coughed and hawked And spat on the streets that Lincoln
walked</p>
<p>The water turned to blood (Hagbard was a joking jolting Jesus: you expected
wine maybe?) and I remembered my mother's story about Dillinger at the Biograph.
We all sit there, like him, in the Biograph Theatre, dreaming the drama of our
lives, then walk outside to the grandmotherly kindness of the lead kisses that
wake us back to our slipping beatitude. Except that he found a way to come back.
What was it Charley Mordecai said: &quot;First as tragedy, then as farce?&quot;
Marxism-Lennonism: Ed Sanders of the Fugs, the night before, talking about
fucking in the streets as if he had read my mind (or had I read his?) and
Lennon's &quot;Why Don't We Do It in the Road&quot; was recorded a year in the
future. The Marx and our groupies. The bloody handkerchiefs dipped into water,
or wine, and the mass rite went on, the mass went Right On, the Mace they rowed.
Capone set it up for the Feds, but John was fed up and left the set, so an extra
named Frank Sullivan got the bullets. The Autobiograph Theatre, a drama house
and a trauma, yes. I maybe should have taken only half a</p>
<p>tab instead of the full 500 mikes, because at that point the SDS kids, all of
them siding with RYM-I at the split next year, looked like they had altarboy
robes on and I thought Hagbard was distributing communion wafers, not
handkerchiefs. He looked at me, suddenly, with that hawk-faced Egyptian glare,
and I observed that he had observed, Hopalong Horus Heisenberg, just where I was
at You don't have to be a waterman, I thought, to know which way my mind is
blowing.</p>
<p>There was a sound from the crowd, like a subway opening all its doors with a
suck of air, and I saw the police coming, crossing the street to clear the park.</p>
<p>&quot;Here we go again,&quot; I said. &quot;All hail Discordia,&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Snafu ueber alles,&quot; </i>Hagbard grinned, starting to trot
beside me.</p>
<p>We headed North, figuring that the ones who retreated eastward would get
trapped against the wall and creamed. &quot;Democracy in action,&quot; I said,
panting along.</p>
<p>'There thou might'st behold the very image of Authority,&quot; he quoted,
shifting his water bucket to keep it in balance. I caught the Shakespearean
reference and looked back: my mind had already: each policeman indeed looked
like Shakespeare's dog. I remembered the frantic semantics at the LBJ
anti-birthday party, when Burroughs insisted Chicago Cops were more like dogs
than pigs, in contradiction to the SDS rhetoric. Terry Southern, taking his
usual maniacal middle course, claimed they were more akin to the purple-assed
mandrill, most surly of the baboon family. But most of them hadn't discovered
writing yet.</p>
<p>&quot;Authority?&quot; I asked, realizing I'd lost something along the way.
We were slowing to a walk, the action was behind us.</p>
<p>&quot;A is not A,&quot; Hagbard explained with that tiresome patience of his.
&quot;Once you accept A <i>is A, </i>you're hooked. Literally hooked, addicted
to the System.&quot;</p>
<p>I caught the references to Aristotle, the old man of the tribe with his
unfortunate epistemological paresis, and also to that feisty little lady I
always imagine is really the lost Anastasia, but I still didn't grok. &quot;What
do you mean?&quot; I asked, grabbing a wet handkerchief as some of the teargas
started to drift to our end of the park.</p>
<p>&quot;Chairman Mao didn't say half of it,&quot; Hagbard replied</p>
<p>holding a handkerchief to his own face. His words came through muffled:
&quot;It isn't only political power that grows out of the barrel of a gun. So
does a whole definition of reality. A set. And the action that has to happen on
that particular set and on none other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be so bloody patronizing,&quot; I objected, looking around a
corner in time and realizing this was the night I would be Maced. &quot;That's
just Marx: the ideology of the ruling class becomes the ideology of the whole
society.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not the ideology. The Reality.&quot; He lowered his handkerchief.
&quot;This was a public park until they changed the definition. Now, the guns
have changed the Reality. It <i>isn't </i>a public park. There's more than one
kind of magic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just like the Enclosure Acts,&quot; I said hollowly. &quot;One day the
land belonged to the people. The next day it belonged to the landlords.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And like the Narcotics Acts,&quot; he added. &quot;A hundred thousand
harmless junkies became criminals overnight, by Act of Congress, in nineteen
twenty-seven. Ten years later, in thirty-seven, all the pot-heads in the country
became criminals overnight, by Act of Congress. And they really were criminals,
when the papers were signed. The guns prove it. Walk away from those guns,
waving a joint, and refuse to halt when they tell you. Their Imagination will
become your Reality in a second.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And I had my answer to Dad, finally, just as a cop jumped
out of the darkness screaming something about freaking motherfucking fag commies
and Maced me, as was certain to happen (I knew it as I crumbled in pain) on that
set.</p>

<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #16</p>
<p>8/7</p>
<p>J.M.:</p>
<p>Here's some more info on how Blavatsky, theosophy and the motto under the
great pyramid on the U.S. Seal fit into the Illuminati picture (or <i>don't </i>fit
into the picture. It's getting more confusing the further I dig into it!) This
is an article defending Madame Blavatsky, after Truman Capote had repeated the
John Birch Society's charge that Sirhan Sirhan was inspired to murder Robert
Kennedy by reading Blavatsky's works: &quot;Sirhan Blavatsky Capote&quot; by Ted
Zatlyn, <i>Los Angeles Free Press, </i>July 26, 1968:</p>
<p>Birchers that attack Madame Blavatsky, though smaller in number and as crazy
as ever, find a new home in an atmosphere of suspicion and violence. Truman
Capote takes them seriously. . . .</p>
<p>Does Mr. Capote know that the Illuminati (according to sacred Birch doctrine)
began in the Garden of Eden when Eve made it with the snake and gave birth to
Cain? That all the descendants of snake-man Cain belong to a super-secret group
known as the Illuminati, dedicated to absolutely nothing but the meanest low
down evil imagined in the Satanic mind of man?</p>
<p>Anti-Illuminati John Steinbacher writes in his unpublished book, <i>Novus
Ordo Seclorum </i>(The New Order of the Ages): &quot;Today in America, many
otherwise talented people are flirting with disaster by associating with those
same evil forces . . . Madame Blavatsky's doctrine was strikingly similar to
that of Weishaupt. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>The author also gives <i>his </i>version of the <i>Bircher's </i>version of
what the Illuminati are actually trying to accomplish:</p>
<p>Their evil goal is to transcend materiality, and to bring about one world,
denying the sovereignty of nations and the sanctity of private proverty.</p>
<p>I don't think I can believe, or even understand, this, but at least it
explains how both the Nazis and the Communists can be pawns of the Illuminati.
Or does it?</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>&quot;Property is theft,&quot; Hagbard said, passing the peace pipe.</p>
<p>&quot;If the BIA helps those real estate developers take our land,&quot;
Uncle John Feather said, &quot;that will be theft. But if we keep the land, that
is certainly not theft.&quot;</p>
<p>Night was falling in the Mohawk reservation, but Hagbard saw Sam Three Arrows
nod vigorously in the gloom of the small cabin. He felt, again, that American
Indians were the hardest people in the world to understand. His tutors had given
him a cosmopolitan education, in every sense of the word, and he usually found
no blocks in relating to people of any culture, but the Indians</p>
<p>did puzzle him at times. After five years of specializing in handling the
legal battles of various tribes against the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the
land pirates it served, he was still conscious that these people's heads were
someplace he couldn't yet reach. Either they were the simplest, or the most
sophisticated, society on the planet; maybe, he thought, they were both, and the
ultimate simplicity and the ultimate sophistication are identical.</p>
<p>&quot;Property is liberty,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;I am quoting the same
man who said property is theft. He also said property is impossible. I speak
from the heart. I wish you to understand why I take this case. I wish you to
understand in fullness.&quot;</p>
<p>Sam Three Arrows drew on the pipe, then raised his dark eyes to Hagbard's.
&quot;You mean that justice is not known like a dog who barks in the night? That
it is more like the unexpected sound in the woods that must be identified
cautiously after hard thinking?&quot;</p>
<p>There it was again: Hagbard had heard the same concreteness of imagery in the
speech of the Shoshone at the opposite end of the continent. He wondered, idly,
if Ezra Pound's poetry might have been influenced by habits of speech his father
acquired from the Indians—Homer Pound had been the first white man born in
Idaho. It certainly went beyond the Chinese. And it came, not from books on
rhetoric, but from listening to the heart—the Indian metaphor he had himself
used a minute ago.</p>
<p>He took his time about answering: he was beginning to acquire the Indian
habit of thinking a long while before speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Property and justice are water,&quot; he said finally. &quot;No man can
hold them long. I have spent many years in courtrooms, and I have seen property
and justice change when a man speaks, change as the caterpillar changes to the
butterfly. Do you understand me? I thought I had victory in my hands, and then
the judge spoke and it went away. Like water running through the fingers.&quot;</p>
<p>Uncle John Feather nodded. &quot;<i>I</i> understand. You mean we will lose
again. We are accustomed to losing. Since George Washington promised us these
lands 'as long as the mountain stands and the grass is green,' and then broke
his promise and stole part of them back in ten years—in ten years, my
friend!—we have lost, always lost</p>
<p>We have one acre left of each hundred promised- to us then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We may not lose,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;I promise you, the BIA will
at least know they have been in a fight this time. I learn more tricks, and get
nastier, each time I go into a courtroom. I am very tricky and very nasty by
now. But I am less sure of myself than I was when I took my first case. I no
longer understand what I am fighting. I have a word for it—the Snafu
Principle, I call it—but I do not understand what it is.&quot;</p>
<p>There was another pause. Hagbard heard the lid on the garbage can in back of
the cabin rattling: that was the raccoon that Uncle John Feather called Old
Grandfather come to steal his evening dinner. Property was theft, certainly, in
Old Grandfather's world, Hagbard thought.</p>
<p>&quot;I am also puzzled,&quot; Sam Three Arrows said finally. &quot;I worked,
long ago, in New York City, in construction, like many young men of the Mohawk
Nation. I found that whites were often like us, and I could not hate them one at
a time. But they do not know the earth or love it. They do not speak from the
heart, usually. They do not act from the heart. They are more like the actors on
the movie screen. They play roles. And their leaders are not like our leaders.
They are not chosen for virtue, but for their skill at playing roles. Whites
have told me this, in plain words. They do not trust their leaders, and yet they
follow them. When we do not trust a leader, he is finished. Then, also, the
leaders of the whites have too much power. It is bad for a man to be obeyed too
often. But the worst thing is what I have said about the heart. Their leaders
have lost it and they have lost mercy. They speak from somewhere else. They act
from somewhere else. But from where? Like you, I do not know. It is, I think, a
kind of insanity.&quot; He looked at Hagbard and added politely. &quot;Some are
different.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a long speech for him, and it stirred something in Uncle John Feather.
&quot;I was in the army,&quot; he said. &quot;We went to fight a bad white man,
or so the whites told us. We had meetings that were called orientation and
education. There were films. It was to show us how this bad white man was doing
terrible things in his country. Everybody was angry after the films, and eager
to fight. Except me. I was only there because the army paid more than an Indian
can earn anywhere else. So I was not angry, but puzzled. There was nothing that
this white leader did that the white leaders in this country do not also do.
They told us about a place named Lidice. It was much like Wounded Knee. They
told us of families moved thousands of miles to be destroyed. It was much like
the Trail of Tears. They told us of how this man ruled his nation, so that none
dared disobey him. It was much like the way white men work in corporations in
New York City, as Sam has described it to me. I asked another soldier about
this, a black white man. He was easier to talk to than the regular white man. I
asked him what he thought of the orientation and education. He said it was shit,
and he spoke from the heart! I thought about it a long time, and I knew he was
right. The orientation and education was shit. When the men from the BIA come
here to talk, it is the same. Shit. But let me tell you this: the Mohawk Nation
is losing its soul. Soul is not like breath or blood or bone and it can be taken
in ways no man understands. My grandfather had more soul than I have, and the
young men have less than me. But I have enough soul to talk to Old Grandfather,
who is a raccoon now. He thinks as a raccoon and he is worried about the raccoon
nation, more than I am worried about the Mohawk Nation. He thinks the raccoon
nation will die soon, and all the nations of the free and wild animals. That is
a terrible thing and it frightens me. When the nations of the animals die, the
earth will also die. That is an old teaching and I cannot doubt it. I see it
happening, already. If they steal more of our land to build that dam, more of
our soul will die, and more of the souls of the animals will die! The earth will
die, and the stars will no longer shine! The Great Mother herself may die!&quot;
The old man was crying unashamedly. &quot;And it will be because men do not
speak words but speak shit!&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard had turned pale beneath his olive skin. &quot;You're coming into
court,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;and you're going to tell the judge that, in
exactly those words.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO <i>#17</i></p>
<p>8/8</p>
<p>J.M.: You may remember that the <i>East Village Other's </i>chart of</p>
<p>the Illuminati Conspiracy (Memo <i>#9) </i>listed &quot;The Holy Vehm&quot;
as an Illuminati front. I have finally found out what The Holy Vehm is (or,
rather was). My source is Eliphas Levy's <i>History of Magic, </i>op. cit.,
pages 199-200:</p>
<p>They were a kind of secret police, having the right of life and death. The
mystery which surrounded their judgments, the swiftness of their executions,
helped to impress the imagination of people still in barbarism. The Holy Vehm
assumed gigantic proportions; men shuddered in describing apparitions of masked
persons, of summonses nailed to the doors of nobles in the very midst of their
watch-guards and their orgies, of brigand chiefs found dead with the terrible
cruciform dagger in their breasts and on the scroll attached thereto an extract
from the sentence of the Holy Vehm. The Tribunal affected most fantastic forms
of procedure: the guilty person, cited to appear at some discredited cross-road,
was taken to the assembly by a man clothed in black, who bandaged his eyes and
led him forward in silence. This occurred invariably at some unseemly hour of
the night, for judgment was never pronounced except at midnight. The criminal
was carried into a vast underground vault, where he was questioned by one voice.
The hoodwink was removed, the vault was illuminated in all its depth and height,
and the Free Judges sat masked and wearing black vestures.</p>
<p>The Code of the Vehmic Court was found in the ancient archives of Westphalia
and has been printed in the Reichstheater of Muller, under the following title:
&quot;Code and Statutes of the Holy Secret Tribunal of Free Courts and Free
Judges of Westphalia, established in the. year 772 by the Emperor Charlemagne
and revised in 1404 by King Robert, who made those alterations and additions
requisite for the administration of justice in the tribunals of the illuminated,
after investing them with his own authority.&quot;</p>
<p>A note on the first page forbade any profane person to glance at the book
under penalty of death. The word &quot;illuminated&quot;, here given to the
associates of the Secret Tribunal, unfolds their entire mission: they had to
track down in the shadows those who worshipped the darkness; they counterchecked
mysteriously those who conspired against society in favour of mystery; but they
were themselves the secret soldiers of light, who cast the light of day on
criminal plottings, and it is this which was signified by a sudden splendour
illuminating the Tribunal when it pronounced sentence.</p>
<p>So now we have to add <i>Charlemagne </i>to the list of the
Illuminated—along with Zoroaster, Joachim of Floris, Jefferson, Washington,
Aaron Burr, Hitler, Marx, and Ma-dame Blavatsky. Could this <i>all </i>be a
hoax?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #18</p>
<p>8/9</p>
<p>J.M.:</p>
<p>My last memo may have been too hasty in using the past tense in speaking
about the Holy Vehm. I find that Darual thinks they may still exist <i>(History
of Secret Societies, </i>op. cit., p. 211):</p>
<p>These terrible courts were never formally abolished. They were reformed by
various monarchs, but even in the nineteenth century it was said that they still
existed, though very much underground. The Nazi werewolves and resistance
organizations fighting the Communist occupation of East Germany claimed that
they were carrying on the tradition of the &quot;Chivalrous and Holy Vehm.&quot;
Perhaps they still are.</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>Federal Court for the 17th District of New York State. Plaintiffs: John
Feather, Samuel Arrows, et al. Defendants: Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department
of the Interior, and President of the United States. For plaintiffs: Hagbard
Celine. For the defendants: George Kharis, John Alucard, Thomas Moriarity, James
Moran. Presiding: Justice Quasimodo Immhotep.</p>
<p>MR. FEATHER <i>(concluding): </i>And it will be because men do not speak
words but speak shit! MR. KHARIS: Your honor, I move that the last speech be
stricken from the record as irrelevant and immaterial. We are dealing here with
a practical question, the need of the people of New York for this dam, and Mr.
Feather's superstitions are totally beside the point.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: Your honor, the people of New York have survived a long time
without a dam in that particular place. They can survive longer without it. Can
anything survive, anything worth having, if our words become, as Mr. Feather
says, excrement? Can anything we can reasonably call American Justice survive,
if the words of our first President, if the sacred honor of George Washington is
destroyed, if his promise that the Mohawk could keep these lands &quot;as long
as the mountain stands and the grass is green,&quot; if all that becomes nothing
but excrement?</p>
<p>MR. KHARIS: Counsel is not arguing. Counsel is making speeches.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: I am speaking from the heart. <i>Are you—</i>or are you
speaking excrement that you are ordered to speak by your superiors?</p>
<p>MR. ALUCARD: More speeches.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: More excrement</p>
<p>JUSTICE IMMHOTEP: Control yourself, Mr. Celine.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: I am controlling myself. Otherwise, I would speak as frankly as
my client and say that most of the speeches here are plain old shit. Why do I
say &quot;excrement&quot; at all, if it isn't, tike you people, to disguise a
little what we are all doing? It's shit. Plain shit.</p>
<p>JUSTICE IMMHOTEP: Mr. Celine, you are coming very close to contempt of court.
I warn you.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: Your honor, we speak the tongue of Shakespeare, of Milton, of
Melville. Must we go on murdering it? Must we tear it away from its last
umbilical connection with reality? What is going on in this room, actually?
Defendants, the U.S. government and its agents, want to steal some land from my
clients. How long do we have to argue that they have no justice, no right, no
honor, in their cause? Why can't we say highway robbery is highway robbery,
instead of calling it eminent domain? Why can't we say shit is shit, instead of
calling it excrement? Why do we never use language to convey meaning? Why must
we always use it conceal meaning? Why do we never speak from the heart? Why do
we always speak words programmed into us, like robots?</p>
<p>JUSTICE IMMHOTEP: Mr. Celine, I warn you again.</p>
<p>MR. FEATHER: And I warn you. The world will die. The stars will go out. If
men and women cannot trust the words spoken, the earth will crack, like a rotten
pumpkin.</p>
<p>MR. KHARIS: I call for a recess. Plaintiff and their counsel are both in no
emotional state to continue at this time.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: You even have guns. You have men with guns and clubs, who are
called marshals, and they will beat me if I don't shut up. How do you differ
from any other gang of bandits, then, except in using language that conceals
what you are doing? The only difference is that the bandits are more honest.
That's the only difference. The only difference.</p>
<p>JUSTICE IMMHOTEP : Mr. Marshal, restrain the counsel.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: You're stealing what isn't yours. Why can't you talk turkey for
just one moment? Why—</p>
<p>JUSTICE IMMHOTEP: Just hold him, Marshal. Don't use unnecessary force. Mr.
Celine, I am tempted to forgive you, considering that you are obviously much
involved with your clients, emotionally. However, such mercy on my part would
encourage other lawyers to believe they could follow your example. I have no
choice. I find you guilty of contempt of court. Sentencing will take place when
court reconvenes after a fifteen-minute recess. You may speak at that time, but
only on any mitigating grounds that should lighten the degree of your sentence.
I will not hear the United States government called bandits again. That is all.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: You steal land, and you will not hear yourselves called bandits.
You order men with guns and clubs to hold us down, and you will not hear
yourselves called thugs. You don't act from the heart; where the hell do you act
from? What in God's name does motivate you?</p>
<p>JUSTICE IMMHOTEP: Restrain him, Marshal.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: (Indistinguishable.)</p>
<p>JUSTICE IMMHOTEP: Fifteen-minute recess.</p>
<p>BAILIFF: All rise.</p>
<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #19</p>
<p>8/9</p>
<p>J.M.:</p>
<p>I wish you would explain to me how your interest in the numbers 5 and 23 fit
in with this Illuminati project.</p>
<p>This is all I've been able to unearth so far on the number mystery, and I
hope you find it enlightening. It's from a book of mathematical and logical
paradoxes: <i>How to Torture Your Mind, </i>edited by Ralph L. Woods, Funk and
Wagnalls, New York, 1969, page 128.</p>
<p>2 and 3 are even and odd;</p>
<p>2 and 3 are 5;</p>
<p>Therefore, 5 is both even and odd.</p>
<p>The damned book, by the way, provides no solutions to the paradoxes. I could
sense the fallacy in that one right away, but it took me hours (and a headache)
before I could state it in precise words. Hope this helps you. Anyway, for me,
it was a relief from the really frightening stuff I've been tracking down
lately.</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>There were two further memos in the box, on different stationeries and by
different typewriters. The first was brief:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 4</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">RESEARCH DEPARTMENT:</span></b></p>
<p>I am seriously concerned about Pat's absence from the office, and the fact
that she doesn't answer the phone when we call her. Would you send somebody to
her apartment to talk to the landlord and try to find out what has happened to
her?</p>
<p>Joe Malik Editor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last memo was the oldest in the lot and already yellowing at the edges.
It said:</p>
<p>Dear Mr. &quot;Mallory:&quot;</p>
<p>The information and books, you requested are enclosed, at length. In case you
are rushed, here is a quick summary.</p>
<p>1. Billy Graham was in Australia, making public appearances all through last
week. There is no way he could have gotten to Chicago.</p>
<p>2. Satanism and witchcraft both still exist in the modern world. The two are
often confused by orthodox Christian</p>
<p>writers, but objective observers agree that there is a difference. Satanism
is a Christian heresy—the ultimate heresy, one might say—but witchcraft is
pre-Christian in origin and has nothing to do with the Christian God <i>or </i>the
Christian Devil. The witches worship a goddess called Dana or Tana (who goes
back to the Stone Age probably).</p>
<p>3. The John Dillinger Died For You Society has its headquarters in Mad Dog,
Texas, but was founded in Austin, Texas several years ago. It's some kind of
poker-faced joke and is affiliated with the Bavarian Illuminati, another bizarre
bunch at the Berkeley campus of the University of California. The Illuminati
pretend to be a cabal of conspirators who run the whole world behind the scenes.
If you suspect either of these groups of being involved in something sinister,
you have probably just fallen for one of their put-ons.</p>
<p>W.H.</p>
<p>&quot;So this thing was already linked to Mad Dog several years ago,&quot;
Saul said thoughtfully. &quot;And Malik was already assuming an alternative
identity, since the letter is obviously addressed to him. And, also as I've
begun to suspect as we read this stuff, the Illuminati have their own brand of
humor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Deduce me one more deduction,&quot; Barney said. &quot;Who the hell is
this W.H.?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People have been asking that for three hundred years,&quot; Saul said
absently.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm being whimsical. Shakespeare's sonnets are dedicated to a Mr. W.H.,
but I don't think we have to worry that this is the same one. This case is as
nutty as a-squirrel's dinner, but I don't really think it's <i>that </i>nutty.&quot;
He added, &quot;We can be grateful for one thing at least: the Illuminati
doesn't really run the world. They're just trying.&quot;</p>
<p>Barney frowned, perplexed. &quot;How did you make that one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simple. Same way I know they're a right-wing organization, not
left-wing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're not all geniuses,&quot; Barney said. &quot;Take it a step at a
time, will you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How many contradictions did you spot in these memos? I counted
thirteen. This researcher, Pat, saw it,</p>
<p>too: the evidence is deliberately warped and twisted. All of it—not just
that <i>East Village Other </i>chart—is a mixture of fact and fiction.&quot;
Saul lit his pipe and settled back in his chair (in 1921, reading Arthur Conan
Doyle, he first began playing these scenes, in imagination).</p>
<p>&quot;In the first place, either the Illuminati want publicity or they don't.
If they control everything, and want publicity, they'd be on billboards more
often than Coca-Cola and on TV more often than Lucille Ball. On the other hand,
if they control everything, and <i>don't </i>want publicity, none of these
magazines and books would have survived—they would have disappeared from
libraries, book stores and publisher's warehouses. This researcher, Pat, never
would have found them.</p>
<p>&quot;In the second place, if you want to recruit people into a conspiracy,
besides idealism and whatever other noble motives you might exploit in them, you
would always exploit hope. You would exaggerate the size and power of the
conspiracy, because most people want to join the winning side. Therefore, all
assertions about the actual strength of the Illuminati should be regarded, <i>a
fortiori, </i>as suspect, like the voters' polls released by candidates before
elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, it always pays to frighten the opposition. Therefore a
conspiracy will exhibit the same behavior that ethologists have observed in
animals under attack: it will puff itself up and try to look bigger. In short,
potential or actual recruits and potential and actual enemies will both be given
the same false impression: that the Illuminati is twice, or ten times, or a
hundred times, its actual size. This is logical, but my first point was
empirical—the memos do exist—and therefore logic and empiricism confirm each
other: the Illuminati are not able to control everything. What then? They've
been around a long time and they are as tireless as the Russian mathematician
who worked out <i>pi </i>to the one-thousandth place. The probability, then, is
that they control some things and influence a hell of a lot more. This
probability increases as you think back over the memos. The two chief Arabic
branches— the Hashishim and the Roshinaya—were both wiped out; the Italian
Illuminati were 'crushed' in 1507; Weishaupt's order was suppressed by the
Bavarian government in 1785; and so forth. If they were behind the French
Revolution, they influenced rather than controlled, because Napoleon undid
everything the Jacobins started. That they had a hand in both Soviet Communism
and German Fascism is plausible, considering the many similarities between the
two; but if they controlled both, why did the two take opposite sides in the
Second World War? And, if they ran both the Federalist party, through
Washington, and the Democratic Republicans, through Jefferson, what was the
purpose of the Aaron Burr counterrevolution, which they are also supposed to be
behind? The picture I get is not a grand Puppet Master moving everybody on
invisible strings, but some sort of million-armed octopus—a millepus, let's
call it—constantly reaching out tentacles, and often drawing back nothing but
a bloody stump, crying, 'Foiled again!'</p>
<p>&quot;But the millepus is very busy and quite resourceful. // it controlled
the planet, it could choose either operating in the open or retaining secrecy,
but since it doesn't have that omnipotence yet, it must choose to be as
anonymous as possible. Therefore, many of its tentacles will be probing around
in the areas of publication and communications. It wants to know when somebody
is investigating it or getting ready to publicize an investigation he has
already completed. Finding such a person, it then has two choices: kill him or
neutralize him. Killing may be resorted to in certain emergencies, but will be
avoided when possible: you never know when a person of that sort has stashed
extra copies of his documents in various unexpected places to be released in the
event of his death. Neutralization is best, almost always.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul paused to relight his pipe, and Muldoon thought, <i>The most unrealistic
aspect of Doyle's stories is Watson's admiration at these moments. I'm just
irritated, because he makes me feel like a chump for not seeing it myself. </i>&quot;Go
ahead,&quot; he said gruffly, saving his own deductions until Saul was finished.</p>
<p>&quot;The best form of neutralization is recruitment, of course. But any
crude and hurried effort at recruitment is known as 'taking your pants
down&quot; in the espionage business because it makes you more vulnerable. The
safest approach is gradual recruitment, disguised as something else. The best
disguise, of course, is the pretense of helping the subject in his
investigation. This also opens the second, and preferable, option, which is
leading him on a wild goose chase. Sending him looking for Illuminati in
organizations which they have never really infiltrated. Feeding him balderdash
like that stuff about the Illuminati coming from the planet Vulcan or being
descended from Eve and the Serpent. Best of all, though, is telling him the
purpose of the conspiracy is something other than it actually is, especially if
the story you sell him is in keeping with his own ideals, since this can then
shade over into recruitment.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, the sources this Pat unearthed mostly seem to come to one of two
conclusions: the Illuminati doesn't exist anymore, or the Illuminati is
virtually identical with Russian Communism. The first I reject because Malik and
Pat have both disappeared and two buildings, one here in New York and one way
down in Mad Dog, have been bombed in a series palpably linked with an
investigation of the Illuminati. You've already accepted that, but the next step
is just as obvious. If the Illuminati tries to distort whatever publicity cannot
be avoided, then we should look at the idea that the Illuminati is
communist-oriented as skeptically as we look at the idea that they don't even
exist.</p>
<p>&quot;So, let's look at the opposite hypothesis. Could the Illuminati be a
far-right or fascist group? Well, if Malik's information was in any way
accurate, they seem to have some kind of special headquarters or central office
in Mad Dog—and that's Ku Klux and God's Lightning territory. Also, whatever
their history before Adam Weishaupt, they seem to have gone through some
reformation and revitali-zation under his leadership. He was a German and an
ex-Catholic, just like Hitler. One of his Illuminated Lodges survived long
enough to recruit Hitler in 1923, according to a memo that might be the most
accurate one in the lot for all we know. Considering the proclivities of the
German character, Weishaupt could likely be an anti-Semite. Most historians I've
read on Nazi Germany agree to at least the possibility that there was a 'secret
doctrine' which only the top Nazis shared among themselves and didn't tell the
rest of the party. That doctrine might be pure Il-luminism. Take up the many
links between Illuminism and Freemasonry, and the known anti-Catholicism of the
Masonic movement—add in the fact that ex-Catholics are frequently bitter
against the church, and both Weishaupt and Hitler were ex-Catholics—and we get
a hypothetical anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic, semi-mystical doctrine that</p>
<p>would sell equally well in Germany and in parts of America. Finally, while
some left-extremists might want to kill the Kennedys and Reverend King, all
three were more likely targets for right-wingers; and the Kennedys would be
especially abhorrent to anti-Catholic rightists.</p>
<p>&quot;A last point,&quot; Saul said. &quot;Consider the left-wing orientation
of <i>Confrontation, </i>The editor, Malik, would probably not give much
credence to most of the sources quoted in the memos, since the majority are from
rightist publications, and most of them allege that the Illuminati is a leftist
plot. His most probable reaction would be to dismiss this as another right-wing
paranoia, <i>unless he had other sources besides his own Research Department. </i>Notice
how cagey he is. He doesn't tell his associate editor, Peter Jackson, anything
about the Illuminati itself—just that he wants a new investigation of the last
decade's assassinations. The bottom memo is so old and yellow it suggests he got
his first clue several years ago, but didn't act. Pat asks him why he's hiding
all this from the reporter, George Dorn. Finally, he disappears. He was getting
information from some place else, and it revealed a plot he could believe in and
really fear. That would probably be a Fascist plot, anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish
and anti-Negro.&quot;</p>
<p>Muldoon grinned. <i>For once I don't have to play Watson, </i>he thought.
&quot;Brilliant,&quot; he said. &quot;You never cease to amaze me, Saul. Would
you glance at this, though, and tell me how it fits in?&quot; He handed over a
piece of paper. &quot;I found it in a book on Malik's bedside table.&quot;</p>
<p>The paper was a brief scrawl in the same handwriting as the occasional
jottings on the bottoms of Pat's memos:</p>
<p>Pres. Garfield, killed by Charles Guiteau, a Roman</p>
<p>Catholic. Pres. McKinley, ditto by Leon Czolgosz, a Roman</p>
<p>Catholic. Pres. Theodore Roosevelt, attempted assassination by</p>
<p>John Shrank, a Roman Catholic. Pres. Franklin Roosevelt, attempted
assassination by</p>
<p>Giuseppe Zangara, a Roman Catholic. Pres. Harry Truman, attempted
assassination by</p>
<p>Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo, two Roman</p>
<p>Catholics. Pres. Woodrow Wilson, somewhat mysterious death</p>
<p>while tended by a Roman Catholic nurse.</p>
<p>Pres. Warren Harding, another mysterious death (one rumor: it was suicide),
also attended by a Catholic nurse.</p>
<p>Pres. John Kennedy, assassination inadequately explained. Head of CIA then
was John McCone, a Roman Catholic, who helped write the inconclusive and
contradictory Warren Report.</p>
<p>(House of Representatives, March 1, 1964—five Congressmen wounded by
Lebron-Miranda-Codero-Rod-riguez assassination squad, all Roman Catholics.)</p>
<p>When Saul looked up, Barney said pleasantly, &quot;I found it in a book, like
I said. The book was <i>Rome's Responsibility for the Assassination of Abraham
Lincoln </i>by General Thomas M. Harris. Harris points out that John Wilkes
Booth, the Suratt family, and all the other conspirators were Catholics, and
argues they are acting under orders from the Jesuits.&quot; Barney paused to
enjoy Saul's expression and went on, &quot;It occurs to me that, using your
principle that most of the memos are full of false leads, we might question the
idea that the Illuminati uses the Masons as a front to gather recruits. They
would probably need some similar organization, though—one that exists all over
the world, has mysterious rites and secrets, inner orders to which a select few
are recruited, and a pyramidal authoritarian structure compelling everybody to
take commands from above whether they understand them or not. One such
organization is the Roman Catholic church.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul picked up his pipe from the floor. He didn't seem to remember having
dropped it. &quot;My turn to say, 'brilliant,' &quot; he murmured finally.
&quot;Are you going to stop going to Mass on Sunday? Do you really believe
it?&quot;</p>
<p>Muldoon laughed. &quot;After twenty years,&quot; he said, &quot;I finally did
it. I got one jump ahead of you. Saul, you were standing face-to-face with the
truth, eyeball-to-eyeball, nose-to-nose, mouth-to-mouth—but you were so close
that your eyes crossed and you saw it backward. No, it's not the Catholic
church. You made a good guess in saying it was anti-Catholic as well as
anti-Jewish and anti-Negro. But it's inside the Catholic church and always has
been. In fact, the church's efforts to root it out have given Holy Mother Rome a
very unfortunate reputation for paranoia</p>
<p>and hysteria. Its agents make a special effort to enter the priesthood, in
order to obtain holy objects for use in their own bizarre rites. They also try
to rise as high in the church as they can, to destroy it from within. Many times
they have recruited and corrupted whole parishes, whole orders of clergy, even
whole provinces. They probably got to Weishaupt when he was still a
Jesuit—they've infiltrated that order several times in history and the
Dominicans even more. If caught in criminal acts, they make sure that their
cover Catholicism, and not their true faith, is publicized, just like this list
of assassins. Their God is called the Light-Bearer and that's probably where the
word 'illumination' comes from. And Malik asked about them a long time ago and
was told by this W.H., quite correctly, that they still exist. I'm talking about
the Satanists, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Saul repeated softly, <i>&quot;of course. </i>That
pentagon that keeps popping up—it's the middle of the pentacle for summoning
the Devil. Fascism is only their political facet. Basically, they're a
theology—or an anti-theology, I guess. But what in hell—literally in
hell—is their ultimate objective, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't ask me,&quot; Barney shrugged. &quot;I can follow my brother when
he talks about the history of Satanism, but not when he tries to explain its
motivations. He uses technical theological terms about 'immanentizing the
Eschaton,' but all I can understand is that it has something to do with bringing
on the end of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul turned ashen. &quot;Barney,&quot; he cried, &quot;my God. <i>Fernando
Poor</i></p>
<p>&quot;But that was settled—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's just it. Their usual technique of the false front. The real
threat is coming from somewhere else, and they mean to do it this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Muldoon shook his head. &quot;But they must be crazy!&quot; &quot;Everybody
is crazy,&quot; Saul said patiently, &quot;if you don't understand his
motives.&quot; He held up his tie. &quot;Imagine you arrive in a flying saucer
from Mars—or from Vulcan, like the Illuminati did according to one of our
allegedly reliable sources. You see me get up this morning and for no clear
reason wrap this cloth around my neck, in spite of the heat. What explanation
can you think of? I'm a fetishist—a nut, in other words. Most human behavior
is that sort, not oriented to survival but some symbol-system that people
believe in. Long hair, short hair, fish on Friday, no pork, rising when the
judge enters the room—all symbols, symbols, symbols. Sure the Illuminati are
crazy, from <i>our </i>point of view. From <i>their </i>point of view, we're
crazy. If we can find out what they believe, what their symbols mean to them,
we'll understand why they want to kill most of the rest of us, or all of the
rest of us. Barney, call your brother. Get him out of bed. I want to find out
more about Satanism.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;The devil!&quot; the President shouted on March 27. &quot;Nuclear war
over an insignificant place like Fernando Poo? You must be mental. The American
people are tired of our army policing the whole world. Let Equatorial Guinea
fish its own nuts out of the troubled waters, or whatever that expression
is.&quot; &quot;Wait,&quot; said the Director of the CIA, &quot;let me show you
these aerial photographs . . .&quot;)</p>
<p>Back at the Watergate, G. Gordon Liddy carefully aims his pistol and shoots
out the streetlight: in memory, he is in an old castle at Millbrook, New York,
eagerly searching for naked women and not finding any. Beside him Professor
Timothy Leary is saying with maddening serenity, &quot;But science is the most
ecstatic kick of all. The intelligence of the galaxy is revealed in every atom,
every gene, every cell.&quot; <i>We'll get him back, </i>Liddy thinks savagely, <i>if
we have to assassinate the whole Swiss government. That man is not going to
remain free. </i>Beside him, Bernard Barker shifts nervously as in right-angular
time a future president metamorphoses the plumbers into the cesspool cleaners:
but now, inside the Watergate, the Illuminati bug is unnoticed by those planting
the CREEP bug, although both were subsequently found by the technicians
installing the BUGGER bug. &quot;It's the same Intelligence, making endlessly
meaningful patterns,&quot; Dr. Leary goes on enthusiastically. (&quot;Here,
kitty-kitty,&quot; Hagbard repeats for the 109th time.)</p>
<p>&quot;The devil?&quot; Father James Augustine Muldoon repeated. &quot;Well,
that's a very complicated story. Do you want me to go all the way back to
Gnosticism?&quot;</p>
<p>Saul, listening on the extension phone, nodded a vigorous affirmative.</p>
<p>&quot;Go as far back as you have to,&quot; Barney said. &quot;This is a
complicated matter we're trying to untangle here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK, I'll try to remember you're not in my theology class at Fordham and
keep this as brief as I can.&quot; The priest's voice faded, then came
back—probably he was shifting the phone as he got out of bed and moved to a
chair, Saul guessed.</p>
<p>&quot;There were many approaches to Gnosticism,&quot; the voice went on in a
moment, &quot;all of them centered on <i>gnosis—</i>direct experience of
God—as distinguished from mere knowledge about God. The search for gnosis, or
illumination as it was sometimes called, took many odd forms, some of them
probably similar to Oriental yogas and some of them using the very same drugs
that modern rebels against the slow path of orthodox religion have rediscovered.
Naturally, with such a variety of paths to gnosis, different pilots would land
at different ports, each insisting he had found the real New Jerusalem. Mystics
are all a bit funny in the head anyway,&quot; the priest added cynically,
&quot;which is why the church locks them all up in mental hospitals and
euphemistically calls these institutions monasteries. But I digress.</p>
<p>&quot;What you're interested in, I guess, is Cainism and Manicheanisra. The
former regarded Cain as a specially holy figure because he was the first
murderer. You have to be a mystic yourself to understand that kind of logic. The
notion was that, by bringing murder into the world, Cain created an opportunity
for people to renounce murder. But, then, other Cainites went further—paradox
always seems to breed more paradox and heresy creates more heresy—and ended up
glorifying murder, along with all the other sins. The credo was that you should
commit every sin possible, just to give yourself a chance to win a really
difficult redemption after repenting. Also, it gave God a chance to be
especially generous when He forgave you. Related ideas popped up in Tantric
Buddhism about the same time, and it's a great historical mystery which group of
lunatics, East or West, was influencing the other. Does any of this help you so
far?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A bit,&quot; Barney said.</p>
<p>&quot;About this gnosis,&quot; Saul asked, &quot;is it the orthodox
theological position that the illuminations or visions were actually coming from
the Devil and not from God?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. That's where Manicheanism enters the picture,&quot; Father Muldoon
said. &quot;The Manicheans made exactly the same charge against the orthodox
church. According to their way of looking at it, the God of orthodox
Christianity and orthodox Judaism, <i>was </i>the Devil. The god they</p>
<p>contacted through their own peculiar rites was the real god. This, of course,
is still the teaching of Satanists today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Saul asked, begining to intuit what the answer would be,
&quot;what has all this to do with atomic energy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With atomic energy? Nothing at all. . .at least, nothing that I can
see. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why is Satan called the light-bringer?&quot; Saul plunged on, convinced
he was on the right track.</p>
<p>&quot;The Manicheans reject the physical universe,&quot; the priest said
slowly. &quot;They say that the true god, their god, would never lower himself
to mess around with matter. The God who created the world-r-our God, Jehovah—
they call <i>panurgia, </i>which has the connotations of a kind of blind, stupid
blundering force rather than a truly intelligent being. The realm which their
god inhabits is pure spirit of pure light. Hence, he is called the
light-bringer, and this universe is always called the realm of darkness. But
they didn't know about atomic energy in those days—did they?&quot; The last
sentence had started as a statement and ended as a question.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what <i>I'm </i>wondering,&quot; Saul said. &quot;Atomic power
releases a lot of light, doesn't it? And it sure would immanentize the Eschaton
if enough atomic power was unleashed at once, wouldn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fernando Poo!&quot; the priest exclaimed. &quot;Is this connected with
Fernando Poo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm beginning to think so,&quot; Saul said. &quot;I'm also beginning to
think we've stayed in one place a long time, using a phone that is almost
certainly tapped. We better get moving. Thanks, Father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're quite welcome, although I'm sure I don't know what you're
getting at,&quot; the priest said. &quot;If you think Satanists control the
United States government a few priests would agree with you, especially the
Berrigan brothers, but I don't see how this can be a police matter. Does the New
York Police Department now maintain a bureau of holy inquisitions?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't mind him,&quot; Barney said softly. &quot;He's very cynical about
dogma, like most clergymen these days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I heard that,&quot; the priest said. &quot;I may be cynical but I
really don't think Satanism is a joking matter. And your friend's theory is very
plausible, in its way. After all, the Satanist's motive in infiltrating the
church, in the old days,</p>
<p>was to disgrace the institution thought to represent God on earth. Now that
the United States government makes the same claim, well. That may be a joke or a
paradox on my part, but it's the way their minds work, too. I am a professional
cynic—a theologian must be, these days, if he isn't going to seem a total fool
to young people with their skeptical minds—but I'm orthodox, or downright
reactionary, about the Inquisitions. I've read all the rationalist historians,
of course, and there was certainly an element of hysteria in the church in those
days, but, still, Satanism is not any less frightening than cancer or plague. It
is totally inimical to human life and, in fact, to all life. The church had good
reasons to be afraid of it. Just as people who are old enough to remember have
good reasons to be panicky at any hint of a revival of Hitlerism.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul thought of the cryptic, evasive phrases in Eliphas Levy: &quot;the
monstrous gnosis of Manes . . . the cultus of material fire. . . .&quot; And,
nearly ten years ago, the hippies gathered at the Pentagon, hanging flowers on
the M.P.'s rifles, chanting &quot;Out, demon, out!&quot; . . . Hiroshima ... the
White Light of the Void. . . .</p>
<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; Saul said. &quot;Is there more to it than just <i>ideas </i>about
killing? Isn't killing a mystical experience to the Satanists?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; the priest replied. &quot;That's the whole
point—they want gnosis, personal experience, not dogma, which is somebody
else's word. Rationalists are always attacking dogma for causing fanaticism, but
the worst fanatics start from gnosis. Modern psychologists are just beginning to
understand some of this. You know how people in explosive group-therapy sessions
talk about sudden bursts of energy occurring in the whole group at once? One can
get the same effect with dancing and drum-beating; that's what is called a
'primitive' religion. Use drugs, nowadays, and you're a hippie. Do it with sex,
and you're a witch, or one of the Knights Templar. Mass participation in an
animal sacrifice has the same effect. Human sacrifice has been used in many
religions, including the Aztec cult everybody has heard about, as well as in
Satanism. Modern psychologists say that the force released is Freud's libidinal
energy. Mystics call it prajna or the Astral Light. Whatever it is, human
sacrifice seems to release more of it than sex or drugs or dancing or
drum-beating or any less violent method and mass human sacrifice unleashes a ton
of it. Now do you understand why I fear Satanism and half apologize for the
Inquisition?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Saul said absently, &quot;and I'm beginning to share your
fear. ...&quot; A song he hated was pounding inside his skull: <i>Wenn das
Judenblut vom Messer spritz. . .</i></p>
<p>He realized that he was holding the phone and seeing scenes forty years ago
in another country. He jerked himself back to attention as Muldoon thanked his
brother again and hung up. Saul raised his eyes and the two detectives exchanged
glances of mutual dread.</p>
<p>After a long pause, Muldoon said, &quot;We can't trust anybody with this. We
can hardly even trust each other.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Saul could answer the phone rang. It was Danny Pricefixer at
headquarters. &quot;Bad news. There was only one girl in research at <i>Confrontation
</i>named Pat. Patricia Walsh to be exact, and—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Saul said wearily, &quot;she's disappeared, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do now? The FBI is still raising hell and
demanding to know where you two are and the Commissioner is having the shits,
the fits, and the blind staggers.&quot;</p>
<p>'Tell them,&quot; Saul said succinctly &quot;that we've disappeared.&quot; He
hung up carefully and began stuffing the memos back into the box.</p>
<p>&quot;What now?&quot; Muldoon asked.</p>
<p>&quot;We go underground. And we stick to this until we crack it or it kills
us.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;How long is this motherfucker?&quot; George asked, gesturing at the
Danube six stories below. He and Stella were in their room at the Donau Hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;You won't believe me,&quot; Stella replied, smiling. &quot;It's exactly
one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six miles in length. One-seven-seven-six,
George.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The same as the date Weishaupt revived the Illuminati?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly.&quot; Stella grinned. &quot;We keep telling you. Synchronicity
is as universal as gravity. When you start looking you find it
everywhere.&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;Here's the money,&quot; Banana-Nose Maldonado said generously, opening
a briefcase full of crisp new bills. (It is now November 23, 1963: they were
meeting on a bench near Cleopatra's needle in Central Park: the younger man,
however, is nervous.) &quot;I want to tell you that . . . my superior ... is
very pleased. This will definitely decrease Bobby's power in the Justice
Department and stop a lot of annoying investigations.&quot;</p>
<p>The younger man, Ben Volpe, gulps. &quot;Look, Mr. Mal-donado, there's
something I've got to tell you. I know how the ... Brotherhood ... is when
somebody fucks up and hides it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't fuck up,&quot; Banana-Nose says, bewildered. &quot;In fact,
you lucked out amazingly. That schmuck Oswald is going to fry for it. He came
along at just the right time. It was a real Fortuna . . . Jesus, Mary and
Joseph!&quot; Banana-Nose sits up straight as the thought hits him. &quot;You
mean . . . you mean . . . Did Oswald really do it? Did he shoot <i>before </i>you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; Volpe is miserable. &quot;Let me explain it as clearly as
I can. I'm there on top of the Dallas County Records Building like we planned,
see? The motorcade turns onto Elm and heads for the underpass. I use my
magnifying sight, swinging the whole gun around to look through it, just to make
one last check that I have all the Feds spotted. When I face the School Book
Depository, I catch this rifle. That was Oswald, I guess. Then I check out the
grassy knoll and, goddam, there's another cat with a rifle. I just went cold. I
couldn't figure it out. While I'm in this state, like a zombie, a dog barks and
just then the guy in the grassy knoll calm and cool as if he was at a shooting
range lays three of them right into the car. That's it,&quot; Volpe ends
miserably. &quot;I can't take the money. The . . . Brotherhood . . . would have
my ass if they ever found out the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Maldonado sat silently, rubbing his famous nose as he did when making a hard
decision. &quot;You're a good boy, Bennie. I give you ten percent of the money,
just for being honest. We need more honest young boys like you in the
Brotherhood.&quot;</p>
<p>Volpe swallowed again, and said, &quot;There's one more thing I oughta tell
you. I went down to the grassy knoll, after the cops run from there to the
School Book Depository. I thought I might find the guy who did the shooting
still hanging around and tell you what he looked like. He was long gone, though.
But here's what so spooky. I ran into another galoot; who was sneaking down from
the triple underpass. Long, skinny guy with buck teeth, kind of reminded me of a
python or some kind of snake. He just looks at me and my umbrella and guesses
what's in it</p>
<p>His mouth falls open. 'Jesus Christ and his black bastard brother Harry,' he
says, 'how the <i>fuck </i>many people does it take to kill a President these
days?'&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;And they're teaching them about perversions as well,&quot; Smiling Jim
was building toward his climax. &quot;Homosexuality and lesbianism are being
taught in our schools and we're paying for it out of our tax money. Now is that
communism or isn't it?&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to the Playboy Club,&quot; the beautiful blonde said, &quot;I'm
your bunny, Virgin.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul took his seat in the dark wondering if he had heard correctly. Virgin
was an odd name for a bunny; perhaps she had actually said Virginia. Yes,
Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you wish your steak, sir?&quot; the bunny was asking. A stake
through the heart, for a vampire.</p>
<p>&quot;Medium well,&quot; Saul said, wondering why his mind was wandering in
such odd directions. (&quot;Odd erections,&quot; somebody said in the nearby
dark—or was it a distorted echo of his own voice?)</p>
<p>&quot;Medium well,&quot; the bunny repeated, seemingly speaking to the wall.
A medium wall, Saul thought.</p>
<p>Immediately the wall opened and Saul was looking into a combination kitchen
and butcher shop. A steer was standing not five feet from him, but before he
could recover from this shock a male figure, stripped to the waist and wearing
the hood of a medieval executioner, caught his attention. With one stroke of a
huge hammer, this figure knocked the steer unconscious and it fell to the floor
with a crash. Immediately the executioner produced an axe and chopped its head
off; blood gushed in a crimson pool from its neck.</p>
<p>The wall closed, and Saul had the terrifying feeling that the whole scene had
been a hallucination—that he was losing his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;All our lunches are educational today,&quot; the bunny said in his ear.
&quot;We believe every customer should understand fully what's on the end of his
fork and how it got there, before he takes a bite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good God,&quot; Saul said, getting to his feet. This wasn't a Playboy
Club, it was some den of lunatics and sadists. He stumbled toward the door.</p>
<p>&quot;No way out,&quot; a man at another table said softly as he passed.</p>
<p>&quot;Saul, Saul,&quot; the maitre d' murmured politely, &quot;why dost thou
persecute me? <i>Hab' rochmunas.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;It's a drug,&quot; Saul said thickly, &quot;you've given me a
drug.&quot; Of course, that was it—something like mescaline or LSD—and they
were guiding his hallucinations by providing proper stimuli. Perhaps they were
even faking some of the hallucinations. But how had he fallen into their hands?
The last thing he remembered, he was in Joe Malik's apartment with Barney
Muldoon. . . . No, there was a voice saying, <i>&quot;Now, </i>Sister
Victoria,&quot; as they came out the door onto Riverside Drive. . . .</p>
<p>&quot;No man should marry a woman more than thirty years younger than
himself,&quot; the maitre d' said mournfully. How did they know about that? Had
they investigated his whole life? How long had they held him?</p>
<p>&quot;I'm getting out of here,&quot; he shouted, pushing the maitre d' aside
and bolting for the door.</p>
<p>Hands grasped for him and missed (they weren't really trying, he realized: he
was being allowed to reach the door). When he plunged through the doorway, he
realized why: he was not on the street but in another room. This was the next
ordeal.</p>
<p>A rectangle of light appeared on the wall; somewhere in the darkness there
was a projector. A card, light an old silent-movie caption, appeared in the
rectangle. It said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">ALL JEW GIRLS LIKE TO BALL WITH BUCK
NIGGERS</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Sons of bitches,&quot; Saul shouted back at them. They were still
working on his feelings about Rebecca. Well, that would get them nowhere: he had
ample reason to trust her devotion to him, especially her sexual devotion.</p>
<p>The card moved out of the rectangle, and a picture appeared in its place. It
was Rebecca's, in her nightgown, kneeling. Before her stood a naked and enormous
black man, six feet six at least, with an equally impressive penis which she
held sensuously in her mouth. Her eyes were closed in bliss, like a baby
nursing.</p>
<p>&quot;Motherfuckers,&quot; Saul screamed. &quot;It's a fake. That's not
Rebecca—it's an actress with makeup. You forgot the mole on her hip.&quot;
They could drug his senses but not his mind.</p>
<p>There was a nasty laugh in the darkness. 'Try this one, Saul,&quot; a voice
said coldly.</p>
<p>A new picture slid into view: Adolph Hitler, in full Nazi uniform, and a
naked Rebecca backing up to him, taking his penis in her rectum. Her face showed
both pain and pleasure—and the mole on her hip was visible. Another
fake—Rebecca was born years after Hitler died. But they hadn't produced the
slide in the thirty seconds after his shout, and that meant they knew her body,
intimately. . . . And they also knew how skeptical and quick his mind was, and
were prepared to administer a series of jolts until something got past his
ability to doubt.</p>
<p>&quot;No comment?&quot; the voice asked mockingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe a man who died thirty years ago would be buggering <i>any
</i>woman today,&quot; Saul said drily. &quot;Your tricks are kind of
corny.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, with the vulgar, we must communicate vulgarly,&quot; the
voice replied—and it was almost gentle and pitying this time.</p>
<p>A new picture appeared—and this time, without doubt, it <i>was </i>Rebecca.
But it was Rebecca three years ago, when he first met her. She sat at a table in
a cheap East Village pad, wearing the emaciated and self-pitying look he
remembered from those days; and she was preparing to inject a needle in her arm.
It was the real thing, but the terror was in its implications: <i>they </i>had
been watching him that long ago. Perhaps—it was hard to date the picture
precisely, although he remembered her apartment in those days—they even knew
he would fall in love with her before he knew it himself. No; more likely, a
friend of hers in those days had taken the picture and they had somehow found it
when they became interested in him. Their resources must be fantastic.</p>
<p>A new card came on the screen;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">ONCE A JUNKIE ALWAYS A JUNKIE</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p>A new picture quickly followed: Rebecca, as she looked today, sitting in his
kitchen—with the new cafe curtains they had just hung last week—once again
injecting a needle into her arm.</p>
<p>&quot;You're the vulgar ones, O mighty Illuminati,&quot; Saul said
caustically. &quot;I would have noticed the tracks on her arm, if she was
shooting up again.&quot;</p>
<p>The answer was nonverbal: the picture of Rebecca and the giant black man came
back on the screen, and was im-</p>
<p>mediately followed by a close-up of her face, eyes closed, mouth open
receiving the penis. It was in perfect focus, the work of an artist with the
camera, and he could see no sign of any makeup that would help another woman to
pass as Rebecca. He held to his memory that the mole on her hip was missing,
but, perversely, his mind tasted at last the other possibility—makeup can
change a face, and it can also hide a mole. ... If they wanted him <i>to </i>use
his skepticism, so that they could gradually destroy that, and, in the process,
undermine his total psyche. . . . Another sign came on the screen:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">THAT WE
CAN CALL THESE DELICATE CREATURES OURS BUT NOT THEIR APPETITES</span></p>
<p>Saul remembered, all too well, Rebecca's passion in bed.
&quot;Shakespeare,&quot; he called hoarsely. &quot;Advertising your erudition at
a time like this is worse than vulgarity. It's petit-bourgeois
pretentiousness.&quot;</p>
<p>The answer was brutal: a whole series of slides, maybe fifteen or twenty in
all, cascaded across the screen in such rapid succession that he couldn't
examine them carefully, except that the central character was Rebecca, always
Rebecca, Rebecca with the black giant in other sexual positions, Rebecca with
another woman, Rebecca with Spiro Agnew, Rebecca with a little seven-year-old
boy, Rebecca, Rebecca, in a rising crescendo of perversion and abnormality,
Rebecca with a Saint Bernard dog—and a peppermint-colored sine-wave, part of
the drug still working on him, cutting across the scene. . . .</p>
<p>&quot;The true sadist has style,&quot; Saul gasped fighting for control of
his voice. &quot;You people are about as evil and frightening as a bad
B-movie.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a whirring mechanical sound and a movie began in place of the
slides. It was Rebecca and the Saint Bernard, with several close-ups, and her
expressions were the ones he knew. Could any actress portray another woman's
individual style of sexual response? Yes—if necessary, these people would use
hypnosis to get the effect letter-perfect.</p>
<p>The movie stopped abruptly and the projector had another message for him,
held on the screen for minutes:</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">ONLY THE MADMAN IS ABSOLUTELY SURE</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p>When he realized that there would be no further progress until he spoke, Saul
said coldly, &quot;Very entertaining. Where do I go to crumble into a bundle of
neuroses?&quot;</p>
<p>There was no answer. No sound. Nothing happened. He half-saw a latticework of
red pentagons, but that was the drug—and it helped identify which drug, for
geometric patterns were characteristic of the mescaline experience. As he
considered that, the peppermint sine-waves appeared before the pentagons and the
screen gave him a new message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">HOW MUCH IS THE DRUG?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">HOW MUCH IS OUR TRICKERY?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">HOW MUCH IS REALITY?</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Saul was in Copenhagen, on a cruise boat, passing the mermaid of
the harbor. She turned and looked at him. &quot;This case is fishy,&quot; she
said—and as she opened her mouth a school of guppies swam out. &quot;I'm a
mouth-breeder,&quot; she explained.</p>
<p>Saul had a reproduction of that famous statue in his home (which must be the
source of the hallucination), yet he was strangely disturbed. Her punning words
seemed to conceal a deeper meaning than mere casual references to the <i>Confrontation
</i>bombing . . . something that went back . . . back through his whole life . .
. and explained why he had purchased the statue in the first place.</p>
<p>I'm about to have one of those famous drug insights that hippies always talk
about, he thought. But the mermaid broke apart into pentagons of red, orange,
yellow. . . .</p>
<p>And a unicorn winked at him. &quot;Man,&quot; it said, &quot;am I ever
horny!&quot;</p>
<p>Those sketches I made the other day, Saul thought. . . but the screen asked
him:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">IS THE THOUGHT OF A UNICORN A REAL THOUGHT?</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>... and he suddenly understood for the first time what the words &quot;a real
thought&quot; meant; what Hegel meant by defining the Absolute Idea as pure
thought thinking about pure thought; what Bishop Berkeley meant by denying the
reality of the physical world in seeming contradiction of all human experience
and common sense; what every detective was secretly attempting to detect,
although it was always right out in the open; why he became a detective in the
first place; why the universe itself became; why <i>everything; </i>and then he
forgot it; caught a fleeting glimpse of it again—it had something to do with
the eye at the top of the pyramid; and lost it again in visions of unicorns,
stallions, zebras, bars, bars, bars.</p>
<p>Now his whole visual field was hallucinatory . . . octagons, triangles,
pyramids, organic shapes of embryos and growing ferns. The drug was taking
stronger hold on him. Criminals he had sent to jail appeared—sullen, hating

<p>He<b> </b>laughed to keep from crying. They had touched his deepest doubt
about his job—his career, his life's work— precisely at the time the drug
also was leading him there, with those damnable accusing faces. It was as if
they could read his mind and see his hallucinations. No; it was just one lucky
coincidence, because among all their tricks one was statistically likely to
occur in tandem with an appropriate drug experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saul laughed again, more wildly, almost hysterically; and knew, even more
clearly than before, the tears hiding behind the laughter. Prisons reform
nobody; my life is wasted; I offer society a delusion of security but not a real
service. Worse yet, I have known it for years, and lied to myself. The sense of
total failure and utter bitterness that washed over Saul at that moment was, he
knew, not produced but only magnified by the drug. It had been with him a long,
long time but always pushed aside, brushed away from his attention by
concentrating on something else; the drug merely allowed him (forced him) to
look at the emotion honestly and totally for a few wrenching moments.</p>
<p>A doorway suddenly lit up toward his right and a neon light came on above it,
saying, &quot;Absolution and Redemption.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK,&quot; he said icily, &quot;I'll play the next move.&quot; He opened
the door.</p>
<p>The room was tiny but furnished like the world's most expensive brothel.
Above the fourposter bed was an illustration of Alice and a mushroom labeled
&quot;Eat Me.&quot; And on the bed, stripped of her Playboy costume, pinkly and
beautifully naked with legs spread in anticipation, was the blonde bunny.
&quot;Good evening,&quot; she said speaking rapidly and fixing his eyes with her
own stare, &quot;I'm your Virgin Bunny. Every man wants a Virgin Bunny, to eat
on Easter to celebrate the miracle of the Resurrection. Do you understand the
miracle of the Resurrection, sir? Do you know that nothing is true and
everything is permissible and that a man who dares to break the robot
conditioning of society and commit adultery dies in the moment of orgasm with
his whore and wakes resurrected to a new life? Did they teach you that in <i>shule?
</i>Or did they just fill you with a lot of monogamous Yiddish horseshit?&quot;
Most hypnotists spoke slowly, but she was obtaining the same effect by talking
rapidly. &quot;You thought you were going to eat a dead animal, which is
disgusting even if this crazy society accepts it as normal, but instead you're
going to eat a desirable woman (and fuck her afterward), which is normal even if
this crazy society thinks of it as disgusting. You are one of the Illuminated,
Saul, but you never knew it. Tonight you are going to learn. You are going to
find your real self as you were before your mother and father conceived you. And
I'm not talking about reincarnation. I'm talking about something much more
marvelous.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul found his voice. &quot;Your offer is appreciated but declined,&quot; he
said. &quot;Frankly, I find your tawdry mysticism even more adolescent than your
sentimental vegetarianism and coarse lasciviousness. The trouble with the
Illuminati is that you have no sense of true drama and not even a patina of
subtlety.&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as he spoke, but not with surprise at his
resistance—either she was really alarmed, and sorry for him, or she was a
great actress. &quot;Too bad,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;You've refused Heaven,
so you must travel the harder path through the halls of Hell.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul heard a movement behind him, but before he could turn a sharp sensation
pricked his neck: a needle, another drug. Just as he was guessing they had given
him a stronger psychedelic to escalate the effect, he felt consciousness
slipping away. It was a narcotic or a poison.</p>
<p>The wagon started with a jerk: we were off to see the wizard, the wonderful
wizard of arse. What was it Hagbard had said to me, the first time we met, about
straight lines, courtrooms, and shit? I couldn't remember, my mind drifted,
Joseph K. opening the law books and finding pornographic illustrations (Kafka
knew where it was at), deSade keeping a precise mathematical tally in the
brothel, how many times he flogged the whores, how many times they flogged him,
the Nazis counting every gold filling in the corpses at Auschwitz, Shakespeare
scholars debating about that line in Macbeth (was it benches or banks of time?),
the prisoner may approach the bench, you can bank on it, buddy, bank on it ...
PIGS EAT SHIT PIGS EAT SHIT . . . and Pound wrote &quot;the buggering
bank,&quot; he rejected Freud, but even so he got a whiff of the real secret...
how one homo ominously loopses another....</p>
<p>&quot;My God,&quot; the Englishman said. &quot;When do we get out of the
teargas area?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're out of it,&quot; I told him wearily. &quot;That's regular Chicago
air now. Courtesy of Commonwealth Edison and U.S. Steel over in Gary.&quot;</p>
<p>The McCarthy woman was weeping quietly, although the Mace had worn off by
now. The rest of us rode silently, a little caravan of dried snot and tears, the
parmesan cheese odor of stale vomit, some lingering acrid Mace fumes, the urine
of somebody who had peed himself, and that high sulphur dioxide and
slaughterhouse aroma of Chicago's South Side. The quality of mercy is very
strained; it drippeth like the pus from chancre. Abandon hope all ye who enter
here. Chairman Mao appeared and lectured us: &quot;Ho is just a poetaster. Now,
if you want to hear some real socialist verse, consider <i>my </i>latest
composition:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a young lady from Queens</p>
<p>Who gobbled a plateful of beans</p>
<p>The beans fermented</p>
<p>And she was tormented</p>
<p>By embarrassing sounds in her jeans!</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Indicates the anal orientation of capitalist society,&quot; he explained,
dwindling into a pool of blood on the floor next to the kid with the broken arm.</p>
<p>(In 1923, Adolph Hitler stood beneath a pyramidal altar and repeated the
words of a goat-headed man: <i>&quot;Der Zweck heiligte die Mittel.&quot; </i>James
Joyce, in Paris, scrawled in crayon words that his secretary, Samuel Beckett,
would later type: &quot;Pre-Austeric Man in Pursuit of Pan-Hysteric Woman.&quot;
In Brooklyn, New York, Howard Phillips Lovecraft, returning from a party at
which Hart Crane had been perfectly beastly—thereby confirming Mr. Lovecraft's
prejudice against homosexuals—finds a letter in his mailbox and reads with
some amusement: &quot;Some of the secrets revealed in your recent stories would
better be kept out of the light of print. Believe me, I speak as a friend, but
there are those who would prefer such half-forgotten lore to remain in its
present obscurity, and they are formidable enemies for any man. Remember what
happened to Ambrose Bierce. . . .&quot; And, in Boston, Robert Putney Drake
screams, &quot;Lies, lies, lies. It's all lies. Nobody tells the truth. Nobody
says what he thinks. . . .&quot; His voice trails off.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; Dr. Besetzung says, &quot;you were doing fine. Don't
stop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the use?&quot; Drake replies, drained of anger, turning on the
couch to look at the psychiatrist. &quot;To you, this is just abreaction or
acting-out or something clinical. You can't believe I'm right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps I can. Perhaps I agree more than you realize.&quot; The doctor
looks up from bis pad and meets Drake's eye. &quot;Are you sure you're not just <i>assuming
</i>I'll react like everybody else you've tried to tell this to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you agreed with me,&quot; Drake says carefully, &quot;if you
understood what I'm really saying, you'd either be the head of a bank, out there
in the jungle with my father, grabbing your own share of the loot, or you'd be a
bomb-throwing revolutionary, like those Sacco and Vanzetti fellows. Those are
the only choices that make sense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only choices? One must go to one extreme or the other?&quot;</p>
<p>Drake looks back at the ceiling and talks abstractly. &quot;You had to get an
M.D. long ago, before you specialized. Do you know any case where germs gave up
and went away because the man they were destroying had a noble character or
sweet sentiments? Did the tuberculosis baccilli leave John Keat's lungs because
he had a few hundred great poems still unwritten inside him? You must have read
some history, even if you were never at the front lines like me: do you recall
any battle that refutes Napoleon's aphorism about God always being on the side
of the biggest cannons and the best tacticians? This bolshie in Russia, Lenin,
he has ordered the schools to teach chess to everybody. You know why? He says
that chess teaches the lesson that revolutionaries must learn: that if you don't
mobilize your forces properly, you lose. No matter how high your morality, no
matter how lofty your goal: fight without mercy, use every ounce of
intelligence, or you lose. My father understands that. The people who run the
world have always understood it. A general who doesn't understand it gets broken
back to second lieutenant or worse. I saw a whole platoon wiped out,
exterminated like an anthill under a boot. Not because they were immoral or
naughty or didn't believe in Jesus. Because at that place, on that day, the
Germans had superior fire power. That's the law, the one true law, of the
universe, and everything that contradicts it—everything they teach in schools
and churches—is a lie.&quot; He says the word listlessly now. &quot;Just a
lie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you really believe that,&quot; the doctor asks, &quot;why do you
still have the nightmares and the insomnia?&quot;</p>
<p>Drake's blue eyes stare at the ceiling. &quot;I don't know,&quot; he says
finally. &quot;That's why I'm here.&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;Moon, Simon,&quot; the Desk Sergeant called.</p>
<p>I stepped forward, seeing myself through his eyes: beard, army surplus
clothes, stains all over (my own mucus, somebody else's vomit). The archetypcal
filthy, dirty, disgusting, hippie-commie revolutionary.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;another bright red rose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I usually look neater,&quot; I told him calmly. &quot;You get a bit
messed over when you're arrested in this town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only way you get arrested in this town,&quot; he said, frowning,
&quot;is if you break the laws.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only way you get arrested in Russia is you break the laws,&quot; I
replied cheerfully. &quot;Or by mistake,&quot; I added.</p>
<p>That didn't set well at all. &quot;Wise guy,&quot; he said gently. &quot;We
like wise guys here.&quot; He consulted my charge-slip. &quot;Nice record for
one night, Moon. Rioting, mob action, assaulting an officer, resisting arrest,
disturbing the peace. Nice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't disturbing the peace,&quot; I said. &quot;I was disturbing the
war.&quot; I stole that one-liner from Ammon Hennacy, a Catholic Anarchist that
Mom was always quoting. &quot;The rest of the charges are all bullshit,
too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say, I know <i>you,&quot; </i>he said suddenly. &quot;You're Tim Moon's
son. Well, well, well. A second-generation anarchist. I guess we'll be locking
you up as often as we locked him up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess so,&quot; I said. &quot;At least until the Revolution.
Afterward, we won't be locking you up, though. We're going to establish nice
camps in places like Wisconsin, and send you there <i>free </i>to learn a useful
trade. We believe that all policemen and politicians can be rehabilitated. But
if you don't want to go to the camp and learn a productive trade, you don't have
to. You can live on Welfare.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; he said. &quot;Just like your old man. I
suppose if I looked the other way, while some of the boys took you in back and
worked you over a bit, you'd come out still making wisecracks?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid so,&quot; I smiled. &quot;Irish national character, you
know! We see the funny side of everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said thoughtfully (he was awfully fond of that word),
&quot;I hope you can see the funny side of what comes next. You're going to be
arraigned before Judge Bushman. You'll find yourself wishing you had fallen into
a buzzsaw instead. Give my regards to your father. Tell him Jim O'Malley says
hello.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's dead,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>He looked down at his charge-slips. &quot;Sorry to hear it,&quot; he mumbled.
&quot;Nanetti, Fred,&quot; he bawled, and the kid with the broken arm came
forward.</p>
<p>A patrolman led me to the fingerprint room. This guy was a computer:
&quot;Right hand.&quot; I gave him my right hand. &quot;Left hand.&quot; I gave
him my left hand. &quot;Follow the officer.&quot; I followed the officer, and
they took my picture. We went down some halls to the night court, and in a
lonely section the patrolman suddenly hit me in the lower back with his club,
the exact spot (he knew his business) to give me liver problems for a month. I
grunted but refused to say anything that would set him off and get me another
clout, so he spoke. &quot;Yellow-bellied faggot,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Just like Biloxi, Mississippi: one cop is nice, another is just impersonal, a
third is a mean bastard—and it doesn't really matter. They're all part of the
same machine, and what comes out the end of the gears and levers is the same
product, whatever their attitude is. I'm sure Buchenwald was the same: some of
the guards tried to be as humane as possible, some of them just did their job,
some of them went out of their way to make it worse for the prisoners. It
doesn't matter: the machine produces the effect it was designed for.</p>
<p>Judge Bushman (we slipped him AUM two years later, but that's another story,
coming up on another trip) gave me his famous King Kong scowl. &quot;Here are
the rules,&quot; he said. This is an arraignment. You can enter a plea or stand
mute. If you enter a plea, you retain the right to change it at your trial. When
I set bond, you can be released by paying ten percent to the bailiff. Cash only,
no checks. If you don't have the cash, you go to jail overnight. You people have
the city tied up in knots and the bail bondsmen are too busy to cover every
courtroom, so by sheer bad luck you landed in a courtroom they're not
covering.&quot; He turned to the bailiff. &quot;Charge sheet,&quot; he said. He
read the record of my criminal career as concocted by the arresting officer.
&quot;Five offenses in one night. You're bad medicine, aren't you, Moon? Trial
set for September fifteenth. Bail will be ten thousand dollars. Do you have one
thousand dollars?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; I told him wondering how many times he'd made that speech
tonight.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a moment,&quot; said Hagbard, materializing out of the hallway.
&quot;I can make bail for this man.&quot;</p>
<p>MR. KHARIS: Does Mr. Celine seriously suggest that the United States
Government is in need of a guardian?</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: I am merely offering a way out for your client. Any private
individual with a record of such incessant murder and robbery would be glad to
cop an insanity plea. Do you insist that your client was in full possession of
its reason at Wounded Knee? At Hiroshima? At Dresden?</p>
<p>JUSTICE IMMHOTEP: You become facetious, Mr. Celine.</p>
<p>MR. CELINE: I have never been more serious.</p>
<p>&quot;What is your relationship to this young man?&quot; Bushman asked
angrily. He had been about to come when the cop dragged me off to jail, and he
was strangling in some kind of gruesome S-M equivalent of coitus interruptus.</p>
<p>&quot;He's my wife,&quot; Hagbard said calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Common-law wife,&quot; Hagbard went on. &quot;Homosexual marriage is
not recognized in Illinois. But homosexuality per se isn't a crime in this
state, either, so don't try to make waves, your honor. Let me pay and take him
home.&quot;</p>
<p>It was too much. &quot;Daddy,&quot; I said, camping like our friend the
Padre. &quot;You're so masterful.&quot;</p>
<p>Judge Bushman looked like he wanted to lay Hagbard out with a gavel upside of
his head, but he controlled himself. &quot;Count the money,&quot; he told the
bailiff. &quot;Make sure he pays every penny. And then,&quot; he told us,
&quot;I want the two of you out of this courtroom as quickly as possible. I'll
see <i>you </i>September fifteenth,&quot; he added, to me.</p>
<p>MR. KHARIS: And we believe we have demonstrated the necessity of this dam. We
believe we have shown that the doctrine of eminent domain is on sure
constitutional grounds, and has been held to apply in numerous similar cases. We
believe we have shown that the resettlement plan offered by the government will
be no hardship for the plaintiffs. . . .</p>
<p>&quot;Fuckin' faggots,&quot; the cop said as we went out the door.</p>
<p>&quot;All hail Discordia,&quot; I told him cheerfully. &quot;Let's get out of
this neighborhood,&quot; I added to Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;My car is right here,&quot; he said, pointing to a goddam Mercedes.</p>
<p>&quot;For an anarchist, you sure live a lot like a capitalist,&quot; I
commented as we got into that beautiful machine crystallized out of stolen labor
and surplus value.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not a masochist,&quot; Hagbard replied. &quot;The world makes me
uncomfortable enough. I see no reason to make myself more uncomfortable. And I'm
damned if I'll drive a broken-down jalopy that spends half its time in a garage
being repaired merely because that would make me seem more 'dedicated' to you
left-wing simpletons. Besides,&quot; he added practically, &quot;the police
never stop a Mercedes and search it. How many times a week do you get stopped
and harassed, with your beard and your psychedelic Slaveswagon, you damned
moralist?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Often enough,&quot; I admitted, &quot;that I'm afraid to transport dope
in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This car is full of dope,&quot; he said blithely. &quot;I'm making</p>
<p>a big delivery to a dealer up in Evanston, on the Northwestern campus,
tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're in the dope business, too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm in every illegal business. Every time a government declares
something <i>verboten, </i>two groups! move in to service the black market
created: the Mafia and the LDD. That stands for Lawless Delicacy Dealers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it stood for Little Deluded Dupes.&quot;</p>
<p>He laughed. &quot;Score one for Moon. Seriously, I'm the worst enemy
governments have, and the best protection for the average person. The Mafia has
no ethics, you know. If it wasn't for my group and our years and years of
experience, everything on the black market, from dope to Canadian furs, would be
shoddy and unreliable. We always give the customer his or her money's worth.
Half the dope <i>you </i>sell probably has passed through my agents on its way
to you. The better half.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was that homosexual business? Just buggin' old Bushman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Entropy. Breaking the straight line into a curve ball.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard,&quot; I said, &quot;what the hell is your game?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Proving that government is a hallucination in the minds of
governors,&quot; he said crisply. We turned onto Lake Shore Drive and sped
north.</p>
<p>&quot;Thou, Jubela, did he tell you the Word?&quot; asked the goat-headed
man.</p>
<p>The gigantic black said, &quot;I beat him and tortured him, but he would not
reveal the Word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou, Jubelo, did he tell you the Word?&quot;</p>
<p>The fishlike creature said, &quot;I tormented and vexed his inner spirit,
Master, but he would not reveal the Word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And thou, Jubelum, did he tell you the Word?&quot;</p>
<p>The hunchbacked dwarf said, &quot;I cut off his testicles and he was mute. I
cut off his penis and he was mute. He did not tell me the Word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A fanatic,&quot; the goat-head said. &quot;It is better that he is
dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul Goodman tried to move. He couldn't twitch a single muscle: That last
drug had been a narcotic, and a powerful one. Or was it a poison? He tried to
assure himself that the reason he was paralyzed and laying in a coffin was
because they were trying to break down his mind. But he wondered if the dead
might tell themselves similar fables, as they struggled to escape from the body
before it rotted.</p>
<p>As he wondered, the goat-head leaned over and closed the top of the coffin.
Saul was alone in darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;Leave first, Jubela.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Master.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave next, Jubelo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Master.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave last, Jubelum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Master.&quot;</p>
<p>Silence. It was lonely and dark in the coffin, and Saul couldn't move. Let me
not go mad, he thought.</p>
<p>Howard spotted the <i>Lief Erikson </i>ahead and sang: &quot;Oh, groovy,
groovy, groovy scene/Once again I'll meet Celine.&quot; <i>Maldonado's sleek
Bentley edged up the drive to the home of &quot;America's best-known
financier-philanthropist,&quot; Robert Putney Drake. </i>(Louis marched toward
the Red Widow, maintaining his dignity. An old man in a strange robe pushed to
the front of the crowd, trembling with exaltation. The blade rose: the mob
sucked in its breath. The old man tried to look into Louis's eyes, but the king
could not focus them. The blade fell: the crowd exhaled. As the head rolled into
the basket, the old man raised his eyes in ecstasy and cried out, &quot;Jacques
De Mo-lay, thou art avenged!&quot;) Professor Glynn lectured his class on
medieval history (Dean Deane was issuing the Strawberry Statement on the same
campus at the same time) and said, &quot;The real crime of the Templars,
however, was probably their association. with the Hashishim.&quot; George Dorn,
hardly listening, wondered if he should join Mark Rudd and the others who wanted
to close down Columbia entirely.</p>
<p>&quot;And modern novels are the same,&quot; Smiling Jim went on. &quot;Sex,
sex, sex—and not normal sex even. Every type of perverted, degenerate,
unnatural, filthy, deviated, and sick kind of sex. This is how they're gonna
bury us, as Mr. Khrushchev said, without even firing a shot.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Sunlight awakened Saul Goodman.</i></p>
<p><i>Sunlight and a headache. A hangover from the combination of drugs.</i></p>
<p>He was in a bed and his clothes were gone. There was no mistaking the garment
he wore: a hospital gown. And the room—as he squinted against the sun—had
the dull modern-penitentiary look of a typical American hospital.</p>
<p>He hadn't heard the door open, but a weathered-looking middle-aged man in a
doctor's smock drifted into the room. He was carrying a clipboard; pens stuck
their necks out of his smock pocket; he smiled benignly. His hornrimmed heavily
black glasses and crewcut marked him as the optimistic, upward-mobile man of his
generation, without either the depression/World War II memories that gave
anxiety to Saul's contemporaries or nuclear nightmares that gave rage and
alienation to youth. He would obviously think of himself as a liberal and vote
conservatively at least half the time.</p>
<p>A hopeless schmuck.</p>
<p>Except that he was probably none of those things, but another of their
agents, doing a very convincing performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; he said brightly. &quot;Feeling better, Mr. Muldoon?&quot;</p>
<p>Muldoon, Saul thought. Here we go—another ride into their <i>kitsch </i>idea
of the Heart of Darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;My name is Goodman,&quot; he said thinly. &quot;I'm about as Irish as
Moishe Dayan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, still playing that little game, are we?&quot; the man spoke kindly.
&quot;And are you still a detective?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go to hell,&quot; Saul said, no longer in mood to fight back with wit
and irony. He would dig into his hostility and make his last stand from a
foxhole of bitterness and sullen brevity.</p>
<p>The man pulled up a chair and sat down. &quot;Actually,&quot; he said,
&quot;these remaining symptoms don't bother us much. You were in a much worse
state when you were first brought here six months ago. I doubt that you remember
that. Electroshock mercifully removes a great deal of the near past, which is
helpful in cases like yours. Do you know that you were physically assaulting
people on the street, and tried to attack the nurses and orderlies your first
month here? Your paranoia was very acute at that point, Mr. Muldoon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Up yours, bubi,&quot; Saul said. He closed his eyes and turned the
other way.</p>
<p>&quot;Such moderate hostility these days,&quot; the man went on, bright as a
bird in the morning grass. &quot;A few months ago you would have tried to
strangle me. Let me show you something.&quot; There was a sound of paper.</p>
<p>Curiosity defeated resistance: Saul turned and looked. The man held out a
driver's license, from the State of New</p>
<p>Jersey, for &quot;Barney Muldoon.&quot; the picture was Saul's. Saul grinned
maliciously, showing his disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;You refuse to recognize yourself?&quot; the man asked quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Barney Muldoon?&quot; Saul shot back. &quot;Do you have him in
another room, trying to convince him he's Saul Goodman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where is . . . ?&quot; the &quot;doctor&quot; repeated, seeming
genuinely baffled. &quot;Oh, yes, you admit you know the name but claim he was
only a friend. Just like a rapist we had in here a while ago. He said all the
rapes were committed by his roommate, Charlie. Well, let's try another tack. All
those people you beat up on the street—and that Playboy Club bunny you tried
to strangle—do you still believe they were agents of this, um, Prussian
Illuminati?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is an improvement,&quot; Saul said. &quot;A very intriguing
combination of reality and fantasy, much better than your group's previous
efforts. Let me hear the rest of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think that's sarcasm,&quot; the man said calmly. &quot;Actually,
behind it, your recovery is proceeding nicely. You really want to remember, even
as you struggle to keep up this Goodman myth. Very well: you are a
sixty-year-old police officer from Trenton, New Jersey. You never were promoted
to detective and that is the great grievance of your life. You have a wife named
Molly, and three sons— Roger, Kerry, and Gregory. Their ages are twenty-eight,
twenty-five, and twenty-three. A few years ago, you started a game with your
wife; she thought it was harmless at first and learned to her sorrow that it
wasn't. The game was, that you pretended to be a detective and, late at night,
you would tell her about the important cases you were working on. Gradually, you
built up to the most important case of all—the solution to all the
assassinations in America during the past decade. They were all the work of a
group called the Illuminati, who were surviving top-level Nazis that had never
been captured. More and more, you talked about their leader—Martin Borman, of
course—and insisted you were getting a line on his whereabouts. By the time
your wife realized that the game had become reality to you, it was too late. You
already suspected your neighbors of being Illuminati agents, and your hatred for
Nazism led you to believe you were Jewish and had taken an Irish name to avoid
American anti-Semitism. This particular delusion, I must say, caused you acute
guilt, which it took us a long time to understand. It was, we finally realized,
a projection of a guilt you have long felt for being a policeman at all. But
perhaps at this point, I might aid your struggle for self-recognition (and abort
your equal and opposite struggle for self-escape) by reading you part of a
report on your case by one of our younger psychiatrists. Are you game to hear
it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Saul said. &quot;I still find this entertaining.&quot;
The man looked through the papers in his clipboard and smiled disarmingly.
&quot;Oh, I see here that it's the Bavarian Illuminati, not the Prussian
Illuminati, pardon my mistake.&quot; He flipped a few more pages. &quot;Here we
are,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The root of the subject's problems,&quot; he began to read, &quot;can
be found in the trauma of the primal scene, which was reconstructed under narco-analysis.
At the age of three, he came upon his parents in the act of fellatio, which
resulted in his being locked in his room for 'spying.' This left him with a
permanent horror of being locked up and a pity for prisoners everywhere.
Unfortunately, this factor in his personality, which he might have sublimated
harmlessly by becoming a social worker, was complicated by unresolved Oedipal
hostilities and a reaction formation in favor of 'spying,' which led him to
become a policeman. The criminal became for him the father-symbol, who was
locked up in revenge for locking him up; at the same time, the criminal was an
ego-projection and he received masochistic gratification by identifying with the
prisoner. The deep-buried homosexual desire for the father's penis (present in
all policemen) was next cathected by denial of the father, <i>via </i>denial of
paternal ancestory, and he began to abolish all Irish Catholic traces from
ego-memory, substituting those of Jewish culture, since the Jew, as persecuted
minority, reinforced his basic masochism. Finally, like all paranoids, the
subject fancies himself to be of superior intelligence (actually, on his test
for the Trenton Police Force, he rated only one hundred ten on the Stan-ford-Binet
IQ index) and his resistance to therapy will take the form of 'outwitting' his
doctors by finding the 'clues' which reveal that they, too, are agents of the
Illuminati and that his assumed identity as 'Saul Goodman' is, in fact, his
actual identity. For therapeutic purposes, I would recommend . . .&quot; The
&quot;doctor&quot; broke off. &quot;After that,&quot; he said briefly, &quot;it
is of no interest to you. Well,&quot; he added tolerantly, &quot;do you want to
'detect' the errors in this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've never been in Trenton in my life,&quot; Saul said wearily. &quot;I
don't know what anything in Trenton looks like. But you'll just tell me that
I've erased those memories. Let's move to a deeper level of combat, <i>Herr
Doktor. </i>I am quite convinced that my mother and father never performed
fellatio in their lives. They were too old-fashioned.&quot; This was the heart
of the labyrinth, and their real threat: while he was sure that they could not
break down his belief in his own identity, they were also insidiously
undermining that identity by suggesting it was pathological. Many of the lines
in the Muldoon case history could refer to any policeman and might, conceivably,
refer to him; as usual, behind a weak open attack they were mounting a more
deadly covert attack.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you recognize these?&quot; the doctor asked, producing a sketchbook
open to a page with some drawings of unicorn.</p>
<p>&quot;It's my sketchbook,&quot; Saul said. ''l don't know how you got it but
it doesn't prove a damned thing, except that I sketch in my spare time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No?&quot; The doctor turned the book around; a bookplate on the cover
identified the owner as Barney Muldoon, 1472 Pleasant Avenue, Trenton, NJ.</p>
<p>&quot;Amateur work,&quot; Saul said. &quot;Anybody can paste a bookplate onto
a book.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the unicorn means nothing to you?&quot; Saul sensed the trap and
said nothing, waiting. &quot;You are not aware of the long psychoanalytical
literature on the unicorn as symbol of the father's penis? Tell me, then, why
did you decide to sketch unicorns?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More amateurism,&quot; Saul said. &quot;If I sketched mountains, they
would be symbols of the father's penis, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well. You might have made a good detective if
your—illness—hadn't prevented your promotion. You do have a quick, skeptical
mind. Let me try another approach—and I wouldn't be using such tactics if I
weren't convinced you were on the road to recovery; a true psychotic would be
driven into catatonia by such a blunt assault on his delusions. But, tell me,
your wife mentioned that just before the acute stage of your—problem—you
spent a lot of money, more than you could afford on a patrolman's salary, on a
reproduction of the mermaid of Copenhagen. Why was that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damn it,&quot; Saul exclaimed, &quot;it wasn't a lot of money.&quot;
But he recognized the displaced anger and saw that the other man recognized it
too. He was avoiding the question of the mermaid . . . and her relation to the
unicorn. <i>There must be a relationship between fact number one and fact number
two. . . . </i>&quot;The mermaid,&quot; he said, getting there before the enemy
could, &quot;is a mother symbol, right? She has no human bottom, because the
male child dare not think about that area of the mother. Is that correct
jargon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More or less. You avoid, of course, the peculiar relevance in your own
case: that the sex act in which you caught your mother was not a normal one but
a very perverted and infantile act, which, of course, is the only sex act a
mermaid can perform—as all collectors of mermaid statues or mermaid paintings
unconsciously know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not perverted and infantile,&quot; Saul protested. &quot;Most
people do it....&quot; Then he saw the trap.</p>
<p>&quot;But not <i>your </i>mother and father? They were different from most
people?&quot;</p>
<p>And then it clicked: the spell was broken. Every detail from Saul's notebook,
every physical characteristic Peter Jackson had described, was there.
&quot;You're not a doctor,&quot; he shouted. &quot;I don't know what your game
is but I sure as hell know who you are. You're Joseph Malik!&quot;</p>
<p>George's stateroom was paneled in teak, the walls hung with small but
exquisite paintings by Rivers, Shahn, De Kooning, and Tanguy. A glass cabinet
built into one wall held several rows of books. The floor was carpeted in wine
red with a blue stylized octopus in the center, its waving tentacles radiating
out like a sunburst. The light fixture hanging from the ceiling was a lucite
model of that formidable jellyfish, the Portuguese man-of-war.</p>
<p>The bed was full size, with a rosewood headboard carved with Venetian
seashell motifs. Its legs didn't touch the floor; the whole thing was supported
on a huge, rounded beam that allowed the bed to seesaw when the ship rolled, the
sleeper remaining level. Beside the bed was a small desk. Going to it, George
opened a drawer and found several different sizes of writing paper and half a
dozen felt-tipped pens in various colors. He took out a legal-size pad and a
green pen, climbed on the bed, curled up at the head and began writing.</p>
<p>April 24</p>
<p>Objectivity is presumably the opposite of schizophrenia. Which means that it
is nothing but acceptance of everybody else's notion of reality. But nobody's
perception of reality is the same as everybody's notion of it, which means that
the most objective person is the real schizophrenic.</p>
<p>It is hard to get beyond the accepted beliefs of one's own age. The first man
to think a new thought advances it very tentatively. New ideas have to be around
a while before anyone will promote them hard. In their first form, they are like
tiny, imperceptible mutations that may eventually lead to new species. That's
why cultural cross-fertilization is so important. It increases the gene-pool of
the imagination. The Arabs, say, have one part of the puzzle. The Franks
another. So, when the Knights Templar meet the Hashishim, something new is born.</p>
<p>The human race has always lived more or less happily in the kingdom of the
blind. But there is an elephant among us. A one-eyed elephant.</p>
<p>George put the pen down and read the green words with a frown. His thoughts
still seemed to be coming from outside his own mind. What was that business
about the Knights Templar? He had never felt the slightest interest in that,
period since his freshman year in college, when old Morrison Glynn had given him
a <i>D </i>for that paper on the Crusades. It was supposed to be a simple
research paper displaying one's grasp of proper footnote style, but George had
chosen to denounce the Crusades as an early outbreak of Western racist
imperialism. He'd even gone to the trouble of finding the text of a letter from
Sinan, third leader of the Hashishim, in which he exonerates Richard Coeur de
Lion of any complicity in the murder of Conrad of Montferret, King of Jerusalem.
George felt the episode demonstrated the essential goodwill of the Arabs. How
was he to know that Morrison Glynn was a staunch conservative Catholic? Glynn
claimed, among other dyspeptic criticisms, that the letter from the castle
called Messiac was well known as a forgery. Why were the Hashishim coming back
to mind again? Did it have to do with the weird dream he'd had of the temple in
the Mad Dog jail?</p>
<p>The sub's engine was vibrating pleasantly through the floor, the beam, the
bed. The trip so far had reminded George of his first flight in a 747—a surge
of power, followed by motion so smooth it was impossible to tell how fast or how
far they were going.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the stateroom door, and at George's invitation Hagbard's
receptionist came <i>in. </i>She was wearing a tight-fitting golden-yellow slack
ensemble. She stared compellingly at George, her pupils huge obsidian pools, and
smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you eat me if I can't guess the riddle?&quot; George said.
&quot;You remind me of a sphinx.&quot;</p>
<p>Her lips, the color of ripe grapes, parted in a grin. &quot;I modeled for it.
But no riddle, just an ordinary question. Hagbard wants to know if you need
anything. Anything but me. I've got work to do now.&quot;</p>
<p>George shrugged. &quot;You beat me to the question. I'd like to get together
with Hagbard and find out more about him and the submarine and where we're
going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to Atlantis. He must have told you that.&quot; She shifted
her weight from one foot to the other, rolling her hips. She had marvelously
long legs. &quot;Atlantis is, roughly speaking, about half way between Cuba and
the west coast of Africa, at the bottom of the ocean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, well—That's where it's supposed to be, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right. Hagbard's going to want you in the captain's control room later.
Meanwhile, smoke some of this, if you want. Helps to pass the time.&quot; She
held out a gold cigarette case. George took it from her, his fingers brushing
the velvety black skin of her hand. A pang of desire for her swept through him.
He fumbled with the catch of the case and opened it. There were slender white
tubes inside, each one stamped with a gold <i>K. </i>He took one out and held it
to his nose. A pleasant, earthy smell.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got a plantation and a factory in Brazil,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard must be a wealthy man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yeah. He's worth billions and billions of tons of flax. Well, look,
George, if you need anything, just press the ivory button on your desk. Someone
will come along. We'll be calling you later.&quot; She turned with a languid
wave and walked down the fluorescent-lit corridor. George's gaze clung to her
unbelievable ass till she climbed a narrow flight of carpeted stairs and was out
of sight</p>
<p>What was that woman's name? He lay down on the bed, took out a joint, and lit
it. It was marvelous. He was up in seconds, not the usual gradual balloon
ascent, but a rocket trip, not unlike the effect of amyl nitrate. He might have
known this Hagbard Celine would have something special in the way of grass. He
studied the sparkles glinting through the Portuguese man-of-war and wiggled his
eyeballs rapidly to make the lights dance. All things that are, are lights. The
thought came that Hagbard might be evil. Hagbard was like some robber baron out
of the nineteenth century. Also like some robber baron out of the eleventh
century. The Normans took Sicily in the ninth century. Which gave you mixtures
of Viking and Sicilian, but did they ever look like Anthony Quinn? Or his son
Greg La Strade? What son? What the sun done cannot be undone but is well dun.
The quintessence of evil. Nemesis of all evil. God bless us, every one. Even
One. Odd, the big red one. Eye think it was his I. The eye of Apollo. His
luminous I. Aum Shiva.</p>
<p>—Aye, trust me not. Trust not a man who's rich in flax—his morals may be
sadly lax. Her name is Stella. Stella Maris. Black star of the sea.</p>
<p>The joint was down to the last half inch. He put it down and crushed it out.
With grass flowing like tobacco around here, it was a luxury he could afford. He
wasn't going to light another one. That wasn't a high, that was a trip! A Saturn
rocket, right out of the world. And back, just as fast.</p>
<p>—George, I want you in the captain's control room.</p>
<p>Clearly, this hallucinating of voices and images meant he wasn't all the way
back. Reentry was not completed. He now saw a vision of the layout of that part
of the submarine between his stateroom and the captain's control room. He stood
up, stretched, shook his head, his hair swirling around his shoulders. He walked
to the door, slid it back, and walked on down the hall.</p>
<p>A little later, he stepped through a door onto a balcony which was a
reproduction of the prow of a Viking ship. Above, below, in front, to the sides,
was green-blue ocean. They seemed to be in a glass globe projecting into the
ocean. A long-necked red-and-green dragon with golden eyes and a spiky crest
reared above George and Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;My approach is fanciful, rather than functional,&quot; Hagbard said.
&quot;If I weren't so intelligent, it would get me into a lot of trouble.&quot;
He patted the dragon figurehead with a black-furred hand. Some Viking, George
thought. A Neanderthal Viking, perhaps.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a good trick,&quot; George said, feeling shrewd but still
high. &quot;How you got me up on the bridge with that telepathy thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I called you on the intercom,&quot; Hagbard said, with a look of absurd
innocence.</p>
<p>&quot;You think I can't tell a voice in my head from a voice in my
ears?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard roared with laughter, so loud that it made George feel a little
uncertain. &quot;Not when you've had your first taste of Kallisti Gold,
man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who am I to call a man a liar when he's just turned me on with the best
shit I ever had?&quot; said George with a shrug. &quot;I suspect you of making
use of telepathy. Most people who have that power would not only not try to hide
it, they'd go on television.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, I- put the ocean on television.&quot; said Hagbard. He
gestured at the globe surrounding their Viking prow. &quot;What you see is
simply color television with a few adaptations and modifications. We are inside
the screen. The cameras are all over the surface of the sub. The cameras don't
use ordinary light, of course. If they did, you wouldn't be able to see
anything. The submarine illuminates the sea around us with an infrared
laser-radar to which our TV cameras are sensitive. The radiations are of a type
that is more readily conducted by the hydrogen in water than by any other
element. The result is that we can see the ocean bottom almost as clearly as if
it were dry land and we were in a plane flying above it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That'll make it easy to see Atlantis when we get to it,&quot; George
said. &quot;By the way, why did you say we're going-to Atlantis, again? I didn't
believe it when you told me, and now I'm too stoned to remember.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Illuminati are planning to loot one of the greatest works of art in
the history of man—the Temple of Tethys. It happens to be a solid-gold temple,
and their intention is to melt it down and sell the gold to finance a series of
assassinations in the U.S. I intend to get there before them.&quot;</p>
<p>The reference to assassinations reminded George that he'd gone down to Mad
Dog, Texas, on Joe Malik's hunch that he'd find a clue there to an assassination
conspiracy. If Joe knew that the clue was leading 20,000 leagues under</p>
<p>the sea and eons back through time, would he believe it? George doubted it.
Malik was one of those hard-nosed &quot;scientific&quot; leftists. Though he had
been acting and talking a little strangely lately.</p>
<p>&quot;Who did you say was looting this temple?&quot; he asked Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;The Illuminati. The real force behind all communist and fascist
movements. Whether you're aware of it or not, they're also already in control of
the United States government.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought everybody in your crowd was a right-winger—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I told you spacial metaphors are inadequate in discussing politics
today,&quot; Hagbard interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you sound like a gang of right-wingers. Up until the last minute,
all I've heard from you and your people was that the Illuminati were commies, or
were behind the commies. Now you say they're behind fascism and behind the
current government in Washington, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard laughed. &quot;We came on like right-wing paranoids, at first, to see
how you'd react. It was a test.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You passed. You didn't believe us—that was obvious—but you kept
your eyes and ears open and were willing to listen. If you were a right-winger,
we would have done our pro-communist rap. The idea is to find out if a new man
or woman will listen, really listen, or just shut their minds at the first
really shocking idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm listening, but not uncritically. For instance, if the Illuminati
control America already, what's the purpose of the assassinations?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Their grip on Washington is still pretty precarious. They've been able
to socialize the economy. But if they showed their hand now and went
totalitarian all the way, there would be a revolution. Middle-readers would rise
up with right-wingers, and left-libertarians, and the Illuminati aren't powerful
enough to withstand that kind of massive revolution. But they can rule by fraud,
and by fraud eventually acquire access to the tools they need to finish the job
of killing off the Constitution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What sort of tools?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More stringent security measures. Universal electronic surveillance.
No-knock laws. Stop and frisk laws. Government inspection of first-class mail.
Automatic fingerprint-</p>
<p>ing, photographing, blood tests, and urinalysis of any person arrested before
he is charged with a crime. A law making it unlawful to resist even unlawful
arrest. Laws establishing detention camps for potential subversives. Gun control
laws. Restrictions on travel. The assassinations, you see, establish the need
for such laws in the public mind. Instead of realizing that there is a
conspiracy, conducted by a handful of men, the people reason—or are
manipulated into reasoning—that the entire populace must have its freedom
restricted in order to protect the leaders. The people agree that they
themselves can't be trusted. Targets for assassination will be mavericks of left
or right who are either not part of the Illuminati conspiracy or have been
marked as unreliable. The Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King, for example,
were capable of mobilizing a somewhat libertarian left-right-black-white
populist movement. But the assassinations that have occurred so far are nothing
compared to what will take place. The next wave will be carried out by the
Mafia, who will be paid in Illuminati gold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not Moscow gold,&quot; said George with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;The puppets in the Kremlin have no idea that they and the puppets in
the White House are working for the same people. The Illuminati control all
sorts of organizations and national governments without any of them being aware
that others are also controlled. Each group thinks it is competing with the
others, while actually each is playing its part in the Illuminati plan. Even the
Morituri—the six-person affinity groups which splintered from the SDS
Weathermen, because the Weathermen seemed too cautious—are under the control
of the Illuminati. They think they're working to bring down the government, but
actually they are strengthening its hand. The Black Panthers are also
infiltrated. Everything is infiltrated. At present rate, within the next few
years the Illuminati will have the American people under tighter surveillance
than Hitler had the Germans. And the beauty of it is, the majority of the
Americans will have been so frightened by Illuminati-backed terrorist incidents
that they will beg to be controlled as a masochist begs for the whip.&quot;</p>
<p>George shrugged. Hagbard sounded like a typical paranoid, but there was this
submarine and the strange events of the past few days. &quot;So the Illuminati
are conspiring to tyrannize the world, is that it? Do you trace them back to the
First International?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. They're what happened when the Enlightenment of the eighteenth
century collided with German mysticism. The correct name for the organization is
Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria. According to their own traditions they
were founded or revived in seventeen seventy-six on May first by a man named
Adam Weishaupt. Weishaupt was an unfrocked Jesuit and a Mason. He taught that
religions and national governments had to be overthrown and the world ruled by
an elite of scientifically-minded materialistic atheists, to be held in trust
for the masses of mankind who would eventually rule themselves when
enlightenment became universal. But this was only Weishaupt's 'Outer Doctrine.'
There was also an 'Inner Doctrine,' which was that power is an end in itself,
and that Weishaupt and his closest followers would make use of the new knowledge
being developed by scientists and engineers to seize control of the world. Back
in seventeen seventy-six, things were run largely by the Church and the feudal
nobility, with the capitalists slowly getting a bigger and bigger piece of the
pie. Weishaupt declared that these groups were obsolete, and it was time for an
elite with a monopoly on scientific and technological knowledge to seize power.
Instead of eventually producing a democratic society, as the 'Outer Doctrine'
promised, the Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria would saddle mankind with a
dictatorship that would last forever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it would be logical enough that someone around that time would
think of that,&quot; said George. &quot;And who more likely than a Mason who was
an unfrocked Jesuit?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You recognize that what I tell you is relatively plausible,&quot; said
Hagbard. &quot;That's a good sign.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A sign that it's plausible.&quot; laughed George.</p>
<p>&quot;No, a sign that you're the kind of person I'm always looking for. Well,
the Illuminati, after staying above ground long enough to recruit a hard-core
membership from Masons and freethinkers and to establish international contacts,
allowed it to seem that the Bavarian government had suppressed them.
Subsequently, the Illuminati launched their first experimental revolution, in
France. Here they suckered the middle class, whose true interests lay in laissez
faire free enterprise, to follow the Weishaupt slogan of 'Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity.' The catch, of course, is that where equality and fraternity rule,
there is no liberty. After the career of Napoleon, whose rise and fall was
purely the result of Illuminati manipulations, they started planting the seeds
of European socialism, leading to the revolutions of eighteen forty-eight, to
Marxism, finally to the seizure of Russia, one-sixth of the earth's land mass.
Of course, they had to engineer a world war to make the Russian Revolution
possible, but by nineteen seventeen they had become quite good at that. World
War Two was an even more clever job and resulted in more gains for them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another thing this explains,&quot; George said, &quot;is why orthodox
Marxism-Leninism, in spite of all its ideals, always turns out to be not worth a
shit. Why it's always betrayed the people wherever it established itself. And it
explains why there's such an inevitable quality about America's drift toward
totalitarianism.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;America is the target now. They've got
most of Europe and Asia. Once they get America, they can come out into the open.
The world will then be much as Orwell predicted in <i>Nineteen Eighty-four. </i>They
bumped him off after it was published, you know. The book hit a little too close
to home. He was obviously on to them—the references to Inner and Outer parties
with different teachings, O'Brien's speech about power being an end in
itself—and they got him. Orwell, you see, ran across them in Spain, where they
were functioning quite openly at one point during the Civil War. But artists
also arrive at truth through their imaginations, if they let themselves wander
freely. They're more likely to arrive at the truth than more scientific-minded
people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've just tied two hundred years of world history up in a theory that
would make me feel I should have myself committed if I accepted it,&quot; said
George. &quot;But I'm drawn to it, I admit. Partly intuitively—I feel you are
a person who is essentially sane and not paranoid. Partly because the orthodox
version of history that I was taught in school never made sense to me, and I
know how people can twist history to suit their beliefs, and therefore I assume
that the history I've learned is twisted. Partly because of the very wildness of
the idea. If I learned one thing in the last few years, it's that the crazier an
idea is the more likely it is to be true. Still and all, given all those reasons
for believing you, I would like some further sign.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard nodded. &quot;All right. A sign. So be it. First, a question for you.
Assuming your boss, Joe Malik, was on</p>
<p>to something—assuming that the place he sent you did have something to do
with assassinations and might lead to the Illuminati: what would be likely to
happen to Joe Malik?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know what you're suggesting. I don't like to think about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't think.&quot; Hagbard suddenly pulled a telephone from under the
railing of the ship. &quot;We can tap into the Bell System through the Atlantic
cable from here. Dial the New York area code and dial any person in New York,
any person who could give you up-to-date information on Joe Malik and on <i>Confrontation
</i>magazine. Don't tell me who you're dialing. Otherwise, you might suspect I
had someone on the ship impersonate the person you want to speak to.&quot;</p>
<p>Holding the phone so Hagbard couldn't see, George dialed a number. After a
wait of about thirty seconds, after numerous clicks and other strange sounds,
George could hear a phone ringing. After a moment, a voice said.
&quot;Hello.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is George Dorn,&quot; said George. &quot;Who is this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, who the hell did you think it was? You dialed my number.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Christ,&quot; said George. &quot;Look, I'm in a place where I don't
trust the phones. I have to be sure I'm really talking to you. So I want you to
identify yourself without my telling you who you're supposed to be. Do you
understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I understand. You don't have to use that grade school
language. This is Peter Jackson, George, as I presume you intended that it
should be. Where the hell are you? Are you still in Mad Dog?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Knowing your bad habits, I'm not surprised. Have you heard about what
happened to us? Is that why you're calling?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. What happened?&quot; George gripped the telephone tighter.</p>
<p>&quot;The office was blown up by a bomb early this morning. And Joe has
disappeared.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was Joe killed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not as far as we know. There weren't any bodies in the wreckage. How
about you-—are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm getting into an unbelievable story, Peter. It's so un-</p>
<p>believable that I'm not going to try to tell you about it Not till I get
back. If you're still running a magazine there then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As of now there's still a magazine, and I'm running it from my
apartment,&quot; said Peter. &quot;I only hope they don't decide to blow me
up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoever. You're still on assignment. And if this has anything to do
with what you've been doing down in Mad Dog, Texas, you're in trouble. Reporters
are not supposed to go around getting their boss's magazines bombed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You sound pretty cheerful, considering Joe might be dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Joe is indestructible. By the way, George, who's paying for this
call?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A wealthy friend, I think. He's got a corner on flax or something like
that. More on him later. I'm going to sign off now, Pete. Thanks for
talking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. Take care, baby.&quot;</p>
<p>George handed the phone to Hagbard. &quot;Do you know what's happened to Joe?
Do you know who bombed <i>Confrontation? </i>You knew about this before I
called. Your people are pretty handy with explosives.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard shook his head. &quot;All I know is, the pot is coming to a boil.
Your editor, Joe Malik, was onto the Illuminati. That's why he sent you to Mad
Dog. As soon as you show your face down there, you get busted and Malik's office
is bombed. What do you think?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think that what you've been telling me is the truth, or a version of
it. I don't know whether to trust you completely. But I've got my sign. If the
Bavarian Illuminati don't exist, <i>something </i>does. So, then, where do we go
from here?&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard smiled. &quot;Spoken like a true <i>homo neophilus, </i>George.
Welcome to the tribe. We want to recruit you, because you are so gullible. That
is, gullible in the right way. You're skeptical about conventional wisdom, but
attracted to unorthodox ideas. An unfailing mark of <i>homo neophilus. </i>The
human race is not divided into the irrational and the rational, as some
idealists think. All humans are irrational, but there are two different kinds of
irrationally— those who love old ideas and hate and fear new ones, and those
who despise old ideas and joyfully embrace new ones. <i>Homo neophobus </i>and <i>homo
neophilus. Neophobus</i></p>
<p>is the original human stock, the stock that hardly changed at all for the
first four million years of human history. Neophilus is the creative mutation
that has been popping up at regular intervals during the past million years,
giving the race little forward pushes, the kind you give a wheel to make it spin
faster and faster. Neophilus makes a lot of mistakes, but he or she moves. They
live life the way it should be lived, ninety-nine percent mistakes and one
percent viable mutations. Everyone in my organization is <i>neo-philus, </i>George.
That's why we're so far ahead of the rest of the human race. Concentrated
neophilus influences, without any neophobe dilution. We make a million mistakes,
but we move so fast that none of them catch up with us. Before you get any
deeper, George, I'd like you to become one of us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which means what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Become a Legionnaire in the Legion of Dynamic Discord.&quot;</p>
<p>George laughed. &quot;Now that sounds like a gas. But it's hard to believe
that an organization with an absurd name like that could build anything as
serious as this submarine, or work for such a serious end as foiling the Ancient
Illuminated Seers of Bavaria.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard shook his head. &quot;What's serious about a yellow submarine? It's
right out of a rock song. And everybody knows people who worry about the
Bavarian Illuminati are crackpots. Will you join the Legion—in whatever spirit
you choose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said George promptly.</p>
<p>Hagbard clapped him on the back. &quot;Ah, you're our type, all right. Good.
Back through the door you came, then turn right and through the golden
door.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is there someone lifting a lamp beside it?&quot;</p>
<p>'There are no honest men on this voyage. Get along with you now.&quot;
Hagbard's full lips curled in a leer. &quot;You're in for a treat.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;Every perversion,&quot; Smiling Jim screamed. &quot;Men having sex
with men. Women having sex with women. Obscene desecrations of religious
articles for deviant purposes. Even men and women having sex with animals. Why,
friends, the only thing they haven't gotten around to yet is people copulating
with fruits and vegetables, and I guess that'll be next. Some degenerate getting
his kicks with an apple!&quot; The audience laughed at the wit.)</p>
<p>&quot;You've got to run very fast to catch up with the sun. That's the way it
is, when you're lost out here,&quot; the old woman said, stressing the last five
words in a kind of childish singsong. . . . The woods were incredibly thick and
dark, but Barney Muldoon stumbled after her. . . . &quot;It's getting darker and
darker,&quot; she said darkly, &quot;but's always dark, <i>when you're lost out
here&quot;. . . </i>. &quot;Why do we have to catch the Sun?&quot; Barney asked,
perplexed. &quot;In search of more light,&quot; she cackled gleefully. &quot;You
always need more light, <i>when you're lost out here&quot;...</i>.</p>
<p>Behind the golden door stood the lovely black receptionist. She had changed
into a short red leather skirt that left all of her long legs in view. Her hands
rested lightly on her white plastic belt.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, Stella,&quot; said George. &quot;Is that your name? Is it really
Stella Maris?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No honest men on this voyage is right Hagbard was talking to me
telepathically. He told me your name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told you my name when you boarded the sub. You must have forgotten.
You've been through a lot. And sad to say you'll be going through a lot more. I
must ask you to remove your clothing. Just shed it on the floor, please.&quot;</p>
<p>George unhesitatingly did as he was told. Total or partial nudity was
required in lots of initiation rituals; but a twinge of anxiety ran through him.
He was trusting these people simply because they hadn't done anything to him <i>yet.
</i>But there was really no telling what kind of freaks they might be, what kind
of ritual torture or murder they might involve him in. Such fears were part of
initiation rituals, too.</p>
<p>Stella was grinning at him, eyebrows raised, as he dropped his shorts. He
understood the meaning of the-grin, and he felt the blood rush hot as a blush to
his penis, which grew thicker and heavier in an instant. Being aware that he was
standing nude with the start of an erection in front of this beautiful and
desirable woman, who was enjoying the spectacle, made him swell and harden still
more.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a good-looking tool you've got there. Nice and thick and pink
and purple.&quot; Stella sauntered over to him, reached out and touched her
fingers to the underside of his cock, just where it met his scrotum. He felt his
balls draw up. Then her middle finger ran down the central cord, flicking the
underside of the head. George's penis rose to</p>
<p>full staff in salute to her manual dexterity.</p>
<p>&quot;The sexually responsive male,&quot; said Stella. &quot;Good, good,
good. Now you're ready for the next chamber. Right through that green door, if
you please.&quot;</p>
<p>Naked, erect, regretfully leaving Stella behind, George walked through the
door. These people were too healthy and good-humored to be untrustworthy, he
thought. He liked them and you ought to trust your feelings.</p>
<p>But as the green door slammed shut behind him, his anxiety came back even
stronger than before.</p>
<p>In the center of the room was a pyramid of seventeen steps, alternating red
and white marble. The room was large, with five walls that tapered together in a
gothic arch thirty feet above the pentagonal floor. Unlike the pyramid in the
Mad Dog jail, this one had no huge eye goggling down at him. Instead there was
an enormous golden apple, a sphere of gold the height of a man with a foot-long
stem and a single leaf the size of an elephant's ear. Cut into the side of the
apple was the word KALLISTI in Greek letters. The walls of the room were draped
with enormous gold curtains that looked like they'd been stolen from a Cinerama
theater, and the floor was covered with lush gold carpet into which George's
bare feet sank deeply.</p>
<p>This is different, George told himself to quiet his fear. These people are
different. There's a connection with the others, but they're different.</p>
<p>The lights went out. The golden apple was glowing in the dark like a harvest
moon. KALLISTI was etched in sharp black lines.</p>
<p>A voice that sounded like Hagbard boomed at him from all sides of the room:
&quot;There is no goddess but Goddess, and she is your goddess.&quot;</p>
<p>This is actually an Elks Club ceremony, George thought. But there were
strange, un-BPOE fumes drifting into his nostrils. An unmistakable odor.
High-priced incense these people use. An expensive religion, or lodge, or
whatever it is. But you can afford the best when you're a flax tycoon. Flax,
huh? Hard to see how a man could make such big money in the flax biz. Did you
corner the market, or what? Now, mutual funds, that was more down to earth than
flax. I do believe I'm feeling the effects. They shouldn't drug a man without
his consent.</p>
<p>He found he was holding his penis, which had shrunk considerably. He gave it
a reassuring pull.</p>
<p>Said the voice, &quot;There is no movement but the Discordian movement, and
it is the Discordian movement.&quot;</p>
<p>That would appear to be self-evident. George rolled his eyes and watched the
giant, golden-glowing apple wheel and spin above him.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a most sacred and a most serious hour for Discordians. It is
the hour when the great, palpitating heart of Discordia throbs and swells, when
She What Began It All prepares to ingest into her heaving, chaotic bosom another
Legionnaire of the Legion of Dynamic Discord. O minerval are ye willing to make
a commitment to Discordia?&quot;</p>
<p>Embarrassed at being addressed directly, George let go of his wang.
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, in a voice that sounded muffled to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Are ye a human being, and not a cabbage or something?&quot;</p>
<p>George giggled. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's too bad,&quot; the voice boomed. &quot;Do ye wish to better
yerself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How stupid. Are ye willing to become philosophically illuminated?&quot;</p>
<p>Why that word, George wondered briefly. Why <i>illuminated? </i>But he said,
&quot;I suppose so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very funny. Will ye dedicate yerself to the holy Discordian
movement?&quot;</p>
<p>George shrugged, &quot;As long as it suits me.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a draft against his belly. Stella Maris, naked and gleaming,
stepped out from behind the pyramid. The soft glow from the golden apple
illuminated the rich browns and blacks of her body. George felt the blood
charging back into his penis. This part was going to be <i>OK. </i>Stella walked
toward him With a slow, stately stride, gold bracelets sparkling and tinkling on
her wrists. George felt hunger, thirst, and a pressure as if a balloon were
slowly being inflated in his bowels. His cock rose, heartbeat by heartbeat. The
muscles in his buttocks and thighs tightened, relaxed, and tightened again.</p>
<p>Stella approached with gliding steps and danced around him in a circle, one
hand reaching out to brush his bare waist. He stepped forward and held out his
hands to her. She danced away on tiptoes, spinning, arms over her head, heavy
conical breasts with black nipples tilted upward. For once George understood why
some men like big boobs.</p>
<p>His eyes moved to the globes of her buttocks, the long muscular shadows in
her thighs and calves. He stumbled toward her. She stopped suddenly, legs
slightly apart forming an inverse with her patch of very abundant hair at the
Royal Arch, her hips swaying in a gentle circular motion. His tool pulled him to
her as if it were iron and she were magnetized; he looked down and saw that a
little pearl of fluid, gleaming gold in the light from the apple, had appeared
in the eye. Polyphemus wanted very much to get into the cave.</p>
<p>George walked up to her until the head of the serpent was buried in the
bushy, prickly garden at the bottom of her belly. He put his hands out and
pressed them against the two cones, feeling her ribcage rise and fall with heavy
breathing. Her eyes were half closed and her lips slightly open. Her nostrils
flared wide.</p>
<p>She licked her lips and he felt her fingers lightly circling his cock,
lightly brushing it with a friction strong enough to gently electrify it. She
stepped back a bit and pushed her finger into the moisture on his tip. George
put his hand into the tangle of her pubic hair, feeling the lips hot and
swollen, feeling her juices slathering his fingers. His middle finger slid into
her cunt, and he pushed it in past the tight opening all the way up to his
knuckle. She gasped, and her whole body writhed around his finger in a spiral
motion. &quot;Wow, God!&quot; George whispered. &quot;Goddess!&quot; Stella
answered fiercely. George nodded. &quot;Goddess,&quot; he said hoarsely, meaning
Stella as much as the legendary Discordia.</p>
<p>She smiled and drew away from him. 'Try to imagine that this is not me,
Stella Maris, the youngest daughter of Discordia. She is merely the vessel of
Goddess. Her priestess. Think of Goddess. Think of her entering me and acting
through me. I <i>am </i>her now!&quot; All the while she was stroking Polyphemus
gently but insistently. It was already ferocious as a stallion, but it seemed to
be getting more inflamed, if that were possible.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to go off in your hand in a second,&quot; George moaned. He
gripped her slender wrist to stop her. &quot;I've <i>got to fuck you, </i>whoever
you are, woman or goddess. <i>Please.&quot;</i></p>
<p>She stepped back from him, her tan palms turned toward him, her arms held
away from her sides in a receiving, accepting gesture. But she said, &quot;Climb
the steps now. Climb up to the apple.&quot; Her feet twinkling on the thick
carpet, she ran backward away from him and disappeared behind the pyramid.</p>
<p>He climbed the seventeen steps, old one-eye still swollen and aching. The top
of the pyramid was broad and flat, and he stood facing the apple. He put a hand
out and touched it, expecting cold metal, surprised when the softly glowing
texture felt warm as a human body to his touch. About half a foot below the
level of his waist he saw a dark, elliptical opening in the side of the apple,
and a sinister suspicion formed in his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;You got it, George&quot; said the booming voice that presided over his
initiation. &quot;Now you're supposed to plant your seeds in the apple. Go to
it, George. Give yourself to Goddess.&quot;</p>
<p>Shit man, George thought. What a silly idea! They get a guy turned on like
this and then they expect him to fuck a goddamn golden idol. He had a good mind
to turn his back on the apple, sit down on the top step of the pyramid and
jack-off to show them what he thought of them.</p>
<p>&quot;George, would we let you down? It's nice there in the apple. Come on,
stick it in. Hurry up.&quot;</p>
<p>I am so gullible, thought George. But a hole is a hole. It's all friction. He
stepped up to the apple and gingerly placed the tip of his cock in the
elliptical opening, half expecting to be sucked in by some mechanical force,
half fearing it would be chopped off by a miniature guillotine. But there was
nothing. His cock didn't even touch the edges of the hole. He took another small
step, and put it halfway in. Still nothing. Then something warm and wet and
hairy squirmed up against the tip of his cock. And, whatever it was, he felt it
give as he reflexively pushed forward. He pushed some more and it pushed back,
and he slid into it. A cunt by all the high hidden Gods, a cunt!— and by the
feel it was almost surely Stella's.</p>
<p>George exhaled a deep sigh, planted his hands on the smooth surface of the
apple to support himself and began thrusting. The pumping from inside the apple
was as fierce. The metal was warm against his thighs and belly. Suddenly the
pelvis inside slammed up against the hole, and a hollow scream resounded from
the inside of the apple. The echo effect made it seem to hang in the air,
containing all the agony, spasm, itch, twitch, moon madness, horror, and ecstasy
of life from the ocean's birth to now.</p>
<p>George's prick was stretched like the skin of a balloon about to burst. His
lips drew back from his teeth. The delicious electricity of orgasm was building
in his groin, in the deepest roots of his penis, in his quick. He was coming. He
cried out as he fired his seed into the unseen cunt, into the apple, into
Goddess, into eternity.</p>
<p>There was a crash above. George's eyes opened. A nude male body at the end of
a rope came hurtling at him from the vaulted ceiling. It jerked to a stop with a
horrible crack, its feet quivering above the stem of the apple. Even as the
leaps of ejaculation still racked George's body, the penis over his head lifted
and spurted thick white gobbets of come, like tiny doves, arcing out over
George's uplifted, horrified head to fall somewhere on the side of the pyramid.
George stared at the face, canted to one side, the neck broken, a hangman's knot
behind the ear. It was his own face.</p>
<p>George went ape. He pulled his penis out of the apple and nearly fell
backward down the stairs. He ran down the seventeen steps and looked back. The
dead figure was still hanging, through a trap in the ceiling, directly above the
apple. The penis had subsided. The body slowly rotated. Enormous laughter boomed
out in the room, sounding very much like Hagbard Celine.</p>
<p>&quot;Our sympathies,&quot; said the voice. &quot;You are now a legionnaire
in the Legion of Dynamic Discord.&quot;</p>
<p>The hanging figure vanished soundlessly. There was no trapdoor in the
ceiling. A colossal orchestra somewhere began to play <i>Pomp and Circumstance. </i>Stella
Maris came round from the back of the pyramid again, this time clothed from head
to foot in a simple white robe. Her eyes shone. She was carrying a silver tray
with a steaming hot towel on it. She put the tray on the floor, knelt, and
wrapped George's relaxing dick in the towel. It felt delicious.</p>
<p>&quot;You were beautiful,&quot; she whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, but—wow!&quot; George looked up at the pyramid. The golden
apple gleamed cheerfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Get up off the floor,&quot; he said. &quot;You're embarrassing
me.&quot;</p>
<p>She stood up smiling at him, the broad grin of a woman whose lover has
thoroughly satisfied her.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad you liked it,&quot; said George, his wildly disparate</p>
<p>emotions gradually coalescing as anger. &quot;What was the idea of that last
little gag? To turn me off permanently on sex?&quot;</p>
<p>Stella laughed. &quot;George, admit it. Nothing could turn you off sex,
right? So don't be such a bad sport.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bad <i>sport? </i>That sick trick is your idea of sport? What a goddam
rotten dirty motherfucking thing to do to a man!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Motherfucking? No, that's for when we ordain deacons.&quot;</p>
<p>George shook his head angrily. She absolutely refused to be shamed. He was
speechless.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have any complaints, sweet man, take them to Episkopos Hagbard
Celine of the <i>Lief Erikson </i>Cabal,&quot; said Stella. She turned and
started walking back toward the pyramid. &quot;He's waiting for you back the way
you came. And there's a change of clothes in the next room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; George called after her. &quot;What the blazes
does <i>Kallisti </i>mean?&quot;</p>
<p>She was gone.</p>
<p>In the anteroom of the initiation chamber he found a green tunic and tight
black trousers draped over a costum-er. He didn't want to put them on. It was
probably some sort of uniform of this idiotic cult, and he wanted no part of it.
But there weren't any other clothes. There was also a beautiful pair of black
boots. Everything fit perfectly and comfortably. There was a full-length mirror
on the wall and he looked at himself and grudgingly admitted that the outfit was
a gas. A tiny golden apple glinted on the left side of his chest. The only thing
was that his hair needed washing. It was getting stringy.</p>
<p>Through two more doors and he was facing Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't like our little ceremony?&quot; said Hagbard with
exaggerated sympathy. &quot;That's too bad. I was so proud of it, especially the
parts I lifted from William Burroughs and the Marquis de Sade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's <i>sick,&quot; </i>said George. &quot;And putting the woman inside
the apple so I couldn't have any kind of personal sex with her, so I had to <i>use
</i>her as a receptacle, as, as an <i>object. </i>You made it pornographic. And
sadistic pornography, at that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dig, George,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Thou art that. If there were no
death, there would be no sex. If there were no sex, there would be no death. And
without sex, there</p>
<p>would be no evolution toward intelligence, no human race. Therefore death is
necessary. Death is the price of orgasm. Only one being on all this planet is
sexless, intelligent and immortal. While you were pumping your seeds into the
symbol of life, I showed you orgasm and death in one image and brought it home
to you. And you'll never forget it. It was a trip, George. Wasn't it a
trip?&quot;</p>
<p>George nodded reluctantly. &quot;It was a trip.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you know—in your bones—a little more about life than you did
before, right, George?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, thank you for joining the Legion of Dynamic Discord.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard beckoned George to the edge of the boat-shaped balcony. He pointed
down. Far below in the blue-green medium through which they seemed to be flying
George could see rolling lands, hills, winding riverbeds— and then, broken
buildings. George gasped. Pyramids rose up below, as high as the hills.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the great port cities,&quot; Hagbard said. &quot;Galleys
from the Americas plied their trade to and from this harbor for a thousand
years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long ago?&quot;</p>
<p>'Ten thousand years,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;This was one of the last
cities to go. Of course, their civilization had declined quite a bit by then.
Meanwhile, we've got a problem. The Illuminati are here already.&quot;</p>
<p>A large, undulating, blue-gray shape appeared ahead of them, swam toward
them, whirled and matched their speed so it seemed to drift alongside. George
felt another momentary leap of fright. Was this another of Hagbard's tricks?</p>
<p>&quot;What is that fish? How does it keep up with us?&quot; George asked.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a porpoise, not a fish, a mammal. And they can swim a lot faster
than submarines can sail underwater. We can keep up with them, though. They form
a film around their bodies that enables them to slide through the water without
setting up any turbulence. I learned from them how to do it, and I applied it to
this sub. We can cross the Atlantic under water in less than a day.&quot;</p>
<p>A voice spoke from the control panel. &quot;Better go transparent. You'll be
within range of their detectors when you've gone another ten miles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;We will maintain present course until
further notice, so you'll know where we are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll know,&quot; said the voice.</p>
<p>Hagbard slashed his hand through the air disgustedly. &quot;You're so fucking
<i>superior.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Who are you talking to?&quot; said George.</p>
<p>&quot;Howard.&quot;</p>
<p>The voice said, &quot;I've never seen machines like this before. They look
something like crabs. They've just about got the temple all dug up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When the Illuminati do something on their own, they go first
class,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;Who the hell is Howard?&quot; said George.</p>
<p>&quot;It's me. Out here. Hello, Mr. Human,&quot; said the voice. &quot;I'm
Howard.&quot;</p>
<p>Unbelieving, yet knowing quite well what was happening, George slowly turned
his head. The dolphin appeared to be looking at him.</p>
<p>&quot;How does he talk to us?&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>&quot;He's swimming alongside the prow of the submarine, which is where we
pick up his voice. My computer translates from Delphine to English A mike here
in the control room sends our voices to the computer which translates into
Delphine and broadcasts the correct sounds through the water to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lady-oh, oh de-you-day, a new human being has come my way,&quot; Howard
sang. &quot;He has swum into my ken. I hope he's one of the friendly men.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They sing a lot,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;Also recite poetry and make
it up on the spot. A large part of their culture is poetry. Poetics and
athletics—and, of course, the two are very closely related. What they do
mostly is swim, hunt, and communicate with each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we do all with artful complexity and rare finesse,&quot; said
Howard, looping the loop outside.</p>
<p>&quot;Lead us to the enemy, Howard,&quot; said Hagbard.</p>
<p>Howard swam out in front of them, and as he did so, he sang:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right on, right on, a-stream against the foe</p>
<p>The sallying schools of the Southern seas make their</p>
<p>course to go. Attack, attack, with noses sound as rock</p>
<p>No shark or squid can shake us loose or survive our dour shock.</p>
<p>&quot;Epics,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;They're mad for epics. They have their
whole story for the past forty thousand years in epic form. No books, no
writing—how could they handle pens with their fins, you know? All
memorization. Which is why they favor poetry. And their poems are marvelous, but
you must spend years studying their language before you know that. Our computer
turns their works into doggerel. It's the best it can do. When I have the time,
I'll add some circuits that can really translate poetry from one language to
another. When the Porpoise Corpus is translated into human languages, it will
advance our culture by centuries or more. It will be as if we'd discovered the
works of a whole race of Shakespeares that had been writing for forty
millennia.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand,&quot; said Howard, &quot;your civilizations may be
demoralized by culture shock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not likely,&quot; said Hagbard grumpily. &quot;We've a few things to
teach you, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And our psychotherapists can help you over the anguish of digesting our
knowledge,&quot; said Howard.</p>
<p>&quot;They have psychotherapists?&quot; said George.</p>
<p>&quot;They invented psychoanalysis thousands of years ago as a means of
passing the time on long migrations. They have highly complex brains and
symbol-systems. But their minds are unlike ours in very important ways. They are
all in one piece, so to speak. They lack the structural differentiation of ego,
superego, and id. There is no repression. They are fully aware, and accepting,
of their most primitive wishes. And conscious will, rather than
parent-inculcated discipline, guides their actions. There is no neurosis, no
psychosis among them. Psychoanalysis for them is an imaginative poetic exercise
in autobiography, rather than a healing art. There are no difficulties of the
mind that require healing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not quite true,&quot; said Howard. &quot;There was a school of thought
about twenty thousand years ago that envied humans. They were called the
Original Sinners, because they were like the first parents of your human race
who, according to some of your legends, envied the gods and suffered for it.
They taught that humans were superior because they could do many more things
than dolphins. But</p>
<p>they despaired, and most ended up by committing suicide. They were the only
neurotics in the long history of porpoises. Our philosophers mostly hold that we
live in beauty all the days of our lives, as no human does. Our culture is
simply what you might call a commentary on our natural surroundings, whereas
human culture is at war with nature. If any race is afflicted, it is yours. You
can do much, and what you can do, you must do. And, speaking of war, the enemy
lies ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>In the distance George could make out what appeared to be a mighty city
rising on hills surrounding a deep depression which must have been a harbor when
Atlantis was on the surface. The buildings marched on and on as far as the eye
could see. They were mostly low, but here and there a square tower reared up.
The sub was heading for the center of the ancient waterfront. George stared at
the buildings; he was able to see them better now. They were angular, very
modern in appearance, whereas the other city they'd flown—sailed—over had a
mixed Greek-Egyptian-Mayan quality to its architecture. Here there were no
pyramids. But the tops of many of the structures were broken off, and many
others were heaps of rubble. Still, it was remarkable that a city which had sunk
so many thousands of feet to the bottom of the ocean in the course of what must
have been an enormous earthquake should be this well preserved. The buildings
must be incredibly durable. If New York went through a catastrophe like that
there'd be nothing left of its glass-and-alloy skyscrapers.</p>
<p>There was one pyramid. It was much smaller than the towers around it. It
gleamed a dull yellow. Despite its lack of height, it seemed to dominate the
harbor skyline, like a squat, powerful chieftain in the center of a circle of
tall, slender warriors. There was movement around its base.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the city of Peos in the region of Poseida,&quot; said Hagbard,
&quot;and it was great in Atlantis for a thousand years after the hour of the
Dragon Star. It reminds me of Byzantium, which was a great city for a thousand
years after the fall of Rome. And that pyramid is the Temple of Tethys, goddess
of the Ocean Sea. It was seafaring that made Peos great. I .have a soft spot in
my heart for those people.&quot;</p>
<p>Crawling around the base of the temple were strange sea creatures that looked
like giant spiders. Lights flashed from their heads and glinted on the sides of
the temple. As</p>
<p>the submarine swept closer, George could see that the spiders were machines,
each with a body the size of a tank. They appeared to be excavating deep
trenches around the base of the pyramid.</p>
<p>&quot;Wonder where they had those built,&quot; muttered Hagbard. &quot;Hard
to keep innovations like that a secret.&quot;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the spiders stopped whatever work they were doing around the
pyramid. There was no motion among them at all for a moment Then one of them
rose up from the sea bottom, followed by another, and another. They formed
quickly into a V shape and started toward the submarine like a pair of arms
outstretched to seize it. They picked up speed as they came.</p>
<p>&quot;They've detected us,&quot; Hagbard growled. &quot;They weren't supposed
to, but they have. It never pays to underestimate the Illuminati. All right,
George. Button up your asshole. We're in for a fight.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment but exactly two hours earlier on the clock, Rebecca Goodman
awoke from a dream about Saul and a Playboy bunny and something sinister. The
phone was ringing (was there a pyramid in the dream?—she tried to
remember—something like that) and she reached grog-gily past the mermaid
statue and held the receiver to her ear. &quot;Yes?&quot; she said cautiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Put your hand on your pussy and listen,&quot; said August Personage.
&quot;I'd like to lift your dress and—&quot; Rebecca hung up.</p>
<p>She suddenly remembered the hit when the needle went in, and all those wasted
years. Saul had saved her from that, and now Saul was gone and strange voices on
the phone talked of sex the way addicts talked of junk. &quot;In the beginning
of all things was Mummu, the spirit of pure Chaos. In the beginning was the
Word, and it was written by a baboon.&quot; Rebecca Goodman, twenty-five years
old, started to cry. If he's dead, she thought, these years have been wasted,
too. Learning to love. Learning that sex was more than another kind of junk.
Learning that tenderness was more than a word in the dictionary: that it was
just what D. H. Lawrence said, not an embellishment on sex but the center of the
act. Learning what that poor guy on the phone could never guess, as most people
in this crazy country never guessed it. And then losing it, losing it to an
aimless bullet fired from a blind gun somewhere.</p>
<p>August Personage, about to leave the phone booth at the Automat on Fortieth
Street and the Avenue of the Americas, catches a flash of plastic on the floor.
Bending, he picks up a pornographic tarot card, which he quickly shoves into a
pocket to be examined at leisure later.</p>
<p>It was the Five of Pentacles.</p>
<p>And, when the throne room was empty and the believers had departed in wonder
and redoubled faith, Hassan knelt and separated the two halves of the vessel
which held the head of Ibn Azif. &quot;Very convincing screams,&quot; he
commented, slipping the trapdoor beneath the plate; and Ibn Azif climbed out,
grinning at his own performance. His neck was thick, bull-like, undamaged, and
quite solid.</p>
