<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">THE TACTICS OF MAGICK</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The human brain evidently operates on some variation of the famous principle
enunciated in <i>The Hunting of the Snark: </i>&quot;What I tell you three times
is true.&quot;</p>
<p>—NORBERT WEINER, <i>Cybernetics</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important idea in the <i>Book of Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage
</i>is the simple-looking formula &quot;Invoke often.&quot;</p>
<p>The most successful form of treatment for so-called mental disorders, the
Behavior Therapy of Pavlov, Skinner, Wolpe, et al., could well be summarized in
two similar words: &quot;Reinforce often.&quot; (&quot;Reinforcement,&quot; for
all practical purposes, means the same as the layman's term &quot;reward.&quot;
The essence of Behavior Therapy is rewarding desired behavior; the behavior
&quot;as if by magic&quot; begins to occur more and more often as the rewards
continue.)</p>
<p>Advertising, as everybody knows, is based on the axiom &quot;Repeat
often.&quot;</p>
<p>Those who think they are &quot;materialists&quot; and think that
&quot;materialism&quot; requires them to deny all facts which do not square with
their definition of &quot;matter&quot; are loath to admit the well-documented
and extensive list of individuals who have been cured of serious maladies by
that very vulgar and absurd form of magick known as Christian Science.
Nonetheless, the reader who wants to understand this classic work of immortal
literature will have to analyze its deepest meanings, guided by an awareness
that there is no essential difference between magick, Behavior Therapy,
advertising, and Christian Science. All of them can be condensed into
Abra-Melin's simple &quot;Invoke often.&quot;</p>
<p>Reality, as Simon Moon says, is thermoplastic, not thermosetting. It is not
quite Silly-Putty, as Mr. Paul Krassner once claimed, but is much closer to
Silly-Putty than we generally realize. If you are told often enough that
&quot;Budweiser is the king of beers,&quot; Budweiser will eventually taste
somewhat better—perhaps a great deal better—than it tasted before this
magick spell was cast. If a behavior therapist in the pay of the communists
rewards you every time you repeat a communist slogan, you will repeat it more
often, and begin to slide imperceptibly toward the same kind of belief that
Christian Scientists have for their mantras. And if a Christian Scientist tells
himself every day that his ulcer is going away, the ulcer will disappear more
rapidly than it would have had he not subjected himself to this homemade
advertising campaign. Finally, if a magician invokes the Great God Pan often
enough, the Great God Pan will appear just as certainly as heterosexual behavior
appears in homosexuals who are being handled (or manhandled) by Behavior
Therapy.</p>
<p>The opposite and reciprocal of &quot;Invoke often&quot; is &quot;Banish
often.&quot;</p>
<p>The magician wishing for a manifestation of Pan will not only invoke Pan
directly and verbally, create Panlike conditions in his temple, reinforce Pan
associations in every gesture and every article of furniture, use the colors and
perfumes associated with Pan, etc.; he will also banish other gods verbally,
banish them by removing their associated furnitures and colors and perfumes, and
banish them in every other way. The Behavior Therapist calls this &quot;negative
reinforcement,&quot; and in treating a patient who is afraid of elevators he
will not only reinforce (reward) every instance in which the patient rides an
elevator without terror, but will also negatively reinforce (punish) each
indication of terror shown by the patient. The Christian Scientist, of course,
uses a mantra or spell which both reinforces health and negatively reinforces
(banishes) illness.* Similarly, a commercial not only motivates the listener
toward the sponsor's product but discourages interest in all &quot;false
gods&quot;- by subsuming them under the rubric of the despised and contemptible
Brand X.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* The basic Christian Science mantra, known as
&quot;The Scientific Statement of Being,&quot; no less, is as follows:
&quot;There is no life, truth, intelligence nor substance in matter. All is
infinite mind and its infinite manifestation, for God is all in all, Spirit is
immortal truth: matter is mortal error. Spirit is the real and eternal; matter
is the unreal and temporal. Spirit is God and man is His image and likeness.
Therefore man is not material, he is spiritual.&quot; The fact that these
statements are, in terms of the scientific criteria, &quot;meaningless,&quot;
&quot;non-operational,&quot; and &quot;footless&quot; is actually totally
irrelevant. <i>They work. </i>Try them and see. As Aleister Crowley, no friend
of Mrs. Eddy's, wrote, &quot;Enough of Because! May he be damned for a
dog!&quot;</span></p>
<p>Hypnotism, debate, and countless other games have the same mechanism: <i>Invoke
often </i>and <i>Banish often.</i></p>
<p>The reader who seeks a deeper understanding of this argument can obtain it by
putting these principles to the test. If you are afraid that you might, in this
Christian environment, fall into taking the Christian Science mantra too
seriously, try instead the following simple experiment. For forty days and forty
nights, begin each day by invoking and praising the world in itself as an
expression of the Egyptian deities. Recite at dawn:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bless Ra, the fierce sun burning bright I bless Isis-Luna in the night I
bless the air, the Horus-hawk I bless the earth on which I walk</p>
<p>Repeat at moonrise. Continue for the full forty days and forty nights. We say
without any reservations that, at a minimum, you will feel happier and more at
home in this part of the galaxy (and will also understand better Uncle John
Feather's attitude toward our planet); at maximum, you may find rewards beyond
your expectations, and will be converted to using this mantra for the rest of
your life. (If the results are exceptionally good, you just might start
believing in ancient Egyptian gods.)</p>
<p>A selection of magick techniques which will offend the reason of no
materialist can be found in Laura Archera Huxley's <i>You Are Not the Target </i>(a
powerful mantra, the title!), in <i>Gestalt Therapy, </i>by Peris, Heferline,
and Goodman, and in <i>Mind Games, </i>by Masters and Houston.</p>
<p>All this, of course, is programming your own trip by manipulating appropriate
clusters of word, sound, image, and emotional <i>(prajna) </i>energy. The aspect
of magick which puzzles, perplexes, and provokes the modern mentality is that in
which the operator programs somebody else's trip, <i>acting at a distance. </i>It
is incredible and insulting, to this type of person, if one asserts that our Mr.
Nkrumah Fubar could program a headache for the President of the United States.
He might grant that such manipulating of energy is possible if the President was
told about Mr. Fubar's spells, but he will not accept that it works just as well
when the subject has no conscious knowledge of the curse.</p>
<p>The magical theory that 5 = 6 has no conviction for such a skeptic, and
magicians have not yet proposed a better theory. The materialist then asserts
that all cases where magic did appear to work under this handicap are illusions,
delusions, hallucinations, &quot;coincidences,&quot;* misapprehensions,
&quot;luck,&quot; accident, or downright hoax.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* </span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Look
up the etymology of that word some time and see if it means anything.</span></p>
<p>He does not seem to realize that asserting this is equivalent to asserting
that reality is, after all, thermoplastic—for he is admitting that many people
live in a different reality than his own. Rather than leave him to grapple as
best he can with this self-contradiction, we suggest that he consult <i>Psychic
Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain, </i>by Ostrander and Schroder—especially
Chapter 11, &quot;From Animals to Cybernetics: The Search for a Theory of
Psi.&quot; He might realize that when &quot;matter&quot; is fully understood,
there is nothing a materialist need reject in magick <i>action at a distance, </i>which
has been well explored by scientists committed to the rigid Marxist form of
dialectical materialism.</p>
<p>Those who have kept alive the ancient traditions of magick, such as the Ordo
Templi Orientalis, will realize that the essential secret is sexual (as Saul
tries to explain in the Sixth Trip) and that more light can be found in the
writings of Wilhelm Reich, M. D., than in the current Soviet research. But Dr.
Reich was jailed as a quack by the U.S. Government, and we would not ask our
readers to consider the possibility that the U.S. Government could ever be Wrong
about anything.</p>
<p>Any psychoanalyst will guess at once the most probable symbolic meanings of
the Rose and the Cross; but no psychologist engaged in psi research has applied
this key to the deciphering of traditional magic texts. The earliest reference
to freemasonry in English occurs in Andersen's &quot;Muses Threnody,&quot; 1638:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For we be brethren of the Rosey Cross We have the Mason Word and second sight
but no parapsychologist has followed up the obvious clue contained in this
conjunction of the vaginal rose, the phallic cross, the word of invocation, and
the phenomenon of thought projection. That the taboos against sexuality are
still latent in our culture explains part of this blindness; fear of opening the
door to the most insidious and subtle forms of paranoia is another part. (<i>If</i>
<i>the magick can work at a distance, </i>the repressed thought goes, <i>which
of its is safe?) </i>A close and objective study of the anti-LSD hysteria in
America will shed further light on the mechanisms of avoidance here discussed.</p>
<p>Of course, there are further offenses and affronts to the rationalist in the
deeper study of magick. We all know, for instance, that words are only arbitrary
conventions with no intrinsic connection to the things they symbolize, yet
magick involves the use of words in a manner that seems to imply that some such
connection, or even identity, actually exists. The reader might analyze some
powerful bits of language not generally considered magical, and he will find
something of the key. For instance, the 2 + 3 pattern in &quot;Hail Eris'/'All
hail Discordia&quot; is not unlike the 2 + 3 in &quot;Holy Mary, Mother of
God,&quot; or that in the &quot;L.S./M.F.T.&quot; which once sold many cartons
of cigarettes to our parents; and the 2 + 3 in Crowley's &quot;Io Pan! Io Pan
Pan!&quot; is a relative of these. Thus, when a magician says that you <i>must </i>shout
&quot;Abrahadabra,&quot; and no other word, at the most intensely emotional
moment in an invocation, he exaggerates; you may substitute other words; but you
will abort the result if you depart too far from the five-beat pattern of
&quot;Abrahadabra.&quot;*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* A glance at the end of Appendix Beth will
save the reader from misunderstanding the true tenor of these remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* Aleister Crowley again, under another
pen-name.</span></p>
<p>But this brings us to the magical theory of reality.</p>
<p>Mahatma Guru Sri Paramahansa Shivaji* writes in <i>Yoga for Yahoos:</i></p>
<p>Let us consider a piece of cheese. We say that this has certain qualities,
shape, structure, color, solidity, weight, taste, smell, consistency and the
rest; but investigation has shown that this is all illusory. Where are these
qualities? Not in the cheese, for different observers give quite different
accounts of it. Not in ourselves, for we do not perceive them in the absence of
the cheese . . .</p>
<p>What then are these qualities of which we are so sure? They would not exist
without our brains; they would not exist without the cheese. They are the
results of the union, that is of the Yoga, of the seer and seen, of subject and
object ...</p>
<p>There is nothing here with which a modern physicist could quarrel; and this
is the magical theory of the universe. The magician assumes that <i>sensed
reality—</i>the panorama of impressions monitored by the senses and collated
by the brain—is radically different from so-called objective reality. <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

the anthology <i>Perception, </i>edited by Robert Blake, Ph.D., and especially
the chapter by psychologist Carl Rogers, which demonstrates that people's
perceptions change while they are in psychotherapy. As William Blake noted,
&quot;The fool sees not the same tree that the wise man sees.&quot;</span></p>
<p>theory and logic, or between theory and sense-data, are not discovered for
centuries (for example, the wandering of Mercury away from the Newtonian
calculation of its orbit). And even when achieved, lack of contradiction is
proof only that the theory <i>is not totally false. </i>It is never, in any
ease, proof that the theory <i>is totally true—</i>for an indefinite number of
such theories can be constructed from the known data at any time. For instance,
the geometries of Euclid, of Gauss and Reimann, of Lobachevski, and of Fuller <i>all
</i>work well enough on the surface of the earth, and it not yet clear whether
the Gauss-Reimann or the Fuller system works better in interstellar space.</p>
<p>If we have this much freedom in choosing our theories about &quot;objective
reality,&quot; we have even more liberty in deciphering the &quot;given&quot; or
transactional <i>sensed reality. </i>The ordinary person senses as he or she has
been taught to sense —that is, as they have been programmed by their society.
The magician is a self-programmer. Using invocation and evocation—which are
functionally identical with self-conditioning, auto-suggestion, and hypnosis, as
shown above—he or she edits or orchestrates sensed reality like an artist.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* Everybody, of course, does this
unconsciously; see the paragraph about the cheese. The magician, doing it
consciously, controls it</span></p>
<p>This book, being part of the only serious conspiracy it describes—that is,
part of Operation Mindfuck—has programmed the reader in ways that he or she
will not understand for a period of months (or perhaps years). When that
understanding is achieved, the real import of this appendix (and of the equation
5 = 6) will be clearer. Officials at Harvard thought Dr. Timothy Leary was
joking when he warned that students should not be allowed to indiscriminately
remove dangerous, habit-forming books from the library unless each student
proves a definite need for each volume. (For instance, you have lost track of
Joe-Malik's mysterious dogs by now.) It is strange that one can make the
clearest possible statements and yet be understood by many to have said the
opposite.</p>
<p>The Rite of Shiva, as performed by Joe Malik during the SSS Black Mass,
contains the central secret of all magick, very explicitly, yet most people can
reread that section a dozen, or a hundred times, and never understand what the
secret is. For instance, Miss Portinari was a typical Catholic girl in every
way—except for an unusual tendency to take Catholicism seriously—until she
began menstruating and performing spiritual meditations every day.* One morning,
during her meditation period, she visualized the Sacred Heart of Jesus with
unusual clarity; immediately another image, distinctly shocking to her, came to
mind with equal vividness. She recounted this experience to her confessor the
next Saturday, and he warned her, gravely, that meditation was not healthy for a
young girl, unless she intended to take the oath of seclusion and enter a
convent. She had no intention of doing that, but rebelliously (and guiltily)
continued her meditations anyway. The disturbing second image persisted whenever
she thought of the Sacred Heart; she began to suspect that this was sent by the
Devil to distract her from meditation.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* These two signs of growth often appear at
the same time, being DNA-triggered openings of the fourth neural circuit.</span></p>
<p>One weekend, when she was home from convent school on vacation, her parents
decided she was the right age to be introduced to Roman society. (Actually,
they, like most well-off Italian families, had already chosen which daughter
would be given to the church—and it wasn't her. Hence, this early introduction
to <i>la dolce vita.) </i>One of the outstanding ornaments of Rome at that time
was the &quot;eccentric international businessman&quot; Mr. Hagbard Celine, and
he was at the party to which Miss Portinari was taken that evening.</p>
<p>It was around eleven, and she had consumed perhaps a little too much Piper
Heidseck, when she happened to find herself standing near a small group who were
listening rapt-ly to a story the strange Celine was telling. Miss Portinari
wondered what this creature might be saying—he was reputedly even more cynical
and materialistic than other international money-grubbers, and Miss Portinari
was, at that time, the kind of conservative Catholic idealist who finds
capitalists even more dreadful than socialists. She idly tuned in on his words;
he was talking English, but she understood that language adequately.</p>
<p>&quot; 'Son, son,'&quot; Hagbbard recited, &quot; 'with two beautiful women
throwing themselves at you, why are you sitting alone in your room jacking off?'
&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Portinari blushed furiously and drank some more champagne to conceal it.
She hated the man already, knowing that she would surrender her virginity to him
at the earliest opportunity; of such complexities are intellectual Catholic
adolescents capable.</p>
<p>&quot;And the boy replied,&quot; Hagbard went on, &quot; 'I guess you just
answered your own question, Ma.' &quot;</p>
<p>There was a shocked silence.</p>
<p>&quot;The case is quite typical,&quot; Hagbard added blandly, obviously
finished. &quot;Professor Freud recounts even more startling family
dramas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see ...&quot; a celebrated French auto racer began, frowning.
Then he smiled. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;was the boy an American?&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Portinari left the group perhaps a bit too hurriedly (she felt a few
eyes following her) and quickly refilled her champagne glass.</p>
<p>A half-hour later she was standing on the veranda, trying to clear her head
in the night air, when a shadow moved near her and Celine appeared amid a cloud
of cigar smoke.</p>
<p>&quot;The moon has a fat jaw tonight,&quot; he said in Italian. &quot;Looks
like somebody punched her in the mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you a poet in addition to your other accomplishments?&quot; she
asked coolly. &quot;That sounds as if it might be American verse.&quot;</p>
<p>He laughed—a clear peal, like a stallion whinnying. &quot;Quite so,&quot;
he said. &quot;I just came from Rapallo, where I was talking to America's major
poet of this century. How old are you?&quot; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost sixteen,&quot; she said fumbling the words.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost fifteen,&quot; he corrected ungallantly.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's any affair of yours—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It might be,&quot; he replied easily. &quot;I need a girl your age for
something I have in mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can imagine. Something foul.&quot;</p>
<p>He stepped further out of the shadows and closer. &quot;Child,&quot; he said,
&quot;are you religious?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose you regard that as old-fashioned,&quot; she replied,
imagining his mouth on her breast and thinking of paintings of Mary nursing the
Infant.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point in history,&quot; he said simply, &quot;it's the only
thing that isn't old-fashioned. What was your birthdate? Never mind—you must
be a Virgo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am,&quot; she said. (His teeth would bite her nipple, but very
gently. He would know enough to do that.) &quot;But that is superstition, not
religion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could draw a precise line between religion, superstition, and
science.&quot; He smiled. &quot;I find that they keep running together. You are
Catholic, of course?&quot; His persistence was maddening.</p>
<p>&quot;I am too proud to believe an absurdity, and therefore I am not a
Protestant,&quot; she replied—immediately fearing that he would recognize the
plagiarism.</p>
<p>&quot;What symbol means the most to you?&quot; he asked, with the blandness
of a prosecuting attorney setting a trap.</p>
<p>&quot;The cross,&quot; she said quickly. She didn't want him to know the
truth.</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; He again corrected her ungallantly. &quot;The Sacred
Heart.&quot;</p>
<p>Then she knew he was of Satan's party.</p>
<p>&quot;I must go,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Meditate further on the Sacred Heart,&quot; he said, his eyes blazing
like a hypnotist's (a cornball gimmick, he was thinking privately, but it might
work). &quot;Meditate on it deeply, child. You will find in it the essential of
Catholicism —and the essential of all other religion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think you are mad,&quot; she responded, leaving the veranda with
undignified haste.</p>
<p>But two weeks later, during her morning meditation, she suddenly understood
the Sacred Heart. At lunchtime she disappeared—leaving behind a note to the
Mother Superior of the convent school and another note for her parents— and
went in search of Hagbard. She had even more potential than he realized, and (as
elsewhere recorded) within two years he abdicated in her favor. They never
became lovers.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">*They were quite good friends, though, and he
did fuck her occasionally.</span></p>
<p>The importance of symbols—images—as the link between word and primordial
energy demonstrates the unity between magick and yoga. Both magick and yoga—we
reiterate—are methods of self-programming employing synchronistically
connected chains of word, image, and bio-energy.</p>
<p>Thus, rationalists, who are all puritans, have never considered the fact that
disbelief in magick is found only in puritanical societies. The reason for this
is simple: Puritans are incapable of guessing what magick is essentially all
about. It can even be surely ventured that only those who have experienced true
love, in the classic Albigensian or troubadour sense of that expression, are
equipped to understand even the most clear-cut exposition of the mysteries.*</p>
<p>The eye in the triangle; for instance, is not primarily a symbol of the
Christian Trinity, as the gullible assume—except insofar as the Christian
Trinity is itself a visual (or verbal) elaboration on a much older meaning. Nor
is this symbol representative of the Eye of Osiris or even of the Eye of Horus,
as some have ventured; it is venerated, for instance, among the Cao Dai sect in
Vietnam, who never heard of Osiris or Horus. The eye's meaning can be found
quite simply by meditating on Tarot Trump XV, the Devil, which corresponds, on
the Tree of Life, to the Hebrew letter <i>ayin, </i>the eye. The reader who
realizes that &quot;The Devil&quot; is only a late rendering of the Great God
Pan has already solved the mystery of the eye, and the triangle has its usual
meaning. The two together are the union of <i>Yod, </i>the father, with <i>He, </i>the
Mother, as in <i>Yod-He-Vau-He, </i>the holy unspeakable name of God. <i>Vau, </i>the
Holy Ghost, is the result of their union, and final <i>He </i>is the divine
ecstasy which follows. One might even venture that one who contemplates this key
to the identities of Pan, the Devil, the Great Father, and the Great Mother will
eventually come to a new, more complete understanding of the Christian Trinity
itself, and especially of its most mysterious member, <i>Vau, </i>the elusive
Holy Ghost.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* This book has stated it as clearly as
possible in a number of places, but some readers are still wondering what we are
holding back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* This being has more in common with the
ordinary nocturnal visitor, sometimes called a &quot;ghost,&quot; than is
immediately evident to the uninitiated. Cf. the well-documented association of

<p>The pentagram comes in two forms but always represents the fullest extension
of the human psyche—the male human psyche in particular. The pentagram with
one horn exalted is, quite naturally, associated with the right-hand path; and
the two-horned pentagram with the left-hand path. (The Knights Templar, very
appropriately, inscribed the head of Baphomet, the goat-headed deity who was
their equivalent of Pan or the Devil, within the left-handed pentagram in</p>

<p>such wise that each &quot;horn&quot; contained one of Baphomet's horns.) It
is to be observed that the traditionally sinister* left-hand pentagram contains
an internal <i>pentagon </i>with one point <i>upward, </i>whereas the right-hand
pentagram contains an internal <i>pentagon </i>with one point <i>downward; </i>this
nicely illustrates the Law of Opposites. <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

for evocations, and mat is the only important difference. (It is assumed that

<p>pentagram, without prejudice, is that this form of the sacrament is always
destructive of the Holy Spirit, in a certain sense. It should be remembered that
the right-hand pentagram method is also destructive in most cases, especially by
those practitioners so roundly condemned in Chapter 14 of Joyce's <i>Ulysses—</i>and
this group is certainly the majority these days. In view of the ecological
crisis, it might even be wise to encourage the left-hand method and discourage
the right-hand method at this time, to balance the Sacred Numbers.</p>
<p>Very few readers of the <i>Golden Bough </i>have pierced Sir Prof. Dr.
Frazer's veil of euphemism and surmised the exact method used by Isis in
restoring life to Osiris, although this is shown quite clearly in extant
Egyptian frescoes. Those who are acquainted with this simple technique of
resurrecting the dead (which is <i>at least partially </i>successful in <i>all </i>cases
and totally successful in most) will have no trouble in skrying the esoteric
connotations of the Sacred Chao—or of the Taoist yin-yang or the astrological
sign of cancer. The method almost completely reverses that of the pentagrams,
right or left, and it can even be said that in a certain sense it was not Osiris
himself but his brother, Set, symbolically understood, who was the object of
Isis's magical workings. <i>In every case, without exception, a magical or
mystical symbol always refers to one of the very few* variations of the same,
very special variety of human sacrifice: the &quot;one eye opening&quot; or the
&quot;one hand clapping&quot;; and this sacrifice cannot be partial—it must
culminate in death if it is to be efficacious. </i>The literal-mindedness of the
Saures, in the novel, caused them to become a menace to life on earth; the
reader should bear this in mind. The sacrifice is not simple. It is a species of
cowardice, epidemic in Anglo-Saxon nations for more than three centuries, which
causes most who seek success in this field to stop short before the death of the
victim. <i>Anything less than death—that is, complete oblivion—simply will
not work.** </i>(One will find more clarity on this crucial point in the poetry
of John Donne than in most treatises alleging to explain the secrets of magick.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* Fewer than seventy, according to a classical
enumeration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">** The magician must always identify fully
with the victim, and share every agonized contortion to the utmost. Any attitude
of standing aside and watching, as in a theatrical performance, or any
intellectualization during the moments when the sword is doing its brutal but
necessary work, or any squeamishness or guilt or revulsion, creates the
two-mindedness against which Hagbard so vehemently warns in <i>Never Whistle
While You're Pissing. </i>In a sense, only the mind dies.</span></p>

HEXAGRAM.</p>
<p>The symbolism of the swastika is quite adequately explained in Wilhelm
Reich's <i>Mass Psychology of Fascism.</i></p>
<p>Ouroboros, the serpent eating its own tail, is chiefly emblematic of the Mass
of the Holy Ghost.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* See Israel Regardie, <i>The Tree of Life.</i></span></p>
<p>The Roman Catholic symbolism of the Sacred Heart is strikingly overt,
especially to readers of Frazer and Payne-Knight. In essence, it is the same
notion conveyed by the cartoonist's conventional rendering of Cupid shooting his
arrow into a red pulsating heart. This is the basic meaning of the Dying God and
the Resurrection. The identification of Christ with the pelican who stabs its
own heart with its beak (to feed its young) is an analogous rendering of the
same motif. We repeat that it was only because the Saure family so misread these
simple symbols that they became cruel and sadistic.</p>
<p>In essence, then, the basic symbols, of magic, mythology, and
religion—whether Eastern or Western, ancient or modern, &quot;right-hand&quot;
or &quot;left-hand&quot;—are so simple that only the pernicious habit of
looking for alleged &quot;profundities&quot; and &quot;mysteries&quot; prevents
people from automatically understanding them almost without thinking. The
meaning of the hexagram—the female equivalent of the male pentagram</p>
<p>—was explicated by Freud himself, but most students, convinced that the
answer could not be so elementary and down-to-earth, continue to look into the
clouds.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to written symbols. The all-important name YOD HE
