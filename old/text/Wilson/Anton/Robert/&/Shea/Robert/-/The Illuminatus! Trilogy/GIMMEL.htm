<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">THE ILLUMINATI THEORY OF HISTORY</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to this day, the proverb is still repeated from the Danube to the Rhine:
&quot;It is dangerous to talk too much about the Illuminati.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">—VON JUNTZ, <i>Unausprechlichen Kulten</i></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Theoretically, an Age of Bureaucracy can last until a paper shortage
develops, but, in practice, it never lasts longer than 73 permutations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">—WEISHAUPT, <i>Konigen, Kirchen and Dummheit</i></span></p>
<p>In a well-known passage in the <i>Necronomicon </i>Abdul Alhazred writes,
&quot;They ruled once where man rules now; where man rules now, they shall rule
again. After summer is winter, and after winter, summer.&quot; Weishaupt, who
possessed only the Olaus Wormius translation, in the 1472 Lyons edition with its
numerous misprints and errors, found this text scrambled into &quot;They ruled
once where man rules now, summer. Where man rules now, after summer is winter.
They shall rule again, and after winter.&quot; Thoroughly confused, he wrote to
his good friend the Kabalist Kolmer in Baghdad for an explanation. Kolmer,
meanwhile, dispatched a letter to him answering a previous question. When this
epistle arrived, Weishaupt had been experimenting with a new strain of Alamout
black and was in no condition to realize it was a reply to an earlier query; he
was, thus, ready to accept enlightenment in the words: &quot;Concerning your
rather thorny enquiry: I find that, in most cases, ergot is the best remedy.
Failing this, I can only suggest the path of Don Juan.&quot;</p>
<p>Weishaupt assumed that Kolmer meant the passage would become clear if he read
it while under the influence of ergot. He promptly went down to his laboratory
and tossed off a jigger; then, for good measure, he chewed a few peyote buttons.
(He was under the misapprehension that the Don Juan referred to was the same
Yaqui Indian magician of the twentieth century whose mind he had been tapping
through the <i>Morgenheutegesternwelt. </i>Peyote was that Don Juan's great
&quot;teacher,&quot; and Weishaupt had imported some from Mexico at great
trouble and expense.) It should be explained at this point that the question
which Kolmer was answering happened to be not philosophical but personal.
Weishaupt had sought his advice on a problem much perplexing him that month: the
fact that his sister-in-law was somewhat pregnant and circumstantial evidence
seemed to mark him as the father. He wasn't at all sure how to explain this to
Eve. Kolmer had intended to convey that Adam should give his paramour the ergot,
since it often functions as an abortifacient; the alternative referred to the
path of an earlier Don Juan and meant splitting the scene entirely. However, the
stoned Ingolstadt sage misunderstood totally, and so came to the <i>Necronomicon
</i>full of hashish, peyote, and a substantial quality of ergot, which had,
under the influence of the other drugs and his own intestinal juices, mutated
into ergotine, a close chemical cousin of LSD. The result was that the words
seemed to leap out of the page at him, shouting with intense meaning:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">THEY RULED ONCE WHERE MAN RULES NOW SUMMER
WHERE MAN RULES NOW AFTER SUMMER IS WINTER THEY SHALL RULE AGAIN AND AFTER
WINTER</span></p>
<p>Abdul Alhazred's concept of the Great Cycle, which derived actually from the <i>Upanishads,
</i>took on kinky edges in Weishaupt's flipped-out cortex. <i>Five </i>kinky
edges, to be exact, since he was still obsessed with the profound new
understanding of the Law of Fives he had achieved the night he saw the shoggoth
turn into a rabbit. He quickly fetched Giambattista Vico's <i>Scienze nuovo </i>from
his shelf and began reading: He saw that he was right. Vico's theory of history,
in which all societies pass through the same four stages, was an
oversimplification—there were, when you looked closely at the actual evidence
behind Vico's rhetoric, <i>five </i>distinct stages each time the Italian listed
only four. Weishaupt looked very closely, and, like Joe Malik, the harder be
looked the more fives he found.</p>
<p>It was then that the man's truly unique mind made its great leap: He
remembered that Joachim of Floris, a proto-primus Illuminatus of the eleventh
century, had divided history into three stages: the Age of the Father, dominated
by Law; the Age of the Son, dominated by Love; and the Age of the Holy Spirit,
dominated by Joy. Where most philosophers rush to publish their insights,
Weishaupt saw the advantage of an alternative path. The Law of Fives would be
kept secret, so that only Illuminati Primi would know about it and could predict
events correctly, but the Joachimite theory would be revived and publicized to
mislead others. (He, Kolmer, Meyer Amschel Rothschild, DeSade, and Sir Frances
Dashwood—the original Five—had some discussions about possibly pushing Vico
instead of Joachim, but, as Weishaupt argued, &quot;Four is a <i>little bit </i>too
close to five . . .&quot; Even so, it was quite a spell of years before they
found the ideal front man to push the three-step theory, G. W. F. Hegel.
&quot;He's perfect,&quot; Weishaupt wrote in the De Molay cipher from Mount
Vernon. &quot;Unlike Kant, who makes sense only in German, this man doesn't make
sense in any language.&quot;) The rest of the story—the exoteric story, at
least —is history. After Hegel was Marx; and after Marx, the Joachimite
three-step was permanently grafted onto revolutionary tactics.</p>
<p>The esoteric story, of course, is different. For instance, in 1914, when the
fifth and final stage of Western Civilization was dawning, James Joyce published
<i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. </i>The five chapters of that novel
not only suggested five stages in the hero's growth, but by the alteration of
styles from chapter to chapter suggested analogies with other five-stage
processes. This was too much for the Illuminati Primi of the time, who warned
Joyce to be more careful in the future. A battle of wills ensued, and all
through the writing of <i>Ulysses </i>Joyce was still considering a novel built
entirely around the Law of Fives. When the Illuminati gave him what they call
&quot;the Tiresias treatment&quot; —blindness—he finally compromised. <i>Finnegans
Wake, </i>when it appeared, broke with the Joachim-Hegel-Marx three-step but did
not include the <i>funfwissenschaft. </i>Instead, the Viconian four-stage theory
was resurrected, a middle path that appealed to Joyce's sense of synchroniciry,
since he had once taught at a school on Vico Road in Dublin and later also lived
in a house on Via Giambattista Vico in Rome.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* Do you believe that?</span></p>
<p>Now for a few words about the &quot;real truth,&quot; at least as the
Illuminati understand &quot;real truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Every society actually passes through the five stages of <i>Verwirrung, </i>or
chaos; <i>Zweitracht, </i>or discord; <i>Unordnung, </i>or confusion; <i>Beamtenherrschaft,
</i>or bureaucracy; and <i>Grummet, </i>or aftermath. Sometimes, to make
comparison with the exoteric Hegel-Marx system more pointed, the esoteric
Illuminati system is defined as: Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis, Parenthesis, and
Paralysis. The public Hegel-Marx triad is also called the tricycle, and the
arcane latter two stages are called the bicycle; one of the first secrets
revealed to every illuminatus Minore is &quot;After the tricycle it comes always
the bicycle.&quot; (The Uluminati are rather prone toward literal translations
from Weishaupt's German.)</p>
<p>The first stage, <i>Verwirrung </i>or chaos, is the point from which all
societies begin and to which they all return. It is, so to speak, the natural
condition of humanity—an estimation which the reader can confirm by closely
observing his neighbors (or, if he has the necessary objectivity, himself).</p>
<p>It is, therefore, also the fundamental Thesis. The Illuminati associate this
with Eris, and also with other goddesses from Isis to Ishtar and from Kwannon to
Kali—with the Female Principle, yin, in general. This correlates with hexagram
2 in the <i>I Ching: </i>that is, <i>K'un, </i>which has the meanings of
receptivity, nature (in contrast to spirit), earth (in contrast to sky), female
(in contrast to male). Thus, although this is the first stage chronologically,
it has the mystical number 2, which is always associated with the female in
magic; and it correlates with the 2nd trump in Tarot, the High Priestess, who
represents not only maternity and fertility but gnosis. The sign of the horns
represents <i>Verwirrung </i>because the fingers make a V shape; and the planet
or the symbol of Venus, <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1032"

also designates this stage. On the Zodiac: Aquarius, <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1033"

<p>The second stage, <i>Zweitracht, </i>begins with the appearance of a ruling
or governing class. This is the Antithesis of chaos, of course, and leads
directly into discord when the servile class discovers that its interests are
not the same as the interests of the ruling class. This correlates with Osiris,
Jehovah, and all masculine deities; with the symbol of the All-Seeing Eye; with
hexagram 1 in the <i>I Ching: Ch'ien, </i>the creative, the heavenly, the
strong, the powerful; with the male principle, yang, in general; with the number
3, symbolizing the all-male Christian trinity; with the 12th trump of the Tarot,
the Hanged Man,&nbsp; symbolizing sacrifice, schism and schizophrenia; and with
the planet or symbol of Mars, <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

Naturally, a <i>Zweitracht </i>period is always replete with &quot;internal
contradictions,&quot; and somebody like Karl Marx always arises to point them
out. On the Zodiac: Pisces, <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1035" type="#_x0000_t75" alt="illum-part2-67.jpg"

<p>The third stage, <i>Unordnung </i>or confusion, occurs when an attempt is
made to restore balance or arrive at the Hegelian Synthesis. This correlates
with Loki, the Devil, Mercury (god of thieves), Thoth in his role of Trickster,
Coyote, and other spirits of illusion or deception; with hexagram 4 in the <i>I</i>
<i>Ching, Meng, </i>youthful folly or standing on the brink of the abyss; with
the number 11, signifying sin, penance, and revelation; with the 21st trump in
the Tarot, the Fool who walks over the abyss; and with the planet or sign of
Mercury, <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1036" type="#_x0000_t75"

It represents that attempt to restore the state of nature by unnatural means, an
annihilation of the biogram by the logogram. On the Zodiac: Cancer,</p>

<p>The fourth stage, <i>Beamtenherrschaft </i>or bureaucracy, represents the
Parentheses that occur when the Hegelian Synthesis does not succeed in
reconciling the opposites. This correlates with Void (absence of any divinity);
with <i>I</i> <i>Ching </i>hexagram 47, <i>K'un, </i>oppression or exhaustion,
superior men held in restraint by inferior men; with the number 8, indicating
balance and the Last Judgment; with the 16th Tarot trump, Falling Tower,
representing deteriorations and the Tower of Babel; and with the planetoid or
sign of the moon, <span style="font-size:10.0pt"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

<p>The fifth stage, <i>Grummet </i>or aftermath, represents the transition back
to chaos. Bureaucracy chokes in its own paperwork; mind is at the end of its
tether; in desperation, many begin to deny the logogram and follow the biogram,
with varying degrees of success. This correlates with Hermaphrodite; with <i>I</i>

water; with the number 5, union of male and female; with the 6th trump of the
Tarot, the Lovers, indicating union; and with the sun or its symbol, <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

<p>Since the association of these references, and their bearings on history, may
be a bit unclear to some readers, we will give further details on each stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">VERWIRRUNG</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this chaotic period, the Hodge and the Podge are in dynamic balance. There
is no stasis: The balance is always shifting and homeostatic, in the manner of
the ideal &quot;self-organizing system&quot; of General Systems Theory or
Cybernetics. The Illuminati, and all authoritarian types in general, dislike
such ages so much that they try to prevent any records of their existence from
reaching the general public. Pre-Chou China was one such period, and its history
(except for some fragments in Taoist lore) is largely lost; we do know, however,
that the <i>I Ching </i>was reorganized when the Chou Dynasty introduced
patriarchal authoritarianism to China. It was then that the hexagram <i>K'un,</i>
<!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1042" type="#_x0000_t75"
 alt="illum-part2-74.jpg" style='width:23.25pt;height:18pt'>

  o:href="../illuminatus/the%20Il76.jpg"/>
</v:shape><![endif]-->
<img src="1.htm44.jpg" alt="illum-part2-74.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1042" width="31" height="24">,
associated with this period was moved from the first place to its present,
second place in the <i>Ching. </i>Every line in <i>K'un </i>is broken (yin),
because this is a feminist and prepatriarchal form of society, and because yin
correlates with the agricultural rather than the urban. Always linked to
darkness by mystics, this <i>K'un </i>style of sensibility is also linked, by
the Illuminati, with <i>dreck </i>(dung) and everything they find messy and
intolerable about ordinary human beings. (The Erisians, of course, take the
opposite position, connect this with Eris, the primordial goddess, and regard it
as ideal.)</p>
<p><i>Verwirrung </i>is numerologically linked with 2, not only because of <i>K'un's
</i>shift from first to second place in the <i>Ching, </i>but because it is the
balance of Hodge and Podge. Thus, even though it is the first stage
chronologically, it is never linked with 1 in magic sense, because 1 signifies
the erect penis, the male principle in isolation, and such authoritarian games
as monotheism, monopoly, monogamy, and general monotony. This dynamic 2-ness of <i>Verwirrung
</i>is also implicit in its Tarot card, the 2nd trump or High Priestess, who
sits between a black pillar and a white one (cf. The Hodge and Podge) and who
represents mystery, magic, mischief, and Erisian values generally. She wears the
balanced (solar) cross, rather than the unbalanced (Christian) cross, to
emphasize the unity of opposites in such a historical period.</p>
<p>Typical Aquarians who have manifested <i>Verwirrung </i>values are Aaron
Burr, Christopher Marlowe, Hung Mung, Charles Darwin, Willard Gibbs (who
incorporated chaos into mathematics), Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Elizabeth Blackwell
(pioneer woman physician), Anna Pavlova, Mozart, Lewis Carrol, Robert Burns,
James Joyce, Lord Byron, David Wark Griffith, and Gelett Burgess, author of the
classic Erisian poem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never saw a purple cow I never hope to see one But I'll tell you this
anyhow: I'd rather see than be one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <i>Verwirrung </i>phase of European history is identified with the
Danubian Culture, so called because most of its relics have been found along the
shores of the Danube. According to archeologists, the Danubian culture was
agricultural, pre-urban, worshipped a female rather than a male god, and never
invented anything remotely like a state. The pre-Inca society of Peru, the
Minoan civilization, the pre-Chou period of China already mentioned, and many
American Indian tribes still surviving also represent a <i>Verwir-rung </i>social
framework. The synthesis of Hodge and Podge, and especially of biogram and
logogram, in such cultures is indicated by the amazement of explorers from
authoritarian societies when first encountering them. The usual words about the
&quot;grace&quot; and &quot;spontaniety&quot; of the natives merely represent
the lack of authoritarian conflict between biogram and logogram: These people
sit, like the Tarot High Priestess, between opposite poles, without tilting one
way or the other.</p>
<p>But the fact that this is a <i>dynamic </i>and not a <i>static </i>balance
means that eventually (after 73 permutations, according to Weishaupt) the second
stage must evolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.5pt">ZWEITRACHT</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this discordant period, the Hodge and the Podge are in conflict, because a
ruling class emerges which attempts to control the others. This correlates with
hexagram 1, <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1043" type="#_x0000_t75"
 alt="illum-part2-75.jpg" style='width:26.25pt;height:21pt'>

<img src="1.htm45.jpg" alt="illum-part2-75.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1043" width="35" height="28">,
<i>Ch'ien, </i>the all-powerful, in the <i>I</i> <i>Ching. </i>The six unbroken
lines represent the severity and monotony of such a period, which is, above all,
the age of the T-square, the building of fences, the division of lands by
&quot;boundaries&quot; drawn on maps, and the imposition of one man's (or one
group's) will upon all others. Typically, the earth is regarded as both flat and
finite by the <i>Zweitracht </i>mentality, and there is much concern with
dividing it up into portions (among themselves, of course). The
&quot;superstitious&quot; terror of American Indians when first confronting maps
was merely the reaction of a <i>Verwirrung </i>mentality to a <i>Zweitracht </i>mentality:
The Indians could not conceive of people treating earth as a thing to be
exploited rather than a mother to be respected.</p>
<p><i>Zweitracht </i>associates with 3 numerologically because 3 is the totally
male number, because all-male Trinities (Brahma-Vishnu-Siva, Father-Son-Spirit,
etc.) are invented in such ages, and because the discord always has a minimum of
3 vectors, not merely 2. That is, the division into a propertied ruling class
and an unpropertied governed class</p>
<p>immediately sets in motion further cupidity; the ruling class soon falls to
fighting over the spoils. Contrary to Marx, most of the strife in <i>Zweitracht </i>ages
is not the conflict between proprietors and proles but between various
proprietors over who gets the biggest share of the pie.</p>
<p>The governing Tarot card is trump 12, the Hanged Man. The cross on which he
hangs is blossoming, to show that it is still organic and alive (the biogram);
he hangs upside down, to show the reversal of nature. He represents both the
burden of omniscience in the owning-governing class and the burden of nescience
in the servile-submissive class: the total crucifixion of desire by <i>Realprinzip
</i>and <i>Realpolitik.</i></p>
<p>The astrological sign of this period is Pisces, the two fish swimming in
opposite directions indicating the conflict of logogram and biogram
(&quot;body&quot; and &quot;spirit,&quot; astrologers say.) Typical Pisceans who
have shown the <i>Zweitracht </i>personality are E. H. Harriman, the railroad
magnate (who covered the United States with <i>Ch'ien</i>-style unbroken
straight lines), Cardinal John Henry Newman, Sir Robert Baden-Powell, founder of
the Boy Scouts (an attempt to instill Piscean authoritarianism even in
childhood), Admiral Chester Nimitz, John Foster Dulles, Anna Lee (founder of the
world's most antisexual religion, the Shakers), industrialists like Kruger and
Pullman, financiers like Cambell and Braden, Grover Cleveland, John C. Calhoun,
Neville Chamberlain, Andrew Jackson (whose expulsion of the Cherokee Nation from
its traditional lands onto the &quot;trail of tears,&quot; where most of them
perished, is the archetypal <i>Zweitracht </i>land-grab), William Jennings
Bryan, and Frank Stanton of CBS.</p>
<p>Since all Illuminati with any academic leanings at all are encouraged to
major in history, the tendency in most textbooks is not only to black out <i>Verwirrung
</i>periods but to glorify <i>Zweitracht </i>periods as ages of Light and
Progress. Indeed, they make entertaining reading: They .are ages of expansion,
and there are always new people being discovered to be subjugated,
&quot;civilized,&quot; and converted to tax-payers and rent-payers. Almost any
age described in glowing and admiring language in a history text will prove, on
examination, to be a <i>Zweitracht </i>era, and the foremost butchers and
invaders are treated as the outstanding heroes of humanity. A sympathetic
reading of the biographies of these empire-builders almost always indicates that
they were <i>homo neophile </i>individuals who turned their talents to
destruction rather than creativity because of bitterness engendered by years of
torment and baiting by <i>homo neo-phobe </i>types during their childhoods.</p>
<p>The ever-present conflict in a <i>Zweitracht </i>period eventually leads to
the third stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:18.0pt">UNORDNUNG</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humanity has been transformed during a <i>Zweitracht </i>age, by placing
logogram in governing authority over bio-gram. <i>Unordnung </i>is an attempt to
restore balance by revolutionizing the logogram; there is no thought about the
biogram, because contact with this somatic component of personality has been
lost. (This loss of contact has been variously described by pre-Celinean
observers: It is &quot;the veil of Maya&quot; in Buddhism, the &quot;censor
band&quot; or &quot;repression&quot; in psychoanalysis, the &quot;character
armoring&quot; and &quot;muscular armoring&quot; in Reichian psychology, etc.)</p>
<p>The <i>I</i> <i>Ching </i>hexagram for this stage is Meng, <span style="font-size:10.0pt"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1044" type="#_x0000_t75"

or Youthful Folly. The yang line at the top indicates the continued supremacy of
logogram, even though some biogram elements (the yin lines) begin to reassert
themselves. The traditional reading is &quot;mountain above water&quot;; that
is, the rigid logogram still repressing the Aquarian element as it seeks to
liberate itself. The usual Chinese interpretation of this hexagram is &quot;The
young fool needs discipline,&quot; and the leaders of all rebellions at this
stage always heartily agree with that and demand unquestioning obedience from
their followers. This is a time of turmoils, troubles, and tyrannies that appear
and disappear rapidly.</p>
<p>The mystical number is 11, which means &quot;a new start&quot; in Kabalism
and &quot;error and repentence&quot; in most other systems of numerology.</p>
<p>Tarot trump 21, The Fool, symbolizes this age as a dreamy-eyed youth
unknowingly walking over an abyss. The <i>Hitlerjugend, </i>and the disciples of
various other <i>fuehrers </i>and messiahs, immediately come to mind. That this
card is disputed by various Tarot experts, and is given a numerical value of 0
rather than 21 by the wisest, indicates the confusion in all <i>Unordnung </i>periods.
The dog who barks to warn the Young Fool, like the yin lines in the hexagram,
represents the desperate attempts of the biogram ton break through the
repression or censor-band and make itself heard.</p>
<p>Typical Cancerians who exemplified <i>Unordnung </i>are Julius Caesar, Mary
Baker Eddy (whose philosophy was an explicit denial of the biogram), Albert
Parsons, Emma Goldman, Benjamin Peret, Vladimir Mayakofski, Henry David Thoreau,
Durrutti, P-J Proudhon, Brooks Adams, General Kitchener, Luigi Pirandello (the
literary master of ambiguity), Erich Ambler (the literary master of conspiracy),
Calvin Coolidge (who issued the classically muddled Cancerian statement &quot;Be
as revolutionary as science and as conservative as the multiplication
table&quot;), Andrei Gromy-ko, Nelson Rockefeller, John Calvin, Estes Kefauver,
and Rexford Tugwell.</p>
<p>An <i>Unordnung </i>period has always been thought of (even before Hegel
provided the words) as a synthesis between the thesis of <i>Verwirrung </i>and
the antithesis <i>Zweitracht; since </i>it is a false synthesis on the
logogrammic level only, it always gives birth to the fourth stage, the
Parenthesis.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18.0pt">BEAMTENHERRSCHAFT</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the age of bureaucracy, and to live at this time is, as Proudhon
said, &quot;to have every operation, every transaction, every movement noted,
registered, counted, rated, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed,
refused, authorized, endorsed, admonished, prevented, reformed, redressed,
corrected ... to be laid under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited,
monopolized, extorted from, exhausted, hoaxed, and robbed.&quot; The governing <i>I
Ching </i>hexagram is 47, <i>K'un, <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1045"

</i>oppression or exhaustion, the dried-up lake, with the usual reading of
superior men oppressed by the inferior. This is the time when <i>homo neo-phobe </i>types
most rigorously repress <i>homo neophile </i>types, and great heresy hunts and
witch trials flourish. This correlates with the number 8, signifying the Last
Judgment, because every citizen is to some extent a State functionary, and each
is on trial before the jury of all. The traditional Chinese associations with
this hexagram are sitting under a bare tree and wandering through an empty
valley—signifying the ecological havoc wreaked by purely abstract minds
working upon the organic web of nature.</p>
<p>The 16th Tarot trump, The Tower, describes this age.</p>
<p>The Tower is struck by lightning and the inhabitants fall from the windows.
(Cf. the Tower of Babel legend and our recent power failures.) The traditional
interpretations of this card suggest pride, oppression, and bankruptcy.</p>
<p>This correlates with Libra, the mentality which measures and balances all
things on an artificial scale (Maya). Typical Libras who have manifested <i>Beamtenherrschaft
</i>charac-terists are Comte de Saint Simon, Justice John Marshall, Hans Geiger,
Henry Wallace, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kenneth Galbraith, Arthur Schlesinger,
Jr., John Dewey, and Dr. Joyce Brothers.</p>
<p>In <i>Beamtenherrschaft </i>ages there is ceaseless activity, all planned in
advance, begun at the scheduled second, carefully supervised, scrupulously
recorded—but inevitably finished late and poorly done. The burden of
omniscience on the ruling class becomes virtually intolerable, and most flee
into some form of schizophrenia or fantasy. Great towers, pyramids, moon shots,
and similar marvels are accomplished at enormous cost while the underpinnings of
social solidarity crumble entirely. While blunders multiply, no responsible
individual can ever be found, because all decisions are made by committees;
anyone seeking redress of grievance wanders into endless corridors of paperwork
with no more tangible result than in the Hunting of the Snark. Illuminati
historians, of course, describe these ages as glowingly as <i>Zweitracht </i>epochs,
for, although control is in the hands of <i>homo neophobe </i>types, there is at
least a kind of regularity, order, and geometrical precision about everything,
and the &quot;messiness&quot; of the barbaric <i>Verwirrung </i>ages and
revolutionary <i>Unordnung </i>ages is absent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the burden of omniscience on the rulers steadily escalates, as
we have indicated, and the burden of nescience on the servile class increasingly
renders them unfit to serve (more and more are placed on the dole, shipped to
&quot;mental&quot; hospitals, or recruited into whatever is the current analog
of the gladiatorial games), so the Tower eventually falls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:18.0pt">GRUMMET</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The age of Grummet begins with an upsurge of magicians, hoaxers, Yippies,
Kabouters, shamans, clowns, and other Eristic forces. The relevant I Ching
hexagram is 59,</p>
<p><i>Huan, </i><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

</i>dispersion and dissolution. The gentle wind above the deep water is the
Chinese reading of the image, with associations of loss of ego, separation from
the group, and &quot;going out&quot; in general. Yin lines dominate all but the
top of the hexagram; the forces leading to a new <i>Verwir-rung </i>stage are
pushing upward toward release. This is also called Paralysis by the Illuminati,
because, objectively, nothing much is happening; subjectively, of course, the
preparations for the new cycle are working unconsciously.</p>
<p>The mystic number is 5, union of male (3) with female (2) and final
resolution of conflict between <i>Verwirrung </i>and <i>Zweitracht.</i></p>
<p>The governing Tarot trump is number 6, the Lovers, in which the woman looks
upward at the angel (Eris, the bio-gram) and the man looks at the woman (the
logogram, yang, reaches synthesis with biogram, yin, only through reconciliation
with the female). Hence, the upsurge of feminism in such periods, together with
a renewed emphasis on clans, tribes, and communes.</p>
<p>Typical Virgos manifesting <i>Grummet </i>traits are Charlie Parker, Antonin
Artaud, Louis Lingg, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Grandma Moses, Lodovico Ariosto,
Greta Garbo, Hedy Lamarr, and Goethe and Tolstoy (who manifested strong yin
values while never quite getting reconciled with the women in their own lives.
Tolstoy, however, as the classic dropout, is an archetypal Grummet persona and
almost completed the Sufi course of &quot;quit this world, quit the next world,
quit quitting!&quot;).</p>
<p>After <i>Grummet, of </i>course, authority has collapsed entirely, and the
biogram stands on equal footing with the logogram. Hodge and Podge being once
again in dynamic balance, a new <i>Verwirrung </i>period begins, and the cycle
repeats.</p>
<p>Since Weishaupt dreamed this schema up while he was under the influence of
several hallucinogenic drugs, one should regard it with some skepticism. It is
certainly not true in every detail, and there is no theoretical or empirical
demonstration that each of the five ages must always have 73 permutations. The
fact that <i>Grummet-Virgo </i>personalities (and all other of the five
personality types) are born in all ages, even if they come to dominance in their
appropriate epochs, leaves many mysteries still unsolved. In short, all that a
sober scholar can say of the Illuminati theory of</p>
<p>history is that it makes at least as much sense as the exoteric Marx-Hegel,
Spengler, Toynbee, and Sorokin theories.</p>

who regard all Illuminati theories as false projections onto the external world
of inner spiritual processes, are particularly skeptical about this one, since
it involves several false correlations between the <i>I</i> <i>Ching </i>and the
Tarot, the Zodiac, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that of all the people Hagbard employed as
resonance for the vibes used against the Saure family in Ingolstadt, only Lady
Velkor, Danny Pricefixer, and George Dorn were not Virgos. Hagbard evidently
believed that the Illuminati magical links work when Illuminati activities are
occurring in a given area—and, hence, virtually all of &quot;his&quot; people
at the festival were Virgos and thereby linked with the <i>Grummet/Huan-59</i>/Trump
6 chain of astrological associations. On the other hand, the presence of three
non-Virgos shows Hagbard's pragmatic approach and his refusal to be ruled even
by so exact a science as astrology.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* This sentence may manifest a lapse into
mockery or mystification by<b> </b>otherwise sober authors.</span></p>
<p>In this connection, when George Dorn and his mother went to Radio City Music
Hall to see <i>The Lotus Position, </i>the last movie made by the American
Medical Association before their tragic deaths, they happened to meet a tall
Italian and a very beautiful black woman whom he introduced as his wife. Mrs.
Dorn didn't catch the Italian's name, but it was obvious that George had a very
great admiration for him. On the bus back to Nutley, she decided to straighten
the boy out.</p>
<p>&quot;A man who respects himself and his own race,&quot; she began,
&quot;would never think of marrying into <i>the colored.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Shut up, Ma,&quot; George said politely.</p>
<p>&quot;That's no way to talk to your mother,&quot; the fine lady said, going
ahead blithely. &quot;Now, your father had some radical ideas, and he tried to
get the unions to accept <i>the colored, </i>but he never thought of marrying
into them, George. He had too much self-respect. Are you listening,
George?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you like the AMA?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Such wonderful young boys. So clean-cut. And that darling sister of
theirs! At least they didn't think there was anything attractive about long hair
on men. Do you know what long hair makes men look like?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like girls, Ma. Is that right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It makes them look worse than girls, George. It makes them look like
they're not really men, if you know what I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I don't know what you mean, Ma.&quot; George was profoundly bored.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I mean a <i>little </i>bit on the lavender side.&quot; She
tittered.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;you mean cocksuckers. Some of my best friends
are cocksuckers, Ma.&quot;</p>
<p>At this simple piece of factual information, the remarkable lady turned red
and then purple, and then twisted in her chair to look out the window in angry
silence for the rest of the trip. The curious thing is that, before George could
get the courage to shut the old battleaxe up that way, he first had to try to
shoot a cop and then try to shoot himself and finally take hashish with Hagbard
Celine, and yet she was a Virgo and he was a Capricorn.</p>
