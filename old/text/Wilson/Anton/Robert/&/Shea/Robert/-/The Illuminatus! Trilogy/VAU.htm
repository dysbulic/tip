<p><i><span style="font-size:18.0pt">FLAXSCR1P AND HEMPSCRIP</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flaxscrip was first introduced into Discordian groups by the mysterious
Malaclypse the Younger, K.S.C., in 1968. Hempscrip followed the year after,
issued by Dr. Mordecai Malignatus, K.N.S. (In the novel, taking one of our few
liberties with historical truth, we move these coinages backward in time and
attribute hempscrip to the Justified Ancients of Mummu.)</p>
<p>The <i>idea </i>behind flaxscrip, of course, is as old as history; there was
private money long before there was government money. The first revolutionary
(or reformist) use of this idea, as a check against galloping usury and high
interest rates, was the foundation of &quot;Banks of Piety&quot; by the
Dominican order of the Catholic Church in the late middle ages. (See Tawney, <i>Religion
and the Rise of Capitalism.) </i>The Dominicans, having discovered that
preaching against usury did not deter the usurer, founded their own banks and
provided loans without interest; this &quot;ethical competition&quot; (as Josiah
Warren later called it) drove the commercial banks out of the areas where the
Dominicans practiced it. Similar private currency, loaned at a low rate of
interest (but not at no interest), was provided by Scots banks until the British
government, acting on behalf of the monopoly of the Bank of England, stopped
this exercise of free enterprise. (See Muellen, <i>Free Banking.) </i>The same
idea was tried successfully in the American colonies before the Revolution, and
again was suppressed by the British government, which some heretical historians
regard as a more direct cause of the American Revolution than the taxes
mentioned in most schdolbooks. (See Ezra Pound, <i>Impact, </i>and additional
sources cited therein.)</p>

<p>___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel,
may be compared to the stance of the Bible Fundamentalist who avers that JHVH
made the universe in six days in 4004 B.C. but included fossils and other false
leads to make it appear much older. One could equally assert that the cosmos
appeared out of Void one second ago, including us and our false memories of a
longer duration here.</span></p>
<p>During the nineteenth century many anarchists and individualists attempted to
issue low-interest or no-interest private currencies. <i>Mutual Banking, </i>by
Colonel William Greene, and <i>True Civilization, </i>by Josiah Warren, are
records of two such attempts, by their instigators. Lysander Spooner, an
anarchist who was also a constitutional lawyer, argued at length that Congress
had no authority to suppress such private currencies (see his <i>Our Financiers:
Their Ignorance, Usurpations and Frauds). </i>A general overview of such efforts
at free enterprise, soon crushed by the Capitalist State, is given by James M.
Martin in his <i>Men Against the State, </i>and by Rudolph Rocker in <i>Pioneers
of American Freedom </i>(an ironic title, since his pioneers all lost their
major battles). Lawrence Labadie, of Suffern, N.Y., has collected (but not yet
published) records of 1,000 such experiments; one of the present authors, Robert
Anton Wilson, unearthed in 1962 the tale of a no-interest currency, privately
issued, in Yellow Springs, Ohio, during the 1930s depression. (This was an
emergency measure by certain local businessmen, who did not fully appreciate the
principle involved, and was abandoned as soon as the &quot;tight-money&quot;
squeeze ended and Roosevelt began flooding us all with Federal Reserve notes.)</p>
<p>It is traditional among liberal historians to dismiss such endeavors as
&quot;funny-money schemes.&quot; They have never explained why government money
is any less hilarious. (That used in the U.S. now, for instance, is actually
worth 47 percent of its &quot;declared&quot; face value). All money is funny, if
you stop to think about it, but no private currency, competing on a free market,
could ever be quite so comical (and tragic) as the notes now bearing the magic
imprint of Uncle Sam—and backed only by his promise (or threat) that, come
hell or high water, by God he'll make it good by taxing our descendants unto the
infinite generation to pay the interest on it The National Debt, so called, is
of course, nothing else but the debt we owe the bankers who &quot;loaned&quot;
this money to Uncle after he kindly gave them the credit which enabled them to
make this loan. Hempscrip or even acidscrip or peyotescrip could never be quite
so clownish as this system, which only the Illuminati (if they really exist)
could have dreamed up. The system has but one advantage: It makes bankers richer
every year. Nobody else, from the industrial capitalist or &quot;captain of
industry&quot; to the coal-miner, profits from it in any way, and all pay the
taxes, which become the interest payments, which make the bankers richer. If the
Illuminati did not exist, it would be necessary to invent them—such a system
can be explained in no other way, except by those cynics who hold that human
stupidity is infinite.</p>
<p>The idea behind hempscrip is more radical than the notion of
private-enterprise currency per se. Hempscrip, as employed in the novel,
depreciates; it is, thus, not merely a <i>no-interest </i>currency, but a <i>negative-interest
</i>currency. The lender literally pays the borrower to take it away for a
while. It was invented by German business-economist Silvio Gesell, and is
described in his <i>Natural Economic Order </i>and in professor Irving Fisher's <i>Stamp
Script.</i></p>
<p>Gresham's Law, like most of the &quot;laws&quot; taught in State-supported
public schools, is not quite true (at least, not in the form in which it is
usually taught). <i>&quot;Bad money drives out good&quot; holds only in
authoritarian societies, not in libertarian societies. </i>(Gresham was
clear-minded enough to state explicitly that he was only describing
authoritarian societies; <i>his </i>formulation of his own &quot;Law&quot;
begins with the words &quot;If the king issueth two moneys . . . ,&quot; thereby
implying that the State must exist if the &quot;Law&quot; is to operate.) <i>In
a libertarian society, good money will drive out the bad. </i>This Utopian
proposition—which the sane reader will regard with acute skepticism—has been
seen to be sound by a rigorously logical demonstration, based on the axioms of
economics, in <i>The Cause of Business Depressions </i>by Hugo Bilgrim and
Edward Levy.*</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">* Economists can &quot;prove&quot; all sorts
of things from axioms and few of them turn out to be true. Yes. We saved for a
footnote the information that at least four empirical demonstrations of the
reverse of Gresham's Law are on record. Three of them, employing small volunteer
communities in frontier U.S.A. circa 1830-1860, are recorded in Josiah Warren's <i>True
Civilization. </i>The fourth, employing contemporary college students in a
psychology laboratory, is the subject of a recent Master's thesis by associate
professor Don Werkheiser of Central State College, Wilberforce, Ohio.</span></p>
