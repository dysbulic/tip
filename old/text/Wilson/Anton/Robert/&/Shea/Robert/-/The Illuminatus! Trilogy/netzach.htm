<p><span style="font-size:18.0pt">(THE SNAFU PRINCIPLE)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most thoroughly and relentlessly Damned, banned, excluded, condemned,
forbidden, ostracized, ignored, suppressed, repressed, robbed, brutalized and
defamed of all Damned Things is the individual human being. The social
engineers, statisticians, psychologists, sociologists, market researchers,
landlords, bureaucrats, captains of industry, bankers, governors, commissars,
kings and presidents are perpetually forcing this Damned Thing into carefully
prepared blueprints and perpetually irritated that the Damned Thing will not fit
into the slot assigned to it. The theologians call it a sinner and try to reform
it The governor calls it a criminal and tries to punish it The psychotherapist
calls it a neurotic and tries to cure it. Still, the Damned Thing will not fit
into their slots.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">—<i>Never Whistle While You're Pissing, </i>by
Hagbard Celine, H.M., S.H.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Midget, whose name was Markoff Chaney, was no relative of the famous
Chaneys of Hollywood, but people <i>did </i>keep making jokes about that. It was
bad enough to be, by the standards of the gigantic and stupid majority, a freak;
how much worse to be so named as to remind these big oversized clods of the
cinema's two most famous portrayers of monstro-freaks; by the time the Midget
was fifteen, he had built up a detestation for ordinary mankind that dwarfed (he
hated that word) the relative misanthropies of Paul of Tarsus, Clement of
Alexandria, Swift of Dublin and even Robert Putney Drake. Revenge, for sure, he
would have. He would have revenge.</p>
<p>It was in college (Antioch, Yellow Springs, 1962) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">that Markoff Chaney discovered another hidden joke in his name, and the
circumstances were—considering that he was to become the worst headache the
Illuminati ever encountered—appropriately synchronistic. It was in a math
class, and, since this was Antioch, the two students directly behind the Midget
were ignoring the professor and discussing their own intellectual interests;
since this was Antioch, they were a good six years ahead of intellectual fads
elsewhere. They were discussing ethology.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;So we keep the same instincts
as our primate ancestors,&quot; one student (he was from Chicago, his name was
Moon, and he was crazy even for Antioch) was saying. &quot;But we superimpose
culture and law on top of this. So we get split in two, dig? You might
say,&quot; Moon's voice betrayed pride in the aphorism he was about to unleash,
&quot;mankind is a statutory ape.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;. . . and,&quot; the professor,
old Fred &quot;Fidgets&quot; Digits, said at just that moment, &quot;when such a
related series appears in a random process, we have what is known as a Markoff
Chain. I hope Mr. Chaney won't be tormented by jokes about this for the rest of
the term, even if the related series of his appearances in class do seem part of
a notably random process.&quot; The class roared; another ton of bile was
entered in the Midget's shit ledger, the list of people who were going to eat
turd before he died.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In fact, his cuts were numerous, both
in math and in other classes. There were tunes when he could not bear to be with
the giants, but hid in his room, <i>Playboy </i>gatefold open, masturbating and
dreaming of millions and millions of nubile young women built like Playmates.
Today, however, <i>Playboy </i>would avail him not; he needed something
raunchier. Ignoring his next class, Physical Anthropology (always good for a few
humiliating moments), he hurried across David Street, pass-big Atlanta Hope
without noticing her, and slammed into his room, chain-bolting the door behind
him.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Damn old Fidgets Digits, and damn the
science of mathematics itself, the line, the square, the average, the whole
measurable world that pronounced him a bizarre random factor. Once and for all,
beyond fantasy, in the depth of his soul he declared war on the statutory ape,
on law and order, on predictability, on negative entropy. He would be a random
factor in every equation; from this day forward, unto death, it would be civil
war: the Midget versus the Digits.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He took out the pornographic Tarot
deck, which he used when he wanted a really far-out fantasy for his orgasm, and
shuffled it thoroughly. Let's have a Mark-off Chain masturbation to start with,
he thought with an evil grin.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And, thus, without ever contacting
the Legion of Dynamic Discord, the Erisian Liberation Front or even the
Justified Ancients of Mummu, Markoff Chaney began his own crusade against the
Illuminati, not even knowing that they existed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">His first overt act—his Fort
Sumter, as it were—began in Dayton the following Saturday. He was in Norton's
Emporium, a glorified 5 &amp; 100 store, when he saw the sign:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">NO
SALESPERSON MAY LEAVE THE FLOOR WITHOUT</span></b><span style="font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">THE
AUTHORIZATION OF A SUPERIOR.</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">THE
MGT</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">What!, </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">he
thought, are the poor girls supposed to pee in their panties if they can't find
a superior? Years of school came back to him (&quot;Please, may I leave the
room, sir?&quot;) and rituals which had appeared nonsensical suddenly made sense
in a sinister way. Mathematics, of course. They were trying to reduce us all to
predictable units, robots. Hah! not for nothing had he spent a semester in
Professor &quot;Sheets&quot; Kelly's intensive course on textual analysis of
modern poetry. The following Wednesday, the Midget was back at Norton's and
hiding in a coffee urn when the staff left and locked up. A few moments later,
the sign was down and a subtly different one was in its place:</span></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">NO SALESPERSON MAY LEAVE THE FLOOR
OR GO TO THE</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">DOOR WITHOUT THE AUTHORIZATION OF
A SUPERIOR.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">THE MGT.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He came back several times in the
next few weeks, and the sign remained. It was as he suspected: in a rigid
hierarchy, nobody questions orders that seem to come from above, and those at
the very top are so isolated from the actual work situation that they never see
what is going on below. It was the chains of communication, not the means of
production, that determined a social process; Marx had been wrong, lacking
cybernetics to enlighten him. Marx was like the engineers of his time, who
thought of electricity in terms of work done, before Marconi thought of it in
terms of information transmitted. Nothing signed &quot;THE MGT.&quot; would ever
be challenged; the Midget could always pass himself off as the Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">At the same tune, he noticed that the
workers were more irritable; the shoppers picked this up and became grouchier
themselves; sales, he guessed correctly, were falling off. Poetry was the
answer: poetry in reverse. His interpolated phrase, with its awkward internal
rhyme and its pointlessness, bothered everybody, but in a subliminal,
preconscious fashion. Let the market researchers and statisticians try to figure
this one out with their computers and averages.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">His father had been a stockholder in
Blue Sky Inc., generally regarded as the worst turkey on the Big Board (it
produced devices to be used in making landings on low-gravity planets); profits
had soared when John Fitzgerald Kennedy had announced that the U.S. would put a
man on the moon before 1970; the Midget now had a guaranteed annuity amounting
to thirty-six hundred dollars per year, three hundred dollars per month. It was
enough for his purposes. Revenge, in good measure, he would have. He would have
revenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Living in Spartan fashion, dining
often on a tin of sardines and a pint of milk from a machine, traveling always
by Greyhound bus, the Midget crisscrossed the country constantly, placing his
improved surrealist signs whenever the opportunity presented itself. A slowly
mounting wave of anarchy followed in his wake. The Illuminati never got a fix on
him: he had little ego to discover, burning all his energies into Drive, like a
dictator or a great painter—but, unlike a dictator or a great painter, he had
no desire for recognition. For years, the Illuminati attributed his efforts to
the Discordians, the JAMs or the esoteric ELF. Watts went up, and Detroit;
Birmingham, Buffalo, Newark, a flaming picnic blanket spread across urban
America as the Midget's signs burned in the stores that had flaunted them; one
hundred thousand marched to the Pentagon and some of them tried to expel the
Demon (the Illuminati foiled that at the last minute, forbidding them to form a
circle); a Democratic convention was held behind barbed wire; in 1970 a Senate
committee announced that there had been three thousand bombings in the year, or
an average of ten per day; by 1973 Morituri groups were forming in every
college, every suburb; the SLA came and came back again; Atlanta Hope was soon
unable to control God's Lightning, which was going in for its own variety of
terrorism years before Illuminati planning had intended.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;There's a random factor
somewhere,&quot; technicians said at Illuminati International; &quot;There's a
random factor somewhere,&quot; Hagbard Celine said, reading the data that came
out of FUCKUP; &quot;There's a random factor somewhere,&quot; the Dealy Lama,
leader of ELF, said dreamily in his underground hideout beneath Dealy Plaza.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drivers on treacherous mountain roads
swore in confusion at signs that said:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">SLIPPERY WHEN WET</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">MAINTAIN 50 M.P.H.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">FALLING ROCK ZONE</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">DO<b> </b>NOT LITTER</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Men paid high initiation fees to
revel in the elegance of all-WASP clubs whose waiters were carefully trained to
be almost as snobbish as the members, then felt vaguely let down by signs
warning them:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">WATCH
YOUR HAT AND COAT</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROPERTY.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">THE
MGT.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The Midget became an electronic
wizard in his spare tune. All over the country, pedestrians stood undecided on
curbs as electric signs said WALK while the light was red and then switched to
DON'T WALK when the light Went green. He branched out and expanded his
activities; office workers received memos early in the morning (after he had
spent a night with a Xerox machine) and puzzled over:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">1. All vacation requests must be
submitted in triplicate to the Personnel Department at least three weeks before
the planned vacation dates.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">2. All employees who change their
vacation plans must notify Personnel Department by completing Form 1472,
Vacation Plan Change, and submitting it three weeks before the change in plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">3. All vacation plans must be
approved by the Department Supervisor and may be changed if they conflict with
the vacation plans of employees of higher rank and/or longer tenure.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">4. Department Supervisors may
announce such cancellations at any time, provided the employee is given 48 hours
notice, or two working days, whichever is longer, as the case may be. (Employees
crossing the International Date Line, see Form 2317.)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">5. Employees may not discuss vacation
plans with other employees or trade preferred dates.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">6. These few simple rules should
prevent a great deal of needless friction and frustration if all</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">employees cooperate, and we will all
have a happy summer.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">THE MGT.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">On April 26 of the year when the
Illuminati tried to immanentize the Eschaton, the Midget experienced aches,
pains, nausea, spots before his eyes, numbness in his legs and dizziness. He
went to the hotel doctor, and a short while after describing his symptoms he was
rushed in a closed car to a building that had a Hopi Indian Kachina Doll Shop in
front and the Las Vegas CIA office in the back. He was fairly delirious by then,
but he heard somebody say, &quot;Ha, we're ahead of the FBI <i>and </i>the
Cesspool Cleaners on this one.&quot; Then he got an injection and began to feel
better, until a friendly silver-haired man sat down by his cot and asked who
&quot;the girl&quot; was.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What girl?&quot; the Midget
asked irritably.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Look, son, we know you've been
with a girl. She gave you this.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Was it the clap?&quot; the
Midget asked, dumbfounded. Except for his pornographic Tarot cards, he was still
a virgin (the giant women were all so damned patronizing, but his own female
equivalents bored him; the giantesses were the Holy Grail to him, but he had
never had the courage to approach one). &quot;I never knew the clap could be
this bad,&quot; he added, blushing. His greatest fear was that somebody would
discover his virginity.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No, it wasn't the clap,&quot;
said the kindly man (who didn't deceive the Midget one bit; if this guy couldn't
pump him, he knew, they would send in the mean, tough one; the nice cop and the
nasty cop; oldest con in the business). &quot;This girl had a certain, uh, rare
disease, and we're with the U.S. Public Health Service.&quot; The gentle man
produced forged credentials to &quot;prove&quot; this last allegation.
Horseshit, the Midget thought. &quot;Now,&quot; the sweet old codger went on,
&quot;we've got to track her down, and see that she gets the antidote, or a lot
of people will get this disease. You understand?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The Midget understood. This guy was
Army Intelligence or CIA and they wanted to crack this before the FBI and get
the credit. The disease was started by the government, obviously. Some fuckup in
one of their biological war laboratories, and they had to cover it up before the
whole country got wise. He hesitated; none of his projects had ever been
consciously intended to lead to death, just to make things a little
unpredictable and spooky for the giants.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The U.S. Public Health Service
will be eternally grateful to you.&quot; the grandfatherly man said, eyes
crinkling with sly affection. &quot;It isn't often that a <i>little </i>man gets
a chance to do such a <i>big </i>job for his country.&quot; That did it
&quot;Well,&quot; the Midget said, &quot;she was blonde, in her mid-twenties I
guess, and she told me her name was Sarah. She had a scar on her neck—I
suppose somebody tried to cut her throat once. She was, let's see, about
five-five and maybe 110-115 pounds. And she was superb at giving</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">head,&quot; he concluded,
thinking that was a very plausible Las Vegas whore he had just created. His mind
was racing rapidly; they wouldn't want people running around loose knowing about
this. The antidote had been to keep him alive while they pumped him. He needed
insurance. &quot;Oh, and here's a real lead for you,&quot; he said &quot;I just
remembered. First, I want to explain something about, uh, people who are below
average in stature. We're very sexy. You see, our sex gland or whatever it's
called works extra, because our growth gland doesn't work. So we never get
enough.&quot; He was making this up off the top of his head and enjoying it. He
hoped it would spread; he had a beautiful vision of bored rich women seeking
midgets as they now seek blacks. &quot;So you see,&quot; he went on, &quot;I
kept her a long time, having encores and encores and encores. Finally, she told
me she'd have to raise her price, because she had another customer waiting. I
couldn't afford it so I let her go.&quot; Now the clincher. &quot;But she
mentioned his name. She </span>said, 'Joe Blotz will be pissed if I disappoint
him,' only the name wasn't Joe Blotz.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's the problem,&quot; the Midget said sadly. &quot;I can't
remember. But if you leave me alone awhile,&quot; he added brightly, &quot;maybe
it'll come back to me.&quot; He was already planning his escape.</p>
<p><i>And, twenty-five hours earlier, George Dorn, quoting Pilate, asked,
&quot;What is Truth?&quot; </i>(Barney Muldoon just then, was lounging in the
lobby of the Hotel Tudor, waiting for Saul to finish what he had called &quot;a
very important, very private conversation&quot; with Rebecca; Nkrumah Fubar was
experimentally placing a voodoo doll of the president of American Express inside
a tetrahedron—their computer was still annoying him about a bill he'd paid
over two months ago, on the very daynight that Soapy Mocenigo dreamed of Anthrax
Leprosy Pi; R. Buckminster Fuller, unaware of this new development in his
geodesic revolution, was lecturing the Royal Institute of Architects in London
and explaining why there were no nouns in the real world; August Personage was
breathing into a telephone in New York; Pearson Mohammed Kent was exuberantly
balling a female who was not only <i>white </i>but <i>from Texas; </i>the Midget
himself was saying &quot;Rude bastard, isn't he?&quot; to Dr. Naismith; and our
other characters were variously pursuing their own hobbies, predilections,
obsessions and holy missions). <i>But Hagbard, with uncharacteristic gravity,
said, </i>&quot;Truth is the opposite of lies. The opposite of most of what
you've heard all your life. The opposite of most of what you've heard from
me.&quot;</p>
<p>They were in Hagbard's funky stateroom and George, after his experience at
the demolished Drake mansion, found the octopi and other sea monsters on the
wall murals distinctly unappetizing. Hagbard, as usual, was wearing a turtleneck
and casual slacks; this time the turtleneck was lavender—an odd, faggoty item
for him. George remembered, suddenly, that</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard had once told him, anent
homosexuality, &quot;I've tried it, of course,&quot; but added something about
liking women better. (Goodness, was that only two mornings ago?) George wondered
what it would be like to &quot;try it&quot; and if he would ever have the nerve.
&quot;What particular lies,&quot; he asked cautiously, &quot;are you about to
confess?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard lit a pipe and passed it
over. &quot;Alamout Black hash,&quot; he said croakingly, holding the smoke
down. &quot;Hassan i Sabbah's own private formula. Does wonders when heavy
metaphysics is coming at you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George inhaled and felt an immediate <i>hit
</i>like cocaine or some other forebrain stimulant. &quot;Christ, what's this
shit cut with?&quot; he gasped, as somebody somewhere seemed to turn colored
lights on in the gold-and-nautical-green room and on that outasight lavender
sweater.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh,&quot; Hagbard said
casually, &quot;a hint of belladonna and stramonium. That was old Hassan's
secret, you know. All that crap in most books about how he had turned his
followers on with hash, and they'd never i had it before so they thought it was
magic, is unhistorical. Hashish was known in the Mideast since the neolithic
age; archeologists have dug it up in tombs. Seems our ancestors buried their
priests with a load of hash to help them negotiate with their gods when they got
to Big Rock Candy Mountain or wherever they thought they were going. Hassan's
originality was blending hashish with just the right chemical cousins to produce
a new synergetic effect.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What's <i>synergetic?&quot; </i>George
asked slowly, feeling seasick for the first time aboard the <i>Leif Erikson.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Nonadditive. When you put two
and two together and get five instead of four. Buckminster Fuller uses
synergetic gimmicks all the time in his geodesic domes. That's why they're
stronger than they look.&quot; Hagbard took another toke and passed the pipe
again.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">What the hell? </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George
thought. Sometimes increasing the dose got you past the nausea. He toked,
deeply. Hadn't they started out to discuss Truth, though?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George giggled. &quot;Just as I
suspected. Instead of using your goddam <i>prajna </i>or whatever it is to spy
on the Illuminati, you're just another dirty old man. You use it to play Peeping
Tom in other people's heads.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Heads?&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard
protested, laughing. &quot;I never scan the <i>heads. </i>Who the hell wants to
watch people eliminating their wastes?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I thought you were going to be
Socrates,&quot; George howled between lunatic peals of tin giggles, &quot;and I
was prepared to be Plato, or at least Glaucon or one of the minor characters.
But you're as stoned as I am. You can't tell me anything important. All you can
do is make bad puns.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The pun,&quot; Hagbard replied
with dignity (ruined somewhat by an unexpected chortle), &quot;is mightier than
the sword. As James Joyce once said.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Don't get pedantic.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Can I get semantic?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes. You can get semantic. Or
antic. But not pedantic.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Where were we?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Truth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes. Well, Truth is like
marijuana, my boy. A drug on the market.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm getting a hard-on.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You too? That's the way the
balling bounces. At least, with Alamout Black. Nausea, then microamnesia, then
the laughing jag, then sex. Be patient. The clear light comes next. Then we can
discuss Truth. As if we haven't been discussing it all along.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You're a hell of a guru,
Hagbard. Sometimes you sound even dumber than me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;If the Elder Malaclypse were
here, he'd tell you a few about some other gurus. And geniuses. Do you think
Jesus never whacked off? Shakespeare never got on a crying jag at the Mermaid
Tavern? Buddha never picked his nose? Gandhi never had the crabs?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I've still got a hard-on. Can't
we postpone the philosophy while I go look for Stella—I mean, Mavis?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's Truth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What is Truth?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Up in the cortex it makes a
difference to you whether it's Stella or Mavis. Down in the glands, no
difference. My grandmother would do as well.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's not Truth. That's just
cheap half-assed Freudian cynicism.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, yes. You saw the mandala
with Mavis.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And you were inside my head
somehow. Dirty voyeur.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Know thyself.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;This will never take its place
beside the Platonic Dialogues, not in a million years. We're both stoned out of
our gourds.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I love you, George.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I guess I love you, too. You're
so damned overwhelming. Everybody loves you. Are we gonna fuck?&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(Mavis had said, &quot;Wipe the
come off your trousers.&quot; Fantasizing Sophia Loren while he masturbated. Or
fantasizing that he masturbated while actually </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">...)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No. You don't need it. You're
starting to remember what really happened in Mad Dog jail.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, no.&quot; Coin's
enormous, snaky cock . </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">. . <i>the
pain. . . the pleasure . </i>. .</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm afraid so.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Damn it, now I'll never know.
Did you put that in my head, or did it really happen? Did I fantasize the
interruption then or did I fantasize the rape just now?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Know thyself.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Did you say that twice or did I
just hear it twice?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What do you think?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I don't know. I don't know,
right now. <i>I </i>just don't know. Is this some devious homosexual
seduction?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Maybe. Maybe it's a murder
plot. Maybe I'm leading up to cutting your throat.&quot; .</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I wouldn't mind. I've always
had a big self-destructive urge. Like all cowards. Cowardice is a defense
against suicide.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard laughed. &quot;I never knew a
young man who had so much pussy and risked death so often. And there you sit,
still worrying about being whatever it was they called you when you first
started letting your hair grow long in your early teens.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sissy. That was the word in
good old Nutley, New Jersey. It meant both faggot and coward. So I've never cut
my hair since then, to prove <i>they </i>couldn't intimidate <i>me.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yeah. I'm tracking a black guy
now, a musician, who's balling a white lady, a fair flower from Texas. Partly,
because she really turns him on. But partly because she could have a brother who
might come after him with a gun. He's proving <i>they </i>can't intimidate <i>him.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's the Truth? We spend all
our time proving we can't be intimidated? But all the time we are intimidated on
another level?&quot; The colors were coming back strong again; it was that kind
of trip. Every time you thought you were the pilot, it would go off in an
unexpected direction to remind you that you were just a passenger.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's part of the Truth,
George. Another part is that every time you think you're intimidated you're
really rebelling on another level. Oh, what idiots the IIluminati really are,
George. I once collected statistics on industrial accidents in a sample
city—Birmingham, England, actually. Fed all the relevant facts into FUCKUP and
got just what I expected. Sabotage. Unconscious sabotage. Every case was a blind
insurrection. Every man and woman is in rebellion, but only a few have the guts
to admit it. The others jam the system by accident, har har har, or by
stupidity, bar bar har again. Let me tell you about the Indians, George.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What Indians?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Did you ever wonder why nothing
works right? Why the whole world seems completely fucked up all the time?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yeah. Doesn't everybody?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I suppose so. Pardon me, I've
got to get more stoned. In a little while, I go into FUCKUP and we put our heads
together—literally, I attach electrodes to my temples—and I'll try to track
down the problem in Las Vegas. I don't spend <i>all </i>my time on random
voyeurism,&quot; Hagbard pronounced with dignity. He refilled the pipe, asking
pettishly, &quot;Where was I?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Indians in Birmingham. How
did they get there?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;There weren't any fucking
Indians in Birmingham. You're getting me confused.&quot; Hagbard toked deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You're getting yourself
confused. You're bombed out of your skull.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Look who's talking.&quot;
Hagbard toked again. &quot;The Indians. The Indians weren't in Birmingham.
Birmingham was where I did the study that convinced me most industrial accidents
are unconscious sabotage. So are most misfiled documents among white-collar
workers, I'd wager. The Indians are another story. I was a lawyer once, when I
first came to your country and before I went in for piracy. I usually don't
admit that, George. I usually tell people I played the piano in a whorehouse or
something else not quite so disreputable as the truth. If you want to know why
nothing makes sense in government forms, remember there are two hundred thousand
lawyers working for the bureaucracy these days.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Indians were a band of
Shoshones. I was defending them against the Great Land Thief, or as it
pretentiously titles itself, the Government, in Washington. We were having a
conference. You know what an Indian conference is like? Nobody talks for hours
sometimes. A good yoga. When somebody does finally speak, you can be sure it
comes from the heart. That old movie stereotype, 'White man speak with forked
tongue,' has a lot of truth in it. The more you talk, the more your imagination
colors things. I'm one of the most long-winded people alive and one of the worst
liars.&quot; Hagbard toked again and finally held the pipe out inquiringly;
George shook his head. &quot;But the story I wanted to tell was about an
archeologist. He was hunting for relics of the Devonian culture, the Indians who
lived in North America just before the ecological catastrophe of 10,000 B.C. He
found what he thought was a burial mound and asked to dig into it. Grok this,
George. The Indians looked at him. They looked at me. They looked at each other.
Then the oldest man spoke and, very gravely, gave permission. The archeologist
hefted his pick and shovel and went at it like John Henry trying to beat that
steam drill. In two minutes he disappeared. Right into a cesspool. Then the
Indians laughed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Grok, </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George.
I knew them as well as any white man ever knows Indians. They had learned to
trust me, and I, them. And yet I sat there, while they played their little joke,
and I didn't get a hint of what was about to happen. Even though I had begun to
discover my telepathic talents and even focus them a little. Think about it,
George. Think about all the pokerfaced blacks you've seen. Think about every
time a black has done something so fantastically, outrageously stupid that you
had a flash of racism—which, being a radical, you were ashamed of,
right?—and wondered if maybe they <i>are </i>inferior. And think of
ninety-nine percent of the women in the Caucasian world, outside Norway, who do
the Dumb Dora or Marilyn Monroe act all the time. Think a minute, George.
Think.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There was a silence that seemed to
stretch into some long hall of near-Buddhist emptiness—George recognized a
glimpse, <i>at last!, </i>into the Void all his acidhead friends had tried to
describe—and then he remembered this was not the trip Hagbard was pushing him
toward. But the silence lingered as a quietness of spirit, a calm in the tornado
of those last few days, and George found himself ruminating with total
dispassion, without hope or dread or smugness or guilt; if not totally without
ego, or in full <i>darshana, </i>at least without the inflamed and voracious ego
that usually either leaped forward or shrunk back from naked fact. He
contemplated his memories and was unmoved, objective, at peace. He thought of
blacks and women and of their subtle revenges against their Masters, acts of
sabotage that could not be recognized clearly as such because they took the form
of acts of obedience; he thought of the Shoshone Indians and their crude joke,
so similar to the jokes of oppressed peoples</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
everywhere; he saw, suddenly, the meaning of Mardi Gras and the Feast of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Fools
and the Saturnalia and the Christmas Office Party and all the other limited,
permissible, structured occasions on which Freud's Return of the Repressed was
allowed; he remembered all the times he had gotten his own back against a
professor, a high school principal, a bureaucrat, or, further back, his own
parents, by waiting for the occasion when, by doing exactly what he was told, he
could produce some form of minor catastrophe. He saw a world of robots, marching
rigidly in the paths laid down for them from above, and each robot partly alive,
partly human, waiting its chance to drop its own monkey wrench into the
machinery. He saw, finally! why everything in the world seemed to work wrong and
the Situation Normal was All Fucked Up. &quot;Hagbard,&quot; he said slowly.
&quot;I think I get it. Genesis is exactly backwards. Our troubles started from
obedience, not disobedience. And humanity is not yet created.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard, more hawk-faced than ever,
said carefully, &quot;You are approaching Truth. Walk cautiously now, George.
Truth is not, as Shakespeare would have it, a dog that can be whipped out to
kennel. Truth is a tiger. Walk cautiously, George.&quot; He turned in his chair,
slid open a drawer in his Danish Modern quasi-Martian desk and took out a
revolver. George watched, as cool and alone as a man atop Everest, as Hagbard
opened the chamber and showed six bullets inside. Then, with a snap, the gun was
closed and placed on the desk blotter. Hagbard did not glance at it again. He
watched George; George watched the pistol. It was the scene with Carlo all over
again, but Hagbard's challenge was unspoken, gnomic; his level glance did not
even admit that a contest had begun. The gun glittered maliciously; it whispered
of all the violence and stealth in the world, treacheries undreamed of by Medici
or Machiavelli, traps set for victims who were innocent and blameless; it seemed
to fill the room with an aura of its presence, and yes, it even had the more
subtle menace of a knife, weapon of the sneak, or of a whip in the hands of a
man whose smile is too sensual, too intimate, too knowing; into the middle of
George's tranquility it had come, inescapable and unexpected as a rattlesnake hi
the path on the afternoon of the sweetest spring day in the world's most
manicured and artificial garden. George heard the adrenalin begin to course into
his bloodstream; saw the &quot;activation syndrome&quot; moisten his palms,
accelerate his heart, loosen his sphincter a micrometer; and still, high and
cool on his mountain, felt nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The robot,&quot; he said,
glancing finally at Hagbard, &quot;is easily upset&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Don't put your hand in that
fire,&quot; Hagbard warned, unimpressed. &quot;You'll get burned.&quot; He
watched; he waited; George could not tear his glance from those eyes and in
them, then, he saw the merriment of Howard, the dolphin, the contempt of his
grade school principal (&quot;A high IQ, Dorn, does not justify arrogance and
insubordination&quot;), the despairing love of his mother, who could never
understand him, the emptiness of Nemo, his tomcat of childhood days, the threat
of Billy Holtz, the school bully, and the total otherness of an insect or a
serpent. More: he saw the child Hagbard, proud like himself of intellectual
superiority and frightened like himself of the malice of stupider but brawnier
boys, and the very old Hagbard, years hence, wrinkled as a reptile but still
showing an endless searching intelligence. The ice melted; the mountain, with a
roar of protest and defiance, crumbled; and George was borne down, down in the
river racing toward the rapids where the gorilla howled and the mouse trotted
quickly, where the saurian head raised above the Triassic foliage, where the sea
slept and the spirals of DNA curled backward toward the flash that was this
radiance now, this raging eternally against the quite impossible dying of the
light, this storm and this centering.</span></p>
<p>&quot;Hagbard . . .&quot; he said at last.</p>
<p>&quot;I know. I can see it. Just don't fall back into that other thing. It's
the Error of the Illuminati.&quot;</p>
<p>George smiled weakly, still not quite back into the world of words. &quot;
'Eat and ye shall be as gods'?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I call it the no-ego ego trip. It's the biggest ego trip of all, of
course. Anybody can learn it. A child of two months, a dog, a cat. But when an
adult rediscovers it, after the habit of obedience and submission has crushed it
out of him for years or decades, what happens can be a total disaster. That's
why the Zen Roshis say, 'One who achieves supreme illumination is like an arrow
flying straight to hell.' Keep in mind what I said about caution, George. You
can release at any moment. It's great up there, and you need a mantra to keep
you away from it until you learn how to use it. Here's your mantra, and if you
knew the peril you are in you'd brutally burn it into your backside with a
branding iron to make sure you'd never forget it: I Am The Robot. Repeat
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I Am The Robot.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagbard made a face like a baboon and George laughed again, at last.
&quot;When you get tune,&quot; Hagbard said, &quot;look into my little book, <i>Never
Whistle While You're Pissing—</i>there are copies all over the ship. That's <i>my
</i>ego tip. And keep it in mind: you are the robot and you'll never be anything
else. Of course, you're also the programmer, and even the meta-programmer; but
that's another lesson, for another day. For now, just remember the mammal, the
robot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; George said. &quot;I've read T. S. Eliot, and now I
understand him. 'Humility is endless.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And humanity <i>is </i>created. The . . . other ... is not human.&quot;</p>
<p>George said then, &quot;So I've arrived. And it's just another starting
place. The beginning of another trip. A harder trip.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's another meaning in Heracleitus. &quot;The end is the
beginning.'&quot; Hagbard rose and shook himself like a dog. &quot;Wow,&quot; he
said. &quot;I better get to work with</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">FUCKUP. You can stay here or go to
your own room, but I suggest that you don't rush off and talk about your
experience to somebody else. You can talk it to death that way.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George remained in Hagbard's room and
reflected on what had happened. He had no urge to scribble in his diary, the
usual defense against silence and aloneness since his early teens. Instead, he
savored the stillness of the room and of his inner core. He remembered Saint
Francis of Assisi called his body &quot;Brother Ass,&quot; and Timothy Leary
used to say when exhausted, &quot;The robot needs sleep.&quot; Those had been
their mantras, their defenses against the experience of the mountaintop and the
terrible arrogance it triggered. He remembered, too, the old classic underground
press ad: &quot;Keep me high and I'll ball you forever.&quot; He felt sorry for
the woman who had written that: pitiful modern version of the maddened Saint
Simon on his pillar in the desert. And Hagbard was right: any dog or cat could
do it, could make the jump to the mountaintop and wait without passion until the
robot, Brother Ass, survived the ordeal or perished in it. That was what
primitive rites of initiation were all about—driving the youth through sheer
terror to the point of letting go, the mountaintop point, and then bringing him
back down again. George suddenly understood how his generation, in rediscovering
the sacred drugs, had failed to rediscover their proper use ... had failed, or
had been prevented. The Illuminati, it was clear, didn't want any competition in
the godmanship business.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">You could talk it to death in your
own head as well as in conversation, he realized, but he went back over it again
trying to dissect it without mutilating it. The homosexuality bit had been a
false front (with its own reality, of course, like all false fronts). Behind
that was the conditioned terror against the Robot: the fear, symbolized in
Frankenstein and dozens of other archetypes, that if it were let loose,
unrestrained, the Robot would run amok, murder, rape, go mad . . . And then
Hagbard had waited until the Alamout Black brought him to freedom, showed him
the peak, the place where the cortex at last could idle, as a car motor or a dog
or cat idles, the last refuge where the catatonic hides. When George was safely
in that harbor, Hagbard produced the gun—in a more primitive, or more
sophisticated, society, it would have been the emblem of a powerful demon—and
George saw that he could, indeed, idle there and not blindly follow the panic
signals from the Robot's adrenalin factory. And, because he was a human and not
a dog, the experience had been ecstasy to him, and temptation, so Hagbard, with
a few words and a glance from those eyes, pushed him off the peak into . . .
what?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Reconciliation was the word.
Reconciliation with the robot, with the Robot, with himself. The peak was not a
victory; it was the war, the eternal war against the Robot, carried to a higher
and more dangerous level. The end of the war was his surrender, the only
possible end to that war, since the Robot was three billion years old and
couldn't be killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There were two great errors in the
world, he perceived: the error of the submissive hordes, who fought all their
lives to control the Robot and please their masters (and who always sabotaged
every effort without knowing it, and were in turn sabotaged by the Robot's
Revenge: neuroses, psychoses and all the tiresome list of psychosomatic
ailments); and the error of those who recaptured the animal art of letting the
Robot run itself, and who then tried to maintain this split from their own flesh
indefinitely, until they were lost forever in that eternally widening chasm. One
sought to batter the Robot to submission, the other to slowly starve it; both
were wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And yet, on another plane of his
still-zonked mind, George knew that even this was a half truth; that he was,
indeed, just beginning his journey, not arriving at his destination. He rose and
walked to the bookshelves and, as he expected, found a stack of Hagbard's little
pamphlets on the bottom: <i>Never Whistle While You're Pissing, </i>by Hagbard
Celine, H.M., S.H. He wondered what the H.M. and S.H. stood for, then flipped
open to the first page, where he found only the large question:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>WHO</b></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">IS THE ONE MORE TRUSTWORTHY</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">THAN</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ALL THE BUDDHAS</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">AND SAGES</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">??</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George laughed out loud. The Robot,
of course. Me. George Dorn. All three billion years' worth of evolution in every
gene and chromosome of me. And that, of course, was what the Illuminati (and all
the petty would-be Illuminati who made up power structures everywhere) never
wanted a man or woman to realize.</span></p>
<p style="tab-stops:270.0pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George
turned to the second page and began reading:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">If you whistle while you're pissing,
you have two minds where one is quite sufficient. If you have two minds, you are
at war with yourself. If you are at war with yourself, it is easy for an
external force to defeat you. This is why Mong-tse wrote, &quot;A man must
destroy himself before others can destroy him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That was all, except for an abstract
drawing on page three that seemed to suggest an enemy figure moving out toward
the viewer. About to turn to page four, George got a shock: from another angle,
the drawing was two figures engaged in attacking each other. I and It. The Mind
and the Robot. His memory leaped back twenty-two years and he saw his mother
lean over the crib and remove his hand from his penis. Christ, no wonder I grab
it when I'm frightened: the Robot's Revenge, the Return of the Repressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George started to turn the page
again, and saw another trick in Hagbard's abstraction: from a third an-</span></p>
<p>gle, it might be a couple making love. In a flash, he saw his mother's face
above his crib again, in better focus, and recognized the concern in her eyes.
The cruel hand of repression was moved by love: she was trying to save him from
Sin.</p>
<p>And Carlo, dead three years now, together with the rest of that Morituri
group—what had inspired Carlo when he and the four others (all of them less
than eighteen, George remembered) blasted their way into a God's Lightning rally
and killed three cops and four Secret Service agents in their attempts to gun
down the Secretary of State? Love, nothing but mad love ...</p>
<p>The door opened and George tore his eyes from the text. Mavis, back again in
her sweater and slacks outfit, walked in. For a proclaimed right-wing anarchist,
she sure dresses a lot like a New Leftist, George thought; but then Hagbard
wrote like a cross between Reichian Leftist and an egomaniacal Zen
Master—there was obviously more to the Discordian philosophy than he could
grasp yet, even though he was now convinced it was the system he himself had
been groping toward for many years.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm,&quot; she said, &quot;I like that smell. Alamout Black?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; George said, having trouble meeting her eyes.
&quot;Hagbard's been illuminating me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can tell. Is that why you suddenly feel uncomfortable with me?&quot;</p>
<p>George met her eyes, then looked away again; there was tenderness there but
it was, as he had expected, sisterly at best. He muttered, &quot;It's just that
I realize our sex&quot; (why couldn't he say fucking or, at least, balling?)
&quot;was less important to you than to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Mavis took Hagbard's chair and smiled at him affectionately. &quot;You're
lying, George. You mean it was <i>more </i>important to me than to you.&quot;
She began to refill the pipe; <i>Christ God, </i>George thought, <i>did Hagbard
send her in to take me to the next stage, whatever it is?</i></p>
<p>&quot;Well, I guess I mean both,&quot; he said cautiously. &quot;You were
more emotionally involved than I was <i>then,</i></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">but <i>now </i>I'm more emotionally
involved. And I know that what I want, I can't have. Ever.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Ever is a long time. Let's just
say you can't have it now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot; 'Humility is endless,' &quot;
George repeated.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Don't start feeling sorry for
yourself. You've discovered that love is more than a word in poetry, and you
want it right away. You just had two other things that used to be just words to
you—<i>sunyata </i>and <i>satori. </i>Isn't that enough for one day?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm not complaining. I know
that 'humility is endless' also means surprise is endless. Hagbard promised me a
happy truth and that's it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mavis finally got the pipe lit and,
after toking deeply, passed it over. &quot;You can have Hagbard,&quot; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George, sipping very lightly since he
was still fairly high, mumbled &quot;Hm?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hagbard will love you as well
as ball you. Of course, it's not the same. He loves everybody. I'm not at that
stage yet. I can only love my equals.&quot; She grinned wickedly. &quot;Of
course, I can still get horny about you. But now that you know there's more than
that, you want the whole package deal, right? So try Hagbard.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George laughed, feeling suddenly
lighthearted. &quot;Okay! I will.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Bullshit,&quot; Mavis said
bluntly. &quot;You're putting us both on. You've liberated some of the energies
and right away, like everybody else at this stage, you want to prove that there
are no blocks anywhere anymore. That laugh was not convincing, George. If you
have a block, face it. Don't pretend it isn't there.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Humility is endless, </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George
thought. &quot;You're right,&quot; he said, unabashed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's better. At least you
didn't fall into feeling guilty about the block. That's an infinite regress. The
next stage is to feel guilty about feeling guilty . . . and pretty soon you're
back in the trap again, trying to be the governor of the nation of Dorn.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Robot,&quot; George said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mavis toked and said, &quot;Mm?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I call it the Robot.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You picked that up from Leary
back in the mid-'60s. I keep forgetting you were a child prodigy. I can just see
you, with your eyeglasses and your shoulders all hunched, poring over one of
Tim's books when you were eight or nine. You must have been quite a child.
They've sure mauled you over since then, haven't they?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It happens to most prodigies.
And nonprodigies, too, for that matter.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yeah. Eight years' grade
school, four high school, four college, then postgraduate studies. Nothing left
but the Robot at the end. The ever-rebellious nation of Me with poor old I
sitting on the throne trying to govern it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;There's no governor
anywhere,&quot; George quoted.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You <i>are </i>coming along
nicely.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's Chuang Chou, the Taoist
philosopher. But I never understood him before.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;So that's where Hagbard stole
it! He has little cards that say, 'There is no enemy anywhere.' And ones that
say, 'There is no friend anywhere.' He said once he could tell in two minutes
which card was right for a particular person. To jolt them awake.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;But words alone can't do it.
I've known most of the words for years . . .&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Words can help. In the right
situation. If they're the wrong words. I mean, the right words. No, I <i>do </i>mean
the wrong words.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">They laughed, and George said,
&quot;Are we just goofing, or are you taking up the liberation of the nation of
Dorn where Hagbard left off?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Just goofing. Hagbard did tell
me that you had passed one of the gateless gates and that I might drop in, <i>after
</i>you had a while alone.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;A gateless gate. That's another
one I've known for years, without understanding it. The gateless gate and the
governorless nation. The chief cause of socialism is</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">capitalism. What the hell does that
bloody apple have to do with all this?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The apple is the world. Who did
Goddess say owns it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot; 'The prettiest one.' &quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Who is the prettiest one?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You are.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Don't make a pass right now.
Think.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George giggled. &quot;I've been
through too much already. I think I'm getting sleepy. I have two answers, one
communist and one fascist. Both are wrong, of course. The correct answer has to
fit in with your anarcho-capitalism.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Not necessarily.
Anarcho-capitalism is just <i>our </i>trip. We don't mean to impose it on
everybody. We have an alliance with an anarcho-communist group called the JAMs.
John Dillinger's their leader.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Come off it. Dillinger died in
1935 or something.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;John Dillinger is alive and
well today, in California, Fernando Poo and Texas,&quot; Mavis smiled. &quot;As
a matter of fact, he shot John F. Kennedy.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Give me another toke. If I have
to listen to this, I might as well be in a state where I won't try to understand
it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mavis passed the pipe. &quot;The
prettiest one has quite a few levels to it, like all good jokes. I'll give you
the Freudian one, as beginners. You know the prettiest one, George. You gave it
to the apple just yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Every man's penis is the
prettiest thing in the world to him. From the day he's born until the day he
dies. It never loses its endless fascination. And, I kid you not, baby, the same
is true of every woman and her pussy. It's the closest thing to a real, blind,
helpless love and religious adoration that most people ever achieve. But they'd
rather die than admit it. Homosexuality, the urge to kill, petty spites and
treacheries, fantasies of sadism, masochism, transvestism, any weird thing you
can name, they'll confess all that in a group therapy session. But that deep
submerged constant narcissism, that perpetual mental masturbation, is the
earliest and</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">most powerful block. They'll never
admit it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;From what I've read of
psychiatric literature, I thought most people had rather squeamish and negative
feelings about their genitals.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That, to quote Freud himself,
is a reaction formation. The primordial emotional tone, from the day the infant
discovers the incredible pleasure centers there, is perpetual astonishment, awe
and delight. No matter how much society tries to crush it and repress it. For
instance, everybody has some pet name for their genitals. What's yours?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Polyphemus,&quot; he confessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Because it has one eye, you
know? Also, Polyphemus rhymes with penis, I guess. I mean, I can't remember
exactly what my mental process was when I invented that in my early teens.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Polyphemus was a giant, too.
Almost a god. You see what I mean about the primary emotional tone? It's the
origin of all religion. Adoration of your own genitals and of your lover's
genitals. <i>There's </i>Pan Pangeni-tor and the Great Mother.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;So,&quot; George said owlishly,
still not sure whether this was profundity or nonsense, &quot;the earth belongs
to our genitalia?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;To their offspring, and their
offspring's offspring, and so on, forever. The world is a verb, not a
noun.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The prettiest one is three
billion years old.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You've got it, baby. We're all
tenants here, including the ones who think they're owners. Property is
impossible.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Okay, okay, I think I've got
most of it. Property is theft because the Illuminati land titles are arbitrary
and unjust. And so are their banking charters and railroad franchises and all
the other monopoly games of capitalism—&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Of state capitalism. Not of
true laissez-faire.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Wait. Property is impossible
because the world is a verb, a burning house as Buddha said. All things are
fire. My old pal Heracleitus. So property is theft and</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">property is impossible. How do we get
to property is liberty?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Without private property there
can be no private decisions.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;So we're back where we started
from?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No, we're one flight higher up
on the spiral staircase. Look at it that way. Dialectically, as your Marxist
Mends say.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;But we <i>care </i>back at
private property. After proving it's an impossible fiction.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Statist form of private
property is an impossible fiction. Just like the Statist form of communal
property is an impossible fiction. Think outside the State framework, George.
Think of property in freedom.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George shook his head. &quot;It beats
the hell out of my ass. All I can see is people ripping each other off. The war
of all against all, as what's-his-name said.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hobbes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hobbes, snobs, jobs. Whoever.
Or whatever. Isn't he right?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Stop the motor on this
submarine.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Force me to love you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Wait, I don't . . .&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Turn the sky green or red,
instead of blue.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I still don't get it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mavis took a pen oft* the desk and
held it between two fingers. &quot;What happens when I let go of this?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It falls.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Where do you sit if there are
no chairs?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;On the floor?&quot; <i>If I</i>
<i>wasn't so stoned, I would have had it by then. Sometimes drugs are more a
hindrance than a help. </i>&quot;On the ground?&quot; I added.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;On your ass, that's for
sure.&quot; Mavis said. &quot;The point is, if the chairs all go away, you still
sit. Or you build new chairs.&quot; She was stoned, too; otherwise she'd be</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">explaining it better, I realized.
&quot;But you can't stop the motor without learning something about marine
engineering first. You don't know what switch to pull. Or switches. And you
can't change the sky. And the pen will fall without a gravity-governing demon
rushing into the room to make it fall.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Shit and pink petunias,&quot; I
said disgustedly. &quot;Is this some form of Thomism? Are you trying to sell me
the Natural Law argument? I can't buy that at all.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Okay, George. Here's the next
jolt. Keep your asshole tight.&quot; She spoke to the wall, to a hidden
microphone, I guessed. &quot;Send <i>him </i>in now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The Robot is easily upset; my
sphincter was already tightening as soon as she warned me there was a jolt
coming and she didn't really need to add that bit about my asshole. Carlo and
his gun. Hagbard and his gun. Drake's mansion. I took a deep breath and waited
to see what the Robot would do.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A panel in the wall opened and Harry
Coin was pushed into the room. I had time to think that I should have guessed,
in this game where both sides were playing with illusion constantly, Coin's
death could have been faked, artificial intestines dangling and all, and of
course Mavis and her raiders could have taken him out of Mad Dog jail even
before they took me out of course, and I remembered the pain when he slapped my
face and when his cock entered me, and the Robot was already moving, and I
hardly had time to aim of course, and then his head was banging against the
wall, blood spurting from his nose, and I had time to clip him again on the jaw
as he went down of course, and then I came all the way back and stopped myself
as I was about to kick him in the face as he lay there unconscious. Zen in the
art of face-punching. I had knocked a man out with two blows; I who hated
Hemingway and Machismo so much that I'd never taken a boxing lesson in my life.
I was breathing hard, but it was good and clean, the feeling of after-an-orgasm;
the adrenalin was flowing, but a fight reflex instead of a flight reflex had
been triggered, and now it over, and I was calm. A glint in the air: Hagbard's
pistol was in Mavis's hand, then flying toward me. As I caught it, she said,
&quot;Finish the bastard.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But the rage had ended when I held
back the kick on seeing him already unconscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;It <i>is
</i>finished.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Not until you kill him. You're
no good to us until you're ready to kill, George.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I ignored her and rapped on the wall.
&quot;Haul the bastard out,&quot; I said clearly. The panel opened, and two
Slavic-looking seamen, grinning, grabbed Coin's arms and dragged him out. The
panel closed again, quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I don't kill on command,&quot;
I said, turning back to Mavis. &quot;I'm not a German shepherd or a draftee. <i>My
</i>case with him is settled, and if you want him dead, do the dirty work
yourself.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But Mavis was smiling placidly.
&quot;Is that a Natural Law?&quot; she asked.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And twenty-three hours later
Tobias Knight listened to the voice in his earphones: </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's
the problem. I can't remember. But if you leave me alone for a while maybe it'll
come back to me.&quot; Smoothing his mustache nervously, Knight set the button
for automatic record, removed the earphones and buzzed Esperando Despond's
office.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Despond,&quot; the intercom
said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The CIA has one. A man who was
with the girl after Mocenigo. Send somebody down for the tape—it's got a
pretty good description of the girl.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Wilco,&quot; Despond said
tersely. &quot;Anything else?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;He thinks he might remember the
name of her next customer. She mentioned it to him. We might get that,
too.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Let's hope so,&quot; Despond
said and clicked off. He sat back in his chair and addressed the three agents in
his office. &quot;The guy we've got—what's Ms name? Naismith—is probably the
next customer. We'll check the two descriptions of the girl against each other
and get a much more accurate picture than the CIA has, since they're working
from only one description.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But fifteen minutes later, he was
staring in puzzlement at the chart which had been chalked on the blackboard:</span></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">DESCRIPTIONS OF SUSPECT</span></b></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">First Witness Second Witness </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Height

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A tall, bearish agent named Roy Ubu
said thoughtfully, &quot;I've never seen two eyewitness descriptions match
exactly, but <i>this . </i>. .&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A small, waspish agent named Buzz
Vespa snapped, &quot;One of them is lying for some reason. But which one?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Neither of them has any reason
to lie,&quot; Despond said. &quot;Gentlemen, we've got to face the facts. Dr.
Mo-cenigo was unworthy of the trust that the U.S. government placed in him. He
was a degenerate sex maniac. He had <i>two </i>women last night, one of them a
Nigra.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What do you mean that little
sawed-off bastard is gone?&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">Peter Kurten of the CIA was shouting at that very moment. &quot;The only
way out of his room was right</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">through
that door, there, and we've all had it under constant surveillance. The door was
only opened once when DeSalvo took out the coffee urn to have it refilled at the
sandwich shop next door. Oh ... my ... <i>God . . . </i>the . . . <i>coffee . </i>.
. <i>urn . . </i>.&quot; As he slumped back in his chair, mouth hanging open, an
agent with a device that looked like a mine sweeper stepped forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Daily sweep for FBI bugs,
sir,&quot; he said uncomfortably. &quot;I'm afraid the machine is registering
one under your desk. If you'll let me just reach in and . . . uh . . .that gets
it ...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And Tobias Knight, listening, heard
no more. It would be a few hours, at least, until their man in the CIA was able
to plant a new bug.</span></p>
<p>And Saul Goodman stepped hard on the brakes of his rented Ford Brontosaurus
as a tiny and determined figure, dashing out of the Papa Mescalito Sandwich
Shop, ran right in front of the fender. Saul heard a sickening thud and Barney
Muldoon's voice beside him saying, &quot;Oh Christ, no ...&quot;</p>
<p>/ <i>was at the end of my ropes. The Syndicate I could see, but why the Feds?
</i>I was flabbygastered. I said to that dumb cunt Bonnie Quint, &quot;Are you a
thousand percent sure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Carmel,&quot; she says. &quot;I know the Syndicate. They're not that
smooth. These guys were just what they claimed. Feds.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, Christ Jesus. Christ Jesus with egg in his beard. I couldn't help myself,
I just hauled off and bopped her in the kisser, the dumb cunt. &quot;What'd you
tell them?&quot; I screamed. &quot;What'd you tell them?&quot;</p>
<p>She started to snivel. &quot;I didn't tell them nothing,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>So I had to bop her again. Christ, I hate hitting women, they always blubber
so much. &quot;I'll use the belt,&quot; I howled. &quot;So help me, God, I'll
use the belt Don't tell me you didn't tell them nothing. Everybody tells them
something. Even a clam would sing like Sinatra when they're finished with him.
So what'd you tell them?&quot; I bopped her again, Christ, this was terrible.</p>
<p>&quot;I just told them I wasn't with this Mocenigo. Which I wasn't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So who did you tell them you were with?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I made up a prescription. A midget. A guy I saw on the street. I
wouldn't give the name of a real John, I know that could come back against you.
And me.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do, so I bopped her again. &quot;Go away,&quot; I says.
&quot;Be missing. Let me think.&quot;</p>
<p>She goes out, still blubbering, and I go over to the window and look at the
desert to calm my head. My rose fever was starting to act up; it was that time
of year. Why did people have to bring roses to the desert? I tried to
contemplate hard on the problem and forget <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">my health. There was only one explanation: that damned Mocenigo figured
out that Sherri was pumping him and told the Feds. The Syndicate wasn't in it
yet They were all still running around the East like chickens with their legs
cut off, trying to figure who rubbed Maldonado, and why it happened at the house
of a straight like this banker Drake. So they hadn't got the time yet to find
out that five million of Banana Nose's money had disappeared into my own safe as
soon as I heard he was dead. The Feds weren't in on that at all, and the
connection was circumsubstantial.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And then it hit me so hard that I
almost fell over. Besides my own girls, who wouldn't talk, there were a dozen or
two cab drivers and bartenders and whatnots who knew that Sherri worked for me.
The Feds would get it out of somebody sooner or later, and probably sooner. It
was like a light bulb going on over my head in a comic strip: TREASON. AIDING
AND ABEDDING THE ENEMY. I remembered from when I was a kid those two Jewish
scientists who the Feds got for that. The hot squat. They fried them, Christ
Jesus, I thought I'd vomit. Why does the fucking government have to be that way
about somebody just trying to make a buck? Even the Syndicate would only shoot
you or give you a lead enema, but the cocksucking government has to go and put
you in an electrical chair. Christ Jesus, I was hot as a chimney.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I took a candy out of my pocket and
started chewing it, trying to think what to do. If I ran, the Syndicate would
guess I was the one who emptied the till when Maldonado was rubbed, and they'd
get me. If I <i>didn't </i>run, the Feds would be at the door with a high
treason warrant. It was a double whammy. I might try to highjack a plane to
Panama, but I didn't know nearly enough about Mocenigo's bugs to make a deal
with the Commie government down there. They'd just send me right back. It was
hopeless, like trying to fill a three-card inside straight. The only thing to do
was find a hole and bury myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And then it was just like a light
bulb in my head</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">again, and I thought: Lehman Cave.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What does the computer say
now?&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">the President
asked the Attorney General.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What does the computer say
now?&quot; the Attorney General barked into the open phone before him.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;If the girl had two contacts
before she died, at this moment the possible carriers number,&quot; the phone
paused, &quot;428,000. If the girl had three contacts, 7,-656,000.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Get the Special Agent in
Charge,&quot; the President snapped. He was the calmest man at the table—ever
since Fernando Poo, he had been supplementing his Librium, Tofranil and Elovil
with Demerol, the amazing little pills that had kept Hermann Goering so chipper
and cheerful during the Nuremberg Trials while all the other Nazis</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">crumbled into catatonic, paranoid
or other dysfunctional conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Despond,&quot; a second open
phone said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;This is your President,&quot;
the President said. &quot;Give it to us straight. Have you treed the coon?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Uh, sir, no, sir. We have to
find the procurer, sir. The girl can't possibly be alive, but we haven't found
her. It is now mathematically certain that somebody hid her body. The obvious
theory, sir, is that her procurer, being in an illegal business, hid the body
rather than report it. We have two descriptions of the girl, sir, and, uh,
although they don't tally <i>completely </i>they should lead us to her procurer.
Of course, he should die soon, sir, and then we'll find him. That's the Rubicon
of the case, sir. Meanwhile, I'm happy to report, sir, that we're lucking out
amazingly. Only two definite cases off the base so far and both of them injected
with the antidote. It is possible, just possible, that the procurer went into
hiding after disposing of the body. In that case, he hasn't contacted another
human being and is not spreading it. Sir.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Despond,&quot; the President
said, &quot;I want <i>results. </i>Keep us informed. Your country depends on
you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i>&quot;Tree that coon, </i>Despond.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;We will, sir.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Esperando Despond turned from the
phone as an agent from the computer section entered the room. &quot;Got
something?&quot; he snapped nervously.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The first girl, the Nigra, sir.
She was one of the pros we questioned yesterday. Her name is Bonnie Quint.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You look worried. Is there a
hitch?&quot; Despond asked shrewdly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Just another of the puzzles.
She didn't admit being with Mocenigo the night before, but that kind of lying we
expected. Here's what's weird: her description of the guy she says she <i>was </i>with.&quot;
The computer man shook his head dubiously. &quot;It doesn't fit Naismith, the
guy who said he was with <i>her. </i>It fits the little mug, the dwarf, that the
CIA grabbed. Only <i>he </i>said she was the second girl.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Despond mopped his brow. &quot;What
the heck has been going on in this town?&quot; he asked the ceiling. &quot;Some
kind of <i>sex </i>orgy?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In fact, several kinds of sex orgies
had been going on in Las Vegas ever since the Veterans of the Sexual Revolution
had arrived two days earlier. The Hugh M. Hefner Brigade had taken two stories
of the Sands, hired a herd of professional women, and hadn't yet come out to
join the Alfred Kinsey Brigade, the Norman Mailer Guerrillas and the others in
marching up and down the Strip, squirting young girls in the crotch with water
pistols, passing bottles of hooch back and forth and generally blocking traffic
and annoying pedestrians. Dr. Naismith himself, after a few token appearances,
had avoided most of the merriment and retired to a private suite to work on his
latest fund-raising letter for the Colossus of Yorba Linda Foundation. Actually,
the VSR, like White Heroes Opposing Red Extremism, was one of Naismith's lesser
projects and brought in only peanuts. Most of the real veterans of the sexual
revolution had succumbed to syphilis, marriage, children, alimony or some such
ailment, and few white heroes were prepared to oppose red extremism in</span></p>
<p>the bizarre manner suggested by Naismith's pamphlets; in both of those cases,
he had recognized two nut markets that nobody else was exploiting and had
quickly moved in. Even the John Dillinger Died For You Society, of which he was
inordinately proud since it was probably the most implausible religion in the
long history of humanity's infatuation with metaphysics, didn't earn much less
per annum than these fancies. The real bread was in the Colossus of Yorba Linda
Foundation, which had been successfully raising money for several years to erect
a heroic monument, in solid gold and <i>ten feet taller than the statue of
Liberty, </i>honoring the martyred former president Richard Milhous Nixon. This
monument, paid for entirely by the twenty million Americans who still loved and
revered Nixon despite the damnable lies of the Congress, the Justice Department,
the press, the TV, the law courts, <i>et al., </i>would stand outside Yorba
Linda, Tricky Dicky's boyhood home, and scowl menacingly toward Asia, warning
those gooks not to try to get the jump on Uncle Sammie. Beside the gigantic
idol's right foot, Checkers looked adoringly upward; beneath the left foot was a
crushed allegorical figure representing Cesar Chavez. The Great Man held a bunch
of lettuce in his right hand and a tape recording in the left. It was all most
tasteful, and so appealed to Fundamentalist Americans that hundreds of thousands
of dollars had already been collected by the Colossus fund, and Naismith planned
to hop to Nepal with the loot at the first sign that contributors or postal
inspectors were beginning to wonder when the statue would actually start rising
on the plot he had purchased, amid much publicity, after the first few thousand
arrived.</p>
<p>Naismith was a small, slight man and, like many Texans, affected a cowboy hat
(although he had never herded cattle) and a bandito mustache (although his
thefts were all based on fraud rather than force). He was also, for his nation
at this time in history, an uncommonly honest man, and, unlike most corporations
of the epoch, none of his enterprises had poi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">soned
or mutilated the customers whose money he took. His one vice was cynicism based
on lack of imagination: he reckoned most of his countrymen as total mental
basket cases and fondly believed that he was exploiting their folly when he told
them that a vast Illiminati conspiracy controlled the money supply and interest
rates or that a bandit of the 1930s was, in a sense, a redeemer of the
atrophying human spirit. That there was an element of truth in these bizarre
notions never crossed his mind. In short, even though born in Texas, Naismith
was as alienated from the pulse, the poetry and the profundity of American
emotion as a New York intellectual.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But his cynicism served him well
when, after reporting certain strange symptoms to the hotel doctor, he found
himself rushed to a supposed U.S. Public Health Service station which was manned
by individuals he quickly recognized as <i>laws. </i>This is an old Texas word,
probably an abbreviation of <i>lawmen </i>(Texans don't know much about
abbreviating) and is as charged with suspicion and wariness, although not quite
so much rage, as the New Left's word <i>pig. </i>Bonnie Parker had used it,
eloquently, in her last ballad:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Someday they'll go down together</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">They'll bury them side by side</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">For some it means grief</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">For the laws a relief</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That about summed it up: the <i>laws </i>were
not necessarily fascist Gestapo racist pigs (words largely unknown in Texas),
but they were people who would find it a relief if bothersome and rebellious
individualism disappeared, however bloody the disappearance might be. If you
were ornery enough, the laws would bushwhack you—shoot you dead from ambush,
without a chance to surrender, as they did to Miss Parker and Mr. Barrow—but
even if you were merely a mildly larcenous hoaxter like Dr. Naismith, they would
be much cheered to put you someplace where you couldn't throw any more entropy
into the functioning of the Machine they served. And so, recognizing laws, Dr.<b>
</b>Naismith narrowed his eyes, thought deeply, and when they began their
questioning, lied as only an unregenerate old-school Texas confidence man can
lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You got it from somebody who
had body contact with you. So either you were in a very crowded elevator or you
got it from a prostitute. Which was it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Naismith thought of the collision on
the sidewalk with the Midget and the weasel-faced character with the big
suitcase, but he also thought that the questioner leaned heavily on the second
possibility. They were looking for a woman; and, if you tell the laws what they
want to hear, they don't keep coming back and asking more personal questions.
&quot;I was with a prostitute,&quot; he said, trying to sound embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Can you describe her?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He thought back over the pros he had
seen with other VSR delegates, and one stood out Being a kindly man, he didn't
want to implicate an innocent whore in this messy business (whatever it was), so
he combined her with another woman, the first that he ever successfully
penetrated in his long-ago youth in the 1950s.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Unfortunately for Dr. Naismith's
kindly intentions, the laws never expect an eyewitness description to match the
person described in <i>all </i>respects, so when his information was coded into
an IBM machine, three cards came out. Each one had more similarities to his
fiction than differences from it, and they came from a card file of several
hundred prostitutes whose descriptions had been gathered and coded in the past
twenty-four hours. Running the three cards through a different sorting in the
machine, limited to outstanding bodily characteristics most commonly remembered
correctly, the technicians emerged, after all, with Bonnie Quint. Forty-five
minutes later she was in Esperando Despond's office, nervously twirling her mink
stole, picking at the hem of her mini-skirt, evading questions nimbly and
remembering intensely Camel's voice saying, &quot;I'll use the belt. So help me,
God. I'll use the belt.&quot; She was also smarting from the injection.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You <i>don't </i>work
free-lance,&quot; Despond told her, nastily, for the fifth time. &quot;In this
town, the Maf would put a knife up your ass and break off the handle if you
tried that. You've got a pimp. Now, do we throw the book at you or do we get his
name?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Don't be too hard on her,&quot;
Tobias Knight said. &quot;She's only a poor, confused kid. Not twenty yet, are
you?&quot; he asked her kindly. &quot;Give her a chance to think. She'll do the
right thing. Why should she protect a lousy pimp who exploits her all the
time?&quot; He gave her a reassuring glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Poor confused kid, my
ass!&quot; Despond exploded. &quot;This is a matter of life and death and no
Nigra whore is going to sit here lying her head off and get away with it.&quot;
He did a good imitation of a man literally trembling with repressed fury.
&quot;I'd like to kick her head in,&quot; he screamed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Knight, still playing the friendly
cop, looked shocked. &quot;That's not very professional,&quot; he said sadly.
&quot;You're overtired, and you're frightening the child.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Three hours later—after Despond had
nearly done a complete psycho schtick and virtually threatened to behead poor
Bonnie with his letter opener, and Knight had become so fatherly and protective
that both he and she were beginning to feel that she was actually his very own
six-year-old daughter being set upon by Goths and Vandals—a sobbing but
accurate description of Carmel emerged, including his address.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Twelve minutes later, Roy Ubu,
calling via car radio, reported that Carmel was not in his house and had been
seen driving toward the Southwest in a jeep with a large suitcase beside him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In the next eighteen
hours, eleven men in jeeps were stopped on various roads southwest of Las Vegas,
but none of them was Carmel, although most of them were </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">around
the height and weight and general physical description given by Bonnie Quint,
and two of them even had large suitcases. In the twenty-four hours after that,
nearly a thousand men of all sizes and shapes were stopped on roads, north,
south, east and west, in cars not remotely like jeeps and some driving toward,
not away from, Las Vegas. None of them was Carmel either.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Among all the men wandering around
the Desert Door base and the city of Las Vegas with credentials from the U.S.
Public Health Service, one who really was employed by USPHS, had a long lean
body, a mournful countenance, a general resemblance to the late great Boris
Karloff, and the name Fred Filiarisus. By special authority of the White House,
Dr. Filiarisus was able to gain access to everything known by the scientists at
Desert Door, including the course of the disease in those originally infected,
among whom two had died before the antidote took effect and three had shown a
total lack of symptoms even though exposed along with the others. He also had
access to both FBI and CIA information as it came in, without having to bug
either office. It was he, therefore, who finally put together the correct
picture, on April 30, and reported directly to the White House at eleven that
morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Some people are naturally
immune to Anthrax Leprosy Pi, Mr. President,&quot; Filiarisus said.
&quot;Unfortunately, they serve as carriers. We found three like that at the
base, and it is mathematically, scientifically certain that a fourth is still at
large.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Everybody was lying to the FBI
and CIA, sir. They were all afraid of punishment for various activities
forbidden by our laws. No variation or permutation on their stories will hang
together reasonably. Each witness lied about something, and usually about
several things. The truth is other than it appeared. In short, the government,
being an agency of punishment, acted as a distorting factor from the beginning,
and I had to use information-theory equations to determine the degree of
distortion present. I would say that what I finally discovered may have
universal application: no governing body can ever obtain an accurate account of
reality from those over whom it holds power. From the perspective of
communication analysis, government is not an instrument of law and order, but of
law and disorder. I'm sorry to have to say this so bluntly, but it needs to be
kept in mind when similar situations arise in the future.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;He sounds like an <i>effing </i>anarchist,&quot;
the Vice President muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The true picture, with a
ninety-seven percent probability, is this,&quot; Filiarisus continued. &quot;Dr.
Mocenigo had only one contact, and she died. The FBI hypothesis is correct: her
body was then hidden, probably in the desert, by an associate wishing to avoid
involvement with law enforcement agencies. If prostitution were legal, we might
never have had this nightmare.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I told you he was an <i>effing </i>anarchist,&quot;
the Vice President growled. &quot;And a sex maniac, too!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The associate who hid the
body,&quot; Filiarisus went on, &quot;is our fourth carrier, personally immune
but lethal to others. It was this person who infected Mr. Chaney and Dr.
Naismith. This person was probably not a prostitute. These men lied, among other
reasons, because they knew what the government agents wanted them to say. When
power is wielded over people, they <i>say </i>as well as <i>do </i>what they
think is expected of them—another reason government always finds it difficult
to learn the truth about anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The only hypothesis that
mathematical logic will accept, when all the known data was fed into a computer,
is that the fourth carrier is the procurer who disappeared, Mr. Carmel.
Experiencing no symptoms himself, he is unaware that he carries the world's most
dangerous disease. For reasons of his own, which we cannot guess, he has been
hiding since he disposed of the woman's body. Probably, he feared that the
corpse might be found and a case of manslaughter or homicide could be made
against him. Or he might have a motive completely unrelated to her death. Only
twice has he contacted other human beings. I would suggest that his contact with
Miss Quint was typical of their</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">professional relationship; he either
hit her or had sex relations with her. His contact with Dr. Naismith and Mr.
Chaney was some sort of accident—perhaps the crowded elevator that has been
suggested by Mr. Despond. Otherwise, he had been, as it were, underground.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;This is why we only found three
cases instead of the thousands or millions we feared.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;However, the problem still
remains. Carmel is immune, will never know he has the disease unless he is told
it, and will eventually surface somewhere. When he does, we will learn of it
through the outbreak of Anthrax Leprosy Pi cases in the vicinity. At that point,
the whole nightmare begins again, sir.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Our best hope, and the computer
backs me on this, is public disclosure. The panic we tried to avoid will have to
be faced. Every medium of communication <i>in </i>the nation must be given the
full facts, and Carmels description must be circulated everywhere. This is our
last chance. The man is a walking biological Doomsday Machine and he must be
found.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Psychologists and social
psychologists have fed all the relevant facts about this case, and about
previous panics and plagues, into the computer also. The conclusion, with
ninety-three percent certainty, is that the panic will be nationwide and martial
law will have to be declared everywhere. Liberals in Congress should be placed
under house arrest as the first step, and the Supreme Court must be stripped of
its powers totally. The Army and the National Guard will have to be sent into
every city with authority to override any policies of local officials.
Democracy, in short, must cease until the emergency is ended.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;He's not an anarchist,&quot;
the Secretary of the Interior said. &quot;He's a goddam fascist.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;He's a realist,&quot; said the
President, clear-minded, crisp, quick on the uptake and stoned clear round the
corner of schizophrenia by his usual three tranquilizers, a stronger dose of
amphetamines than usual, and loads of those happy little Demerol tablets.
&quot;We start imple</span>menting his suggestions right now.&quot;</p>
<p>And so those few tattered remnants of the Bill of Rights which had survived
into the fourth decade of the Cold War were laid to rest—temporarily, it was
thought by those present. Dr. Filiarisus, whose name in the Ancient Illuminated
Seers of Bavaria was Gracchus Gruad, had completed on the day known as May Eve
or <i>Walpurgisnacht </i>the project begun when the first dream of Anthrax
Leprosy Pi was planted in Dr. Mocenigo's mind on the day known as Candelmas.
These dates were known by much older names in the Illuminati, of course, and the
burial of the Bill of Rights was expected, by them, to be permanent.</p>
<p>(Two hours before Dr. Filiarisus spoke to the President, four of the world's
five Illuminati Primi met in an old graveyard in Ingolstadt; the fifth could not
be present. They agreed that all was going as scheduled, but one danger
remained: nobody in the order, however developed his or her ESP, had been able
to trace Carmel. Leaning on a tombstone—where Adam Weishaupt had once
performed rites so unique that the psychic vibration had bounced off every
sensitive mind in Europe, leading to such decidedly peculiar literary
productions as Lewis's <i>The Monk, </i>Maturin's <i>Melmoth, </i>Walpole's <i>Castle
of Otranto, </i>Mrs. Shelley's <i>Frankenstein, </i>and DeSade's <i>One Hundred
Twenty Days oi Sodom—</i>the eldest of the four said, &quot;It can still fail,
if one of the mehums finds the pimp before he infects a city or two.&quot;
Mehums was an abbreviation for all descendants of those not part of the original
Unbroken Circle; it meant <i>mere humans.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Why can none of our ultra-sensitives find him?&quot; a second asked.
&quot;Does he have no ego or soul at all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He has a vibration but it's not distinctly human. Whenever we seem to
have a fix on it, we're usually ' picking up a bank vault or the safe of some
paranoid millionaire,&quot; the eldest replied.</p>
<p>&quot;We have that problem with an increasing number of Americans,&quot; the
third commented morosely. &quot;In that nation, we have done our work too well.
The con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">ditioning to those pieces of
paper is so strong that no other psychic impulse remains to be read.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The fourth spoke. &quot;Now is no
time for trepidation, my brothers. The plan is virtually realized, and this
man's lack of ordinary mehum qualities will prove an advantage when we do fix on
him. No ego, no resistance. We will be able to move him at our whim. The stars
are right, He Who Is Not To Be Named is impatient, and now we must be
intrepid!&quot; She spoke with fervor.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The others nodded. <i>&quot;Heute die
Welt, Morgens das Sonnensystem!&quot; </i>the eldest cried out fiercely.</span></p>
<p><i>&quot;Heute die Welt&quot; </i>all repeated, <i>&quot;Morgens das
Sonnensystem!&quot;)</i></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But two days earlier, as the <i>Leif
Erikson </i>left the Atlantic and entered the underground Ocean of Valusia
beneath Europe, George Dorn was listening to a different kind of chorus. It was,
Mavis had explained to him in advance, the weekly Agape Ludens, or Love Feast
Game, of the Discordians, and the dining hall was newly bedecked with
pornographic and psychedelic posters, Christian and Buddhist and Amerindian
mystic designs, balloons and lollypops dangling from the ceiling on
Day-Glo-dabbed strings, numinous paintings of Discordian saints (including
Norton I, Sigismundo Malatesta, Guillaume of Aquitaine, Chuang Chou, Judge Roy
Bean, various historical figures even more obscure, and numerous gorillas and
dolphins), bouquets of roses and forsythia and gladiolas and orchids, clusters
of acorns and gourds, and the inevitable proliferation of golden apples,
pentagons and octopi.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The main course was the best Alaskan
king crab Newburg that George had ever tasted, only lightly dusted with a mild
hint of Panamanian Red grass. Dozens of trays of dried fruits and cheeses were
passed back and forth among the tables, together with canapes of an exquisite
caviar George had never encountered before (&quot;Only Hagbard knows where those
sturgeon spawn,&quot; Mavis explained) and the beverage was a blend of the
Japanese seventeen-herb Mu tea with Menomenee Indian peyote tea. While everyone
gorged, laughed and got gently but definitely zonked, Hag-bard—who was
evidently satisfied that he and FUCKUP had located &quot;the problem in Las
Vegas&quot;—merrily conducted the religious portion of the Agape Ludens.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Rub-a-dub-dub,&quot; he
chanted, &quot;O hail Eris!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Rub-a-dub-dub,&quot; the crew
merrily chorused, &quot;O Hail Eris!&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sya-dasti,&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard
chanted. &quot;All that I tell you is true.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sya-dasti,&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">the
crew repeated, &quot;O hail Eris!&quot; George looked around; there were three,
or five, races present (depending upon which school of physical anthropology you
credited) and maybe half a hundred nationalities, but the feeling of brotherhood
and sisterhood transcended any sense of contrast, creating instead a blend, as
in musical progression.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sya-davak-tavya,&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard
chanted now. &quot;All that I tell you is false.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sya-davak-tavya,&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George
joined in, &quot;O hail Eris!&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sya-dasti-sya-nasti,&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard
intoned. &quot;All that I tell you is meaningless.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sya-dasti-sya-nasti,&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">all
agreed, some jeeringly, &quot;O hail Eris!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">If they had services like this in the
Baptist church back in Nutley, George thought, I never would have told my mother
religion is all a con and had that terrible quarrel when I was nine.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sya-dasti-sya-nasti-sya-davak-tav-yaska,&quot;
</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard sang out. &quot;All
that I tell you is true and false and meaningless.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sya-dasti-sya-nasti-sya-davak-tav-yaska,&quot;
</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">the massed voices replied,
&quot;O hail Eris!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Rub-a-dub-dub,&quot; Hagbard
repeated quietly. &quot;Does anyone have a new incantation?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;All hail crab Newburg,&quot; a
Russian-accented voice shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That was an immediate hit. &quot;All
hail crab New-burg,&quot; everyone howled.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;All hail these bloody fucking
beautiful roses,&quot; an</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Oxfordian voice contributed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;All hail these bloody fucking
beautiful roses,&quot; all agreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Miss Mao arose. &quot;The Pope is the
chief cause of Protestantism,&quot; she recited softly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That was another roaring success;
everybody chorused, and one Harlem voice added, &quot;Right <i>on!&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Capitalism is the chief cause
of socialism,&quot; Miss Mao chanted, more confident. That went over well, too,
and she then tried, &quot;The State is the chief cause of anarchism,&quot; which
was another smashing success.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Prisons are built with the
stones of law, brothels with the bricks of religion,&quot; Miss Mao went on.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;PRISONS ARE BUILT WITH THE
STONES OF LAW, BROTHELS WITH THE BRICKS OF RELIGION,&quot; the hall boomed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I stole that last one from
William Blake,&quot; Miss Mao said quietly and sat down.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Any others?&quot; Hagbard
asked. There was none, so he went on after a moment, &quot;Very well, then, I
will preach my weekly sermon.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Balls!&quot; cried a Texas
voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Bullshit!&quot; added a
Brazilian female.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard frowned. &quot;That wasn't
much of a demonstration,&quot; he commented sadly. &quot;Are the rest of you so
passive that you're just going to sit here on your dead asses and let me bore
the piss out of you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The Texan, the Brazilian lady and a
few others got up. &quot;We are going to have an orgy,&quot; the Brazilian said
briefly, and they left.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Well, sink me, I'm glad there's
some life left on this old tub,&quot; Hagbard grinned. &quot;As for the rest of
you— who can tell me, without uttering a word, the fallacy of the
Illuminati?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A young girl—she was no more than
fifteen, George guessed, and the youngest member of the crew; he had heard she
was a runaway from a fabulously rich Italian family in Rome—slowly raised her
hand and clenched her fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard turned on her furiously.
&quot;How many times must I tell you people: no faking! You got that out of some
cheap book on Zen that neither the author nor you understood a damned word of. I
hate to be dictatorial, but phony mysticism is the one thing Discordianism can't
survive. You're on shitwork, in the kitchen, for a week, you wise-ass
brat.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The girl remained immobile, in the
same position, fist raised, and only slowly did George read the slight smile
that curled her mouth. Then he started to smile himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hagbard lowered his eyes for a second
and gave a Sicilian shrug. <i>&quot;O oi che siete in picdoletta barca,&quot; </i>he
said softly, and bowed. &quot;I'm still in charge of nautical and technical
matters,&quot; he announced, &quot;but Miss Portinari now succeeds me as <i>episkopos
</i>of the <i>Leif Erikson </i>cabal. Anyone with lingering spiritual or
psychological problems, take them to her.&quot; He lunged across the room,
hugged the girl, laughed with her happily for a moment and placed his golden
apple ring on her finger. &quot;Now I don't have to meditate every day,&quot; he
shouted joyously, &quot;and I'll have more time for some thinking.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In the next two days, as the <i>Leif
Erikson </i>slowly crossed the Sea of Valusia and approached the Danube, George
discovered that Hagbard had, indeed, put all his mystical trappings behind him.
He spoke only of technical matters concerning the submarine, or other mundane
subjects, and was sublimely unconcerned with the role-playing, role-changing and
other mind-blowing tactics that had previously made up his persona. What
emerged—the new Hagbard, or the old Hagbard of days before his adoption of
guru-hood— was a tough, pragmatic, middle-aged engineer, with wide
intelligence and interests, an overwhelming kindness and generosity, and many
small symptoms of nervousness, anxiety and overwork. But mostly he seemed happy,
and George realized that the euphoria derived from his having dropped an
enormous burden.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Miss Portinari, meanwhile, had lost
the self-effacing quality that made her so eminently forgettable before,</span></p>
<p>and, from the moment Hagbard passed her the ring, she was as remote and
gnomic as an Etruscan sybil. George, in fact, found that he was a little afraid
of her—an annoying sensation, since he thought he had transcended fear when he
found that the Robot was, left to itself, neither cowardly nor homicidal.</p>
<p>George tried to discuss his feelings with Hagbard once, when they happened to
be seated together at dinner on April 28. &quot;I don't know where my- head is
at anymore,&quot; he said tentatively.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, in the immortal words of Marx, putta your hat on your neck,
then,&quot; Hagbard grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;No, seriously,&quot; George murmured as Hagbard hacked at a steak.
&quot;I don't feel really awakened or enlightened or whatever. I feel like K. in
<i>The Castle: </i>I've seen it once, but I don't know how to get back
there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you <i>want </i>to get back?&quot; Hagbard asked. &quot;I'm
damned glad to be out of it all. It's harder work than coal mining.&quot; He
munched placidly, obviously bored by the direction of the conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;That's not true,&quot; George protested. &quot;Part of you is still
there, and always will be. You've just given up being a guide for others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm <i>trying </i>to give up,&quot; Hagbard said pointedly. &quot;Some
people seem to be trying to reenlist me. Sorry. I'm not a German shepherd or a
draftee. <i>Non serviam, </i>George.&quot;</p>
<p>George fiddled with his own steak for a minute, then tried another approach.
&quot;What was that Italian phrase you used, just before you gave your ring to
Miss Por-tinari?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't think of anything else to say,&quot; Hagbard explained,
embarrassed. &quot;So, as usual with me, I got arty and pretentious. Dante
addresses his readers, in the First Canto of the <i>Paradiso, 'O voi che siete
in pic-cloletta barca'—</i>roughly, Oh, you who are sailing in a very small
boat astern of me. He meant that the readers, not having had the Vision,
couldn't really understand his words. I turned it around, <i>'O oi che siete in
piccioletta barca,' </i>admitting I was behind her in under<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">standing.
I should get the Ezra Pound Award for hiding emotion in tangled erudition.
That's why I'm glad to give up the guru gig. I never was much better than;
second-rate at it.&quot; j</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Well, I'm still way astern of <i>you
. . </i>.&quot; George began.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Look,&quot; Hagbard growled.
&quot;I'm a tired engineer at the end of a long day. Can't we talk about
something less taxing to my depleted brain? What do you think of the economic
system I outline in the second part of <i>Never Whistle While You're Pissing? </i>I've
decided to<sup> </sup>start calling it techno-anarchism; do you think that's
more clear at first sight than anarcho-capitalism?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And George found himself, frustrated,
engaged in a long discussion of non-interest-bearing currencies, land
stewardship replacing land ownership, the inability of monopoly capitalism to
adjust to abundance, and other, matters which would have interested him a week
ago but now were very unimportant compared to the question which Zen masters
phrased as &quot;getting the goose out of the bottle without breaking the
glass&quot;—or specifically, getting George Dorn out of &quot;George
Dorn&quot; without destroying GEORGE DORN.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That night, Mavis came again to his
bed, and George said again, &quot;No. Not until you love me the way I love
you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You're turning into a
stiff-necked prig,&quot; Mavis said. &quot;Don't try to walk before you can
crawl.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Listen,&quot; George cried.
&quot;Suppose our society crippled every infant's legs systematically, instead
of our minds? The ones who tried to get up and walk would be called neurotics,
right? And the awkwardness of their first efforts would be published in the all
psychiatric journals as proof of the regressive and schizzy nature of their
unsocial and unnatural impulse toward walking, right? And those of you who know
the secret would be superior and aloof and tell us to wait, be patient, you'll
let us in on it in your own good time, right? Crap. I'm going to do it on my
own.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm not holding anything
back,&quot; Mavis said gently.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;There's no field until <i>both </i>poles
are charged.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And I'm the dead pole? Go to
hell and bake bagels.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">After Mavis left, Stella arrived,
wearing cute Chinese pajamas. &quot;Horny?&quot; she asked bluntly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Christ Almighty, yes!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In ninety seconds they were naked and
he was nibbling at her ear while his hand rubbed her pubic mat; but a saboteur
was at work at his brain. &quot;I love you,&quot; he thought, and it was not
untrue because he loved all women now, knowing partially what sex was really all
about, but he couldn't bring himself to say it because it was not totally true,
either, since he loved Mavis more, much more. &quot;I'm awfully fond of
you,&quot; he almost said, but the absurdity of it stopped him. Her hand cupped
his cock and found it limp; her eyes opened and looked into his enquiringly. He
kissed her lips quickly and moved his hand lower, inserting a ringer until he
found the clitoris. But even when her breathing got deeper, he did not respond
as usual, and her hand began massaging his cock more desperately. He slid down,
kissing nipples and bellybutton on the way, and began licking her clitoris. As
soon as she came, he cupped her buttocks, lifted her pelvis, got his tongue into
her vagina and forced another quick orgasm, immediately lowering her slightly
again and beginning a very gentle and slow return in spiral fashion back to the
clitoris. But still he was flaccid.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Stop,&quot; Stella breathed.
&quot;Let me do you, baby.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George moved upward on the bed and
hugged her. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said, and suddenly it did not sound like
a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Stella giggled and kissed his mouth
briefly. &quot;It takes a lot to get those words out of you, doesn't it?&quot;
she said bemusedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Honesty is the worst
policy,&quot; George said grimly. &quot;I was a child prodigy, you know? A
freak. It was rugged. I had to have some defense, and somehow I picked honesty.
I was always with older boys so I never won a fight. The only way I could feel
superior, or escape total inferiority, was to be the most honest bastard on the
planet earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;So you can't say 'I love you'
unless you mean it?&quot; Stella laughed. &quot;You're probably the only man in
America with <i>that </i>problem. If you could only be a woman for a while,
baby! You can't imagine what liars most men are.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, I've said it at times. When
it was at least half true. But it always sounded like play-acting to me, and I
felt it sounded that way to the woman, too. This time it just came out,
perfectly natural, no effort.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That <i>is </i>something,&quot;
Stella grinned. &quot;And I can't let it go unrewarded.&quot; Her black body
slid downward and he enjoyed the esthetic effect as his eyes followed
her—black on white, like the <i>yin-yang </i>or the Sacred Chao—what was the
psychoses of the white race that made this beauty seem ugly to most of them?
Then her lips closed over his penis and he found that the words had loosened the
knot: he was erect in a second. He closed his eyes to savor the sensation, then
opened them to look down at her Afro hairdo, her serious dark face, his cock
slipping back and forth between her lips. &quot;I love you,&quot; he repeated,
with even more conviction. &quot;Oh, Christ, Oh, Eris, oh baby baby, I love
you!&quot; He closed his eyes again, and let the Robot move his pelvis in
response to her. &quot;Oh, stop,&quot; he said, &quot;stop,&quot; drawing her
upward and turning her over, &quot;together,&quot; he said, mounting her,
&quot;together,&quot; as her eyes closed when he entered her and then opened
again for a moment meeting his in total tenderness, &quot;I love you, Stella, I
love,&quot; and he knew it was so far along that the weight wouldn't bother her,
collapsing, using his arms to hug her, not supporting himself, belly to belly
and breast to breast, her arms hugging him also and her voice saying, &quot;I
love you, too, oh, I love you,&quot; and moving with it, saying
&quot;angel&quot; and &quot;darling&quot; and then saying nothing, the explosion
and the light again permeating his whole body not just the penis, a passing
through the mandala to the other side and a long sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The next morning, he and Stella
fucked some more, wildly and joyously; they said &quot;I love you&quot; so many
times that it became a new mantra to him, and they were still whispering at
breakfast. The problem of Mavis and the problem of reaching total enlightenment
had both vanished from his mind. Enjoying bacon and eggs that seemed tastier
than he had ever eaten before, exchanging pointless and very private jokes with
Stella, George Dorn was at peace.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(But nine hours earlier, at that
&quot;same&quot; time, the Kachinas gathered in the center of the oldest city in
North America, Orabi, and began a dance which an excited visiting anthropologist
had never seen before. As he questioned various old men' and old women among the
People of Peace—which is what <i>ho-pi </i>means—he found that the dance was
dedicated to She-Woman-Forever-Not-Change. He knew enough not to try to convert
that title into his own grammar, since it represented an important aspect of the
Hopi philosophy of Time, which is much like the Simon Moon and Adam Weishaupt
philosophies of Time and nothing like what physics students learn, at least
until they reach graduate level studies. Only four times, he was told, had this
dance ever been necessary: four times when the many worlds were all in danger,
and this was the time of the fifth and greatest danger. The anthropologist, who
happened to be a Hindu named Indole Ringh, quickly jotted in his notebook:
&quot;Cf. four yugas in <i>Upanishads, </i>Wagadu legend in Sudan, and Marsh's
queer notions about Atlantis. This could be big.&quot; The dance went on, the
drums pounded monotonously, and Carmel, far away, broke into a sudden
perspiration . . .)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And, in Los Angeles, John
Dillinger calmly loaded his revolver, dropped it in his briefcase and set a
Panama hat on his neatly combed silver-gray hair. </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He
was humming a song from his youth: &quot;Those wedding bells are breaking up
that old gang of mine ...&quot; I hope that pimp is where Hagbard says, he
thought; I've only got eighteen hours before they declare martial law</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">. . . &quot;Good-bye forever,&quot;
he hummed on, &quot;old fellows and pals . . .&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I saw the fnords the same day I first
heard about the plastic martini. Let me be very clear and precise about this,
since many of the people on this trip are deliberately and perversely obscure: I
would not, <i>could not, </i>have seen the fnords if Hagbard Celine hadn't
hypnotized me the night before, on the flying saucer.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I had been reading Pat Walsh's memos,
at home, and listening to a new record from the Museum of Natural History. I was
adding a few new samples to my collection of Washington-Weishaupt pictures on
the wall, when the saucer appeared hovering outside my window. Needless to say,
it didn't particularly surprise me; I had saved a little of the AUM, after
Chicago, contrary to the instructions from ELF, and had dosed myself. After
meeting the Dealy Lama, not to mention Malaclypse the Elder, and seeing that nut
Celine actually talk to gorillas, I assumed my mind was a point of receptivity
where the AUM would trigger something truly original. The UFO, in fact, was a
bit of a letdown; so many people had seen them already, and I was ready for
something nobody had ever seen or imagined.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It was even more a disappointment
when they psyched me, or slurped me aboard, and I found, instead of Martians or
Insect Trust delegates from the Crab Galaxy, just Hagbard, Stella Maris and a
few other people from the <i>Leif Erikson.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hail Eris,&quot; said Hagbard.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;All hail Discordia,&quot; I
replied, giving the three-after-two pattern, and completing the pentad. &quot;Is
this something important, or did you just want to show me your latest
invention?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The inside of the saucer was, to be
trite, eerie. Everything was non-Euclidean and semitransparent; I kept feeling
that I might fall through the floor and hurtle to the ground to smash myself on
the sidewalk. Then we started moving and it got worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Don't let the architecture
disturb you,&quot; Hagbard</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">said. &quot;My own adaptation of some
of Bucky Fuller's synergetic geometry. It's smaller, and more solid, than it
looks. You won't fall out, believe me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Is this contraption behind all
the flying saucer reports since 1947?&quot; I asked curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Not quite,&quot; Hagbard
laughed. &quot;That's basically a hoax. The plan was created in the United
States government, one of the few ideas they've had without direct Illuminati
inspiration since about the middle of Roosevelt's first term. A reserve measure,
in case something happens to Russia and China.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hi, baby,&quot; I said softly
to Stella, remembering San Francisco. &quot;Would you tell me, minus the Celine
rhetoric and paradox, what the hell he's talking about?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The State is based on
threat,&quot; Stella said simply. &quot;If people aren't afraid of something,
they'll realize they don't need that big government hand picking their pockets
all the time. So, in case Russia and China collapse from internal dissension, or
get into a private war and blow each other to hell, or suffer some unexpected
natural calamity like a series of earthquakes, the saucer myth has been planted.
If there are no earthly enemies to frighten the American people with, the saucer
myth will immediately change. There will be 'evidence' that they come from Mars
and are planning to invade and enslave us. Dig?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;So,&quot; Hagbard added,
&quot;I built this little gizmo, and I can travel anywhere I want without
interference. Any sighting of this craft, whether by a radar operator with
twenty years' experience or a little old lady in Perth Amboy, is regarded by the
government as a case of autosuggestion—since they know they didn't plant it
themselves. I can hover over cities, like New York, or military installations
that are Top Secret, or any place I damned well please. Nice?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Very nice,&quot; I said.
&quot;But why did you bring me up here?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It's time for you to see the
fnords,&quot; he replied. Then I woke up in bed and it was the next morning. I
made breakfast in a pretty nasty mood, wondering if</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I'd seen the fnords, whatever the
hell they were, in the hours he had blacked out, or if I would see them as soon
as I went out in the street. I had some pretty gruesome ideas about them, I must
admit. Creatures with three eyes and tentacles, survivors from Atlantis, who
walked among us, invisible due to some form of mind shield, and did hideous work
for the Illuminati. It was unnerving to contemplate, and I finally gave in to my
fears and peeked out the window, thinking it might be better to see them from a
distance first.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Nothing. Just ordinary sleepy people,
heading for their buses and subways.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That calmed me a little, so I set out
the toast and coffee and fetched in the <i>New York Times </i>from the hallway.
I turned the radio to WBAI and caught some good Vivaldi, sat down, grabbed a
piece of toast and started skimming the first page.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Then I saw the fnords.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The feature story involved another of
the endless squabbles between Russia and the U.S. in the UN General Assembly,
and after each direct quote from the Russian delegate I read a quite distinct
&quot;Fnord!&quot; The second lead was about a debate in Congress on getting the
troops out of Costa Rica; every argument presented by Senator Bacon was followed
by another &quot;Fnord!&quot; At the bottom of the page was a <i>Times </i>depth-type
study of the growing pollution problem and the increasing use of gas masks among
New Yorkers; the most distressing chemical facts were interpolated with more
&quot;Fnords.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Suddenly I saw Hagbard's eyes burning
into me and heard his voice: &quot;Your heart will remain calm. Your adrenalin
gland will remain calm. Calm, all-over calm. You will not panic. You will look
at the fnord and see it. You will not evade it or black it out. You will stay
calm and face it.&quot; And further back, way back: my first-grade teacher
writing FNORD on the blackboard, while a wheel with a spiral design turned and
turned on his desk, turned and turned, and his voice droned on,</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">IF YOU DON'T SEE THE FNORD IT CAN'T EAT
YOU, DON'T</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">SEE THE FNORD, DON'T SEE THE FNORD . . .</span></b></p>
<p>I looked back at the paper and still saw the fnords.</p>
<p>This was one step beyond Pavlov, I realized. The first conditioned reflex was
to experience the panic reaction (the activation syndrome, it's technically
called) whenever encountering the word &quot;fnord.&quot; The second conditioned
reflex was to black out what happened, including the word itself, and just to
feel a general low-grade emergency without knowing why. And the third step, of
course, was to attribute this anxiety to the news stories, which were bad enough
in themselves anyway.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;
mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Of course, the essence of control is fear. The fnords
produced a whole population walking around in chronic low-grade emergency,
tormented by ulcers, dizzy spells, nightmares, heart palpitations and all the
other symptoms of too much adrenalin. All my left-wing arrogance and contempt
for my countrymen melted, and I felt genuine pity. No wonder the poor bastards
believe anything they're told, walk through pollution and overcrowding without
complaining, watch their sons hauled off to endless wars and butchered, never
protest, never fight back, never show much happiness or eroticism or curiosity
or normal human emotion, live with perpetual tunnel vision, walk past a slum
without seeing either the human misery it contains or the potential threat it
poses to their security . . . Then I got a hunch, and turned quickly to the
advertisements. It was as I expected: no fnords. That was part of the gimmick,
too: only in consumption, endless consumption, could they escape the amorphous
threat of the invisible fnords.</span>
<p>I kept thinking about it on my way to the office. If I pointed out a fnord to
somebody who hadn't been de-conditioned, as Hagbard deconditioned me, what would
he or she say? They'd probably read the word before or after it. &quot;No <i>this
</i>word,&quot; I'd say. And they would again read an adjacent word. But would
their panic level rise as the threat came closer to consciousness? I preferred
not to try the experiment; it might <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">have ended with a psychotic fugue in the subject. The conditioning,
after all, went back to grade school. No wonder we all hate those teachers so
much: we have a dim, masked memory of what they've done to us in converting us
into good and faithful servants for the Illuminati.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">When I arrived at my desk, Peter
Jackson handed me a press release. &quot;What do you make of this?&quot; he
asked with a puzzled frown, and I looked at the mimeographed first page. The old
eye-and-pyramid design leaped out at me. &quot;DeMolay Freres invites you to the
premiere debut of the world's first plastic nude martini . . . ,&quot; the press
release declared. On second glance the eye in the triangle turned into the
elliptical rim of a martini glass, while the pupil in the eye was actually the
olive floating in the cocktail.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What the hell is a plastic nude
martini?&quot; said Peter Jackson. &quot;And why would they invite us to a press
party for one?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You can bet that it's
nonbiodegradable,&quot; said Joe.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Which will make it very
unfashionable with honky ecology freaks,&quot; said Peter sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Joe squinted at the design again. It
could be a coincidence. But coincidence was just another word for synchronicity.
&quot;I think I'll go,&quot; he said. &quot;And what's that?&quot; he added as
his eye fell upon a half-unfolded poster on his desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, that came with the latest
American Medical Association album,&quot; said Peter. &quot;I don't want it, and
I thought you might. It's time you took those pictures of the Rolling Stones off
your wall. This is the age of constantly accelerating change, and a man who
displays old pictures of the Stones is liable to be labeled a reactionary.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Four owl-eyed faces stared at him.
They were dressed in one-piece white suits, and three of them were joining
extended hands to form a triangle, while the fourth, Wolfgang Saure, generally
acknowledged to be the leader of the group, stood with his arms folded in the
center. The picture was taken from above so that the most prominent elements
were the four heads, while the outstretched arms clearly made the sides of the
triangle, and the bodies seemed unimportant, dwindling away to nothing. The
background was jet black. The three young men and the woman, with their
smooth-shaven bony faces, their blond crew-cuts and their icy blue eyes seemed
extremely sinister to Joe. If the Nazis had won the war and Heinrich Himmler had
followed Hitler as ruler of the German Empire, kids like this would be running
the world. And they almost were, in a different sense, because they had
succeeded the Beatles and Stones as kings of music, which made them emperors
among youth. Although long hair remained the general fashion, the kids had
accepted the American Medical Association's antiseptic-clean appearance as a
needed reaction against a style that had become too commonplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">As Wolfgang himself had said,
&quot;If you need an outward sign to know your own, you don't really
belong.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;They give me the creeps,&quot;
said Joe.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What did you think when the
Beatles first came out?&quot; said Peter.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Joe shrugged. &quot;They gave me the
creeps. They looked ugly and sexless and like teenage werewolves with all that
hair. And they seemed to be able to mesmerize twelve-year-old girls.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Peter nodded. &quot;The bulk of the
AMA's fans are even younger. So you might as well start conditioning yourself to
them now. They're going to be around for a long time.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Peter, let's you and me have
lunch,&quot; Joe said. &quot;Then I'm going to get some work done, and then I'm
going to leave here at four to go to this plastic martini party. First of all,
though, hold the chair for me while I take down the Stones and put up the
American Medical Association.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The DeMolay Freres group wasn't
kidding, he found. There were martinis, olives and all (or cocktail onions for
those who preferred them) in transparent plastic bags that were shaped like nude
women. Pretty</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">terrible taste the manufacturer had,
thought Joe. Briefly, Joe wondered if it would be a good idea to infiltrate this
company so as to get dosages of AUM in all the plastic nude martinis. But then
he remembered the emblem and thought maybe this company was already infiltrated.
But by which side?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There was a beautiful Oriental girl
in the room. She had black hair that reached all the way down to the small of
her back, and when she raised her arms to adjust a head ornament, Joe was
surprised to see thick black hair in her armpits. Orientals did not normally
have much body hair, he thought. Could she be some relation to the hairy Ainu of
northern Japan? It intrigued him, turned him on as he'd never thought armpit
hair would, and he went over to her to talk. The first thing he noticed was that
the headband she wore had a golden apple with the letter K printed on it right
in the center of her forehead. She is one of Us, he thought. His hunch about
coming to this party was right.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;These martini bags sure have a
silly shape,&quot; said Joe.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Why? Don't you care for nude
women?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Well, this has about as much to
do with nude women as any other piece of plastic,&quot; said Joe. &quot;No, my
point is that it's in such execrable taste. But, then, all of American industry
is nothing but a giant obscene circus to me. What's your name?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The black eyes fixed his intently.
&quot;Mao Tsu-hsi.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Any relation?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No. My name means 'cat' in
Chinese. His doesn't. His name is <i>Mao </i>but mine is <i>Mao.&quot; </i>Joe
was enchanted by her enunciation of the two different tones.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Well, Miss Cat, You are the
most attractive woman I've met in ages.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">She responded with a silent
flirtation of her own and they were soon in a wonderfully interesting
conversation—which he could never remember afterwards. Nor did he notice the
pinch of powder she dropped into his drink. He began feeling strangely groggy.
Tsu-hsi took </span>his arm and led him to the checkroom. They got their coats,
left the building and hailed a cab. In the back seat they kissed for a long
time. She opened her coat and he pulled the zipper that went all the way down
the front of her dress. He felt her breasts and stroked her belly, then dropped
his head into her bush. She was wearing no underwear. She draped her legs over
his, using her coat to screen what was going on from the cab driver, and helped
him expose his erect penis. With a few quick, agile movements she had swept her
skirt out of the way, raised her little seat into the air and slid her
well-lubricated cunt down over his cock and was fucking him sidesaddle. It could
have been difficult and awkward, but she was so light and well coordinated that
she managed to bring herself to orgasm easily and voluptuously. She drew in her
breath sharply through her teeth and a shudder ran through her body. She rested
her head momentarily on his shoulder, then raised herself slightly and helped
Joe to a pleasant climax with a rotary motion of her ass.</p>
<p>The experience, Joe realized, would have been more exquisite a few months, or
a few years, earlier. Now, with his growing sensitivity, he was conscious of
what had been missing: the actual energetic contact. The effect of the JAMs and
the Discordians on him, he reflected, had been paradoxical by ordinary
standards. He was no more puritanical than before they started tinkering with
his nervous system (he was less), but at the same time casual sex was less
appealing to him. He remembered Atlanta Hope's diatribes against
&quot;sexism&quot; in her book <i>Telemachus Sneezed—</i>the Bible of the
God's Lightning Movement—and he suddenly saw some weird kind of sense in her
rantings. &quot;The Sexual Revolution in America was as much of a fraud as the
Political Revolutions in China and Russia,&quot; Atlanta had written with her
usual exuberant capitalization; she was, in a way, quite right. People today
were still wrapped in a cellophane of false ego, and even if they fucked and had
orgasms together the cellophane was still there and no real contact had been
made.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And yet if Mao was what he suspected
she would know this even better than he did. Was this quick, cool spasm some
kind of test or some lesson or demonstration? If so, how was he supposed to
respond?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And then he remembered that she had
not given an address to the driver. The cab had been waiting only for them to
take them to a predetermined place, for reasons unknown.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I've seen the fnords, </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">he
thought; <i>now I'm going to see more.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The cab stopped on a narrow, heavily
shadowed street that seemed to be all empty stores, factory buildings, loading
docks and warehouses.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">With Miss Mao leading, they entered
an old dilapidated-looking loft building with the aid of a key she had in her
handbag, climbed some clanging cast-iron stairs, walked hand in hand down a long
dark corridor and came at last through a series of anterooms, each better
appointed than the last, to a splendid boardroom. Joe shook his head, amazed at
what he saw, but there was something—he suspected a drug— that was keeping
him docile and passive.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Around a table sat men and women
costumed from various eras of human history. Joe recognized Indian, Chinese,
Japanese, Mongol and Polynesian dress, also classical Greek and Roman, medieval
and Renaissance. There were other outfits more difficult to recognize at first
glance. A flying Dutch board meeting, Joe thought to himself. They were talking
about the Illuminati, the Discordians, the JAMs and the Erisians.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A man wearing a steel breastplate and
helmet with gold inlay and a neatly trimmed mustache and goatee said, &quot;It
is now possible to predict with ninety-eight percent probability of accuracy
that the Illuminati are setting up Fernando Poo for an international crisis. The
question is, do we raid the island and get the records now, making sure they're
not endangered, or do we wait and take advantage of the trouble as a cover for
our raid?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A man in a dragon-embroidered red
silk robe said,</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;There will be no way to take
advantage of the trouble, in my opinion. It will seem like chaos on the surface,
but underneath the Illuminati will have everything very much under control. Now
is the time to move.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A woman in a translucent silk blouse
whose little vest did not hide her dark, rounded breasts, said, &quot;You
realize this could be a lovely scoop for your magazine, Mr. Malik. You could
send a reporter there to look into conditions on Fernando Poo. Equatorial Guinea
has all the usual problems of a developing African nation. Will tribal rivalries
flare up between the Bubi and the Fang, preventing the further development of
national cooperation? Will the poverty of the mainland province lead to attempts
to expropriate the wealth of Fernando Poo? And what of the army? What, for
example, of a certain Captain Jesus Tequila y Mota? An interview with the
captain might prove to be a journalistic coup three years from now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes,&quot; said a big woman in
colorfully dyed furs who played incessantly with the carved leg bone of some
large animal. &quot;We don't expect C. L. Sulzberger to grasp the importance of
Fernando Poo until the crisis is upon the world. So, if advance warning is
desirable—as we think it is—why not through <i>Confrontation?&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Is that why you asked me
here?&quot; said Joe. &quot;To tell me something is going to happen in Fernando
Poo? Where the hell is Fernando Poo, anyway?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Look it up in an atlas when you
get back to work. It's one of several volcanic islands off the coast of
Africa,&quot; said a dark-skinned, slit-eyed man wearing a buffalo hide
decorated with feathers. &quot;Of course, you understand that you could only
hint at the real forces at work there,&quot; he added. &quot;For instance, we
wouldn't want you to mention that Fernando Poo is one of the last outcroppings
of the continent of Atlantis, you know.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mao Tsu-hsi was standing beside Joe
with a glass containing a pinkish liquid. &quot;Here, drink this,&quot; she
said. &quot;It will sharpen your perceptions.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A man in gold-braid-encrusted field
marshal's uniform said, &quot;Mr. Malik is the next business in order on our
agenda. We are to educate him, to some extent Let's do it, to that extent.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The lights in the room went out.
There was a rustling at one end, and suddenly Joe was looking at a brightly lit
movie screen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:13.5pt">WHEN ATLANTIS RULED THE EARTH</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The title appears in letters that
look like blocks of stone piled on top of one another to form a kind of step
pyramid. It is followed by shots of the earth as it looked thirty thousand years
ago, during the great ice ages, showing woolly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers
and Cro-Magnon hunters, while a narrator explains that at the same time the
greatest civilization ever known by man is flourishing on the continent of
Atlantis. The Atlanteans do not know anything about good or evil, the narrator
explains. However, they all live to be five hundred years old and have no fear
of death. The bodies of all Atlanteans are covered with fur, as with apes.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">After seeing various domestic scenes
in Zukong Gi-morlad-Siragosa, the largest and most central city on the continent
(but not the capital, because the Atlanteans do not have a government), we move
to a laboratory where the young (one hundred years old) scientist GRUAD is
displaying a biological experiment to an associate, GAO TWONE. The experiment is
a giant water-dwelling serpent-man. Gao Twone is impressed, but Gruad declares
that he is bored; he wishes to change himself in some unexpected way. Gruad is
already strange—unlike other Atlanteans, he is not covered with fur, but has
only short blond hair on top of his head and a close-cropped beard. In
comparison to other Atlanteans he seems hideously naked. He wears a
high-collared pale green robe and gauntlets. He tells Gao Twone that he is tired
of accumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge. &quot;It's just another
guise for</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">the pursuit of pleasure, to which too
many of our fellow Atlanteans devote their lives. Of course, there's nothing
wrong with pleasure—it moves the energies— but I feel that there is
something higher and more heroic. I have no name for it yet, but I know it
exists.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Gao Twone is somewhat shocked.
&quot;You, as a scientist, can talk of <i>knowing </i>something exists when you
have no evidence?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Gruad is dejected by this and admits,
&quot;My lens needs polishing.&quot; But after a moment he bounces back.
&quot;And yet, even though I have my moments of doubt, I think my lens really is
clear. Of course, I must find lie evidence. But even now, before I start, I feel
that I know what I will find. We could be greater and finer than we are. I look
at what I am and sometimes I despise myself. I'm just a clever animal. An ape
who has learned to play with tools. I want to be much more. I say we can be what
the lloigor are, and even more. We can conquer time and seize eternity, even as
they have. I mean to achieve that or destroy myself in the attempt.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The scene shifts to a banquet hall
where INGEL RILD, a venerable Atlantean scientist, has called together prominent
Atlanteans to celebrate a space research achievement, the production of a solar
flare. Ingel Rild and his associates have developed a missile which, when it
strikes the sun, can cause an explosion. He tells the marijuana-smoking
gathering, &quot;We can control to the second the timing of the flare and to the
millimeter the distance it will spring out from the sun. A flare of sufficient
magnitude could burn our planet to a crisp. A smaller flare could bombard the
earth with radiations such that the area closest to the sun would be destroyed,
while the rest of our world would suffer drastic changes. Most serious of all,
perhaps, would be the biological changes these excessive radiations would bring
about. Life forms would be damaged and perhaps become extinct. New life forms
would arise. All of nature would undergo a tremendous upheaval. This has
happened naturally once or twice. It happened seventy million years ago when the
dinosaurs were suddenly wiped out and replaced by mammals. We still have much to
learn about the mechanism that produces spontaneous solar flares. However, to be
able to cause them artificially is a step toward predicting and possibly
controlling them. When that stage is reached, our planet and our race will be
protected from the kind of catastrophe that destroyed the dinosaurs.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">After the applause, a woman named
KAJECI asks whether it might not be disrespectful to tamper with &quot;our
father, the sun.&quot; Ingel Rild replies that man is a part of nature and what
he does is natural and can't be construed as tampering. Now Gruad interrupts
angrily, pointing out that he, an unattractive mutation, is the product of
tampering with nature. He tells Ingel Rild that the Atlanteans do not truly
understand nature and the order that controls it. He declares that man is
subject to laws. All things in nature are, but man is different because he can
disobey the natural laws that govern him. Gruad goes on, &quot;With humanity we
can speak, as we speak of our own machines, in terms of performance expected and
performance delivered. If a machine does not do what it is designed for, we try
to correct it. We want it to do what it <i>ought </i>to do, what it <i>should </i>do.
I think we have the right and the duty to demand the same of people—that they
perform as they <i>ought </i>to and <i>should </i>perform.&quot; An aged and
merry-eyed scientist named LHUV KERAPHT interrupts, &quot;But people are not
machines, Gruad.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Exactly,&quot; Gruad answers.
&quot;I have already considered that. Therefore, I have created new words, words
even stronger than <i>should </i>and <i>ought. </i>When a person performs as he
or she should and ought, I call that <i>Good; </i>and anything less than this I
call <i>Evil.&quot; </i>This outlandish notion is greeted with general laughter.
Gruad tries to speak persuasively, conscious of his lonely position as a
pioneer, trying desperately to communicate with the closed minds all around him.
After further argument, though, he becomes threatening, declaring, &quot;The
people of Atlantis do not live according to the law. In their pride, they strike
the sun itself, and boast of it, as you have, Ingel Rild, this day. I say that
if Atlanteans do not live according to the law, a disaster will befall them. A
disaster that will shake the entire earth. You have been warned! Heed my
words!&quot; Gruad strides majestically out of the banquet hall, seizing his
cloak at the door and sweeping it about him as he leaves. Kajeci follows him and
tells him that she thinks she partly understands what he has been trying to say.
The laws he speaks of are like the wishes of parents, and, &quot;The great
bodies of the universe are our parents. Isn't that so?&quot; Gruad's naked hand
strokes Kajeci's furred cheek, and they go off into the darkness together.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Within six months Gruad has formed an
organization called the Party of Science. Their banner is an eye inside a
triangle which in turn is surrounded by a serpent with its tail in its mouth.
The Party of Science demands that Atlantis publish the natural laws Gruad has
discovered and make them binding on all with systems of reward and punishment to
enforce them. The word &quot;punishment&quot; is another addition to the
Atlantean vocabulary coined by Gruad. One of Gruad's opponents explains to
friends of his that it means torture, and everyone's fur bristles. Ingel Rild
announces to a gathering of his supporters that Gruad has proven to his own
satisfaction—and the demonstration runs to seventy-two scrolls of logical
symbols—that sex is part of what he calls Evil. Only sex for the good of the
community is to be permitted under Gruad's system, to keep the race alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A scientist called TON LIT exclaims,
&quot;You mean we must be thinking about conception during the act? That's
impossible. Men's penises would droop, and women's vaginas wouldn't get moist.
It's like—well, it's like making the shrill mouth-music while you are
urinating. It would take great training, if it can be done at all.&quot; Ingel
Rild proposes the formation of a Party of Freedom to oppose Gruad. Discussing
Gruad's personality, Ingel Rild says he checked the genealogical records and
found that several of the most agitated-energy people in all Atlantean history
were among his ancestors. Gruad is a mutation, and so are many of his followers.
The energy of normal Atlanteans flows slowly. Gruad's people are impatient and
frustrated, and this is what makes them want to inflict suffering on their
fellow humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Joe sat up with a jolt. If he
understood that part of the movie, Gruad—evidently the first Illuminatus—was
also the first <i>homo neophilus. </i>And the Party of Freedom, which seemed to
be the origin of the Discordian and JAM movements, was pure <i>homo neophobus. </i>How
the hell could that be squared with the generally reactionary attitude of
current Illuminati policies, and the innovativeness of the Discordians and JAMs?
But the film was moving on—</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In a disreputable-looking tavernlike
place where men and women smoke dope in pipes that they pass from one to
another, while people grope in couples and groups in dark corners, SYLVAN
MARTISET proposes a Party of Nothingness that rejects the positions of both the
Party of Science and the Party of Freedom.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">After this we see street fighting,
atrocities, the infliction of punishment on harmless people by men wearing
Gruad's eye-and-triangle badge. The Party of Freedom proclaims its own symbol, a
golden apple. The fighting spreads, the numbers of the dead mount and Ingel Rild
weeps. He and his associates decide on a desperate expedient—unleashing the
lloigor Yog Sothoth. They will offer this unnatural soul-eating energy being
from another universe its freedom in return for its help in destroying Gruad's
movement. Yog Sothoth is imprisoned in the great Pentagon of Atlantis on a
desolate moor in the southern part of the continent. The Atlantean electric
plane bearing Ingel Rild, Ton Lit and another scientist drifts, trailing
feathery sparks, to a landing in a flat field overgrown with gray weeds. Within
the Pentagon, an enormous black stone structure, the ground</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">is scorched and the air shimmers like
a heat mirage. Flickers of static electricity run through the shimmering from
time to time, and an unpleasant noise, like flies around a corpse, pervades the
whole moor. The faces of the three Atlantean sages register disgust, sickness
and terror. They climb the nearest tower and talk to the guard. Suddenly Yog
Sothoth takes control of Ton Lit, speaking in an oily, rich, deep and
reverberating voice, and asks them what they seek of him. Ton Lit lets out a
terrible shriek and claps his hands over his ears. Froth slips from the side of
his mouth, his fur bristles and his penis stands erect. His eyes are delirious
and suffering, like those of a dying gorilla. The guard uses an electronic
instrument that looks like a magician's wand topped with a five-pointed star to
subdue Yog Sothoth. Ton Lit bays like a hound and leaps for Ingel Rild's throat.
The electronic ray drives him back and he stands panting, tongue hanging loose,
as the Pentagon first and then the ground begin to soften into asymptotic
curves. Yog Sothoth chants, &quot;la-nggh-ha-nggh-ha-nggh-fthagn!
la-nggh-ha-nggh-ha-nggh-hgual! The blood is the life ... The blood is the life
...&quot; All faces, bodies and perspectives are skewed and there is a greenish
tinge on everything. Suddenly the guard strikes the nearest wall of the Pentagon
directly with his electronic wand and Ton Lit shrieks, human intelligence coming
back into his eyes together with great shame and revulsion. The three sages flee
the Pentagon under a sky slowly turning back to its normal shape and color. The
laughter of Yog Sothoth follows them. They decide that they cannot release the
lloigor.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Meanwhile Gruad has called his
closest followers, known as the Unbroken Circle of Gruad, to announce that
Kajeci has conceived. Then he shows them a group of manlike creatures with
green, scaly skin, wearing long black cloaks and black skullcaps with scarlet
plumes. These he calls his Ophidians. Since At-lanteans have a kind of
instinctive check on themselves that prevents them from killing except in blind
fury,</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Gruad
has developed these synthetic humanoids from the serpent, which he has found to
be the most intelligent of all reptiles. They will have no hesitation about
destroying men and will act only on Gruad's command. Some of his followers
protest, and Gruad explains that this is not really killing. He says,
&quot;Atlanteans who will not accept the teachings of the Party of Science are
swinish beings. They are a sort of robot who has no inner spiritual substance to
control it. Our bodies, however, are deceived into feeling as if they are our
own kind, and we cannot raise our hands against them. Now, however, the light of
science has given us hands to raise.&quot; At this meeting Gruad also addresses
his men for the first time as the &quot;illuminated ones.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">At the next meeting of the Party of
Freedom the Ophidians attack, using iron bars to club people to death and
slashing throats with their fangs. Then the Party of Freedom holds a funeral for
a dozen of its dead at which Ingel Rild gives an oration describing the ways in
which the struggle between Gruad's followers and the other Atlanteans is
changing the character of all human beings:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hitherto, Atlanteans have
enjoyed knowledge but not worried over the fact that there is much that we do
not know. We are conservative and indifferent to new ideas, we have no inner
conflicts and we feel like doing the things that seem wise to us. We think that
the things we feel like doing will usually work out for the best. We consider
pain and pleasure a single phenomenon, which we call sensation, and we respond
to unavoidable pain by relaxing or becoming ecstatic. We do not fear death. We
can read each other's minds because we are in touch with all the energies of our
bodies. The followers of Gruad have lost that ability, and they are thankful
that they have. The Scientists dote on new things and new ideas. This love of
the new thing is a matter of genetic manipulation. Gruad is even encouraging
people in their twenties to have children, though it is our custom never to have
children</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">before we reach a hundred. The
generations of Gruad's followers come thick and fast, and they are not like us.
They agonize over their ignorance. They are full of uncertainty and inner
conflict between what they should do and what they feel like doing. The
children, who are brought up on Gruad's teachings, are even more disturbed and
conflict-filled than their parents. One doctor tells me that the attitudes and
the way of life Gruad is encouraging in his people is enough to shorten their
life spans considerably. And they are afraid of pain. They are afraid of death.
And even as their lives grow shorter, they desperately seek for some means of
achieving immortality.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Gruad tells a meeting of his Unbroken
Circle that the tune has come to intensify the struggle. If they can't rule the
Atlanteans, they will destroy Atlantis. &quot;Atlantis will be destroyed by
light,&quot; says Gruad. &quot;By the light of the sun.&quot; Gruad introduces
the worship of the sun to his followers. He reveals the existence of gods and
goddesses. &quot;They are all energy, conscious energy,&quot; says Gruad.
&quot;This conscious and powerfully directed and focused pure energy I call
spirit. All motion is spirit. All light is spirit. All spirit is light.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Under Gruad's direction, the Party of
Science builds a great pyramid, thousands of feet high. It is in two halves; the
upper half, made of an indestructible ceramic substance and inscribed with a
terrible staring eye, floats five hundred feet above the base, held in place by

<p>Lilith Velkor addresses the Nothingarians, satirizing all Gruad's beliefs,
claiming that the most powerful god is a crazy woman and she is the goddess of
chaos. To the accompaniment of laughter she declares, &quot;Gruad says the sun
is the eye of the sun god. That's more of his notion that males are superior and
reason and order are superior. Actually, the sun is a giant golden apple which
is the plaything of the goddess of chaos. And it's the property of anyone she
thinks is fair enough to deserve it.&quot; Suddenly a band of Ophidians attacks
followers of Lilith Velkor and kills several of them. Lilith Velkor leads her
people in an unprecedented attack on the Ophidians. They storm up the side of
the great pyramid and throw the Ophidians down to the street, killing them.
Amazingly, they succeed in wiping out all the Ophidians. Gruad declares that
Lilith Velkor must die. When the opportunity presents itself, his men seize her
and take her to a dungeon. There an enormous wheel has been constructed with
four spokes in the shape</p>

<p>Lilith Velkor is crucified with ropes, upside down, on this device. Several
members of the Party of Science lounge about, watching her die. Gruad enters,
goes to the wheel and looks at the dying woman, who says, &quot;This is as good
a day to die as any.&quot; Gruad remonstrates with her, saying that death is a
great evil and she should fear it. She laughs and says, &quot;All my life I have
despised tradition and now I despise innovation also. Surely, I must be a most
wicked example for the world!&quot; She dies laughing. Gruad's rage is
unbearable. He vows that he will wait no longer; Atlantis is too wicked to save
and he will destroy it.</p>
<p>On a windswept plain in the northern regions of Atlantis a huge
teardrop-shaped rocket with graceful fins is poised on the launching pad. Gruad
is in the control room making last-minute adjustments while Kajeci and Wo Topod
argue with him. Gruad says, &quot;The human race will survive. It will survive
the better purged of these Atlanteans, who are nothing but swine, nothing but
robots, nothing but creatures who do not understand good and evil. Let them
perish.&quot; His finger strikes a red button and the rocket hurtles on its way
to the sun. It will take several days to reach there, and meanwhile Gruad has
gathered the Unbroken Circle on an airship which takes them away from Atlantis
and into the huge mountains to the east in a region that will one day be called
Tibet. Gruad calculates that by the time the missile strikes the sun, they will
have been landed and underground for two hours. The sun rides blinding yellow
over the plains of Atlantis. It is a beautiful day in Zukong Gimorlad-Siragosa,
the sun shining down on its slender, graceful towers with spiderweb bridges
spiraling among them, its parks, its temples, its museums, its fine public
buildings and magnificent private palaces. Its handsome, richly furred people
gracefully stride amidst the beauties of the first and finest civilization man
has ever produced. Families, lovers, friends and enemies, all unsuspecting what
is about to happen, enjoy their private moments. A quintet plays the melodious
zinthron, balatet, mordan, swaz and fen-drar. Over all, however, the great eye
on the side of Gruad's pyramid glares horrid and red.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sun's body rages. Coiled flames, balls of gas, roll out. The sun
looks like a giant fiery arachnid or octopus. One great flame comes rolling
toward the earth, burning red gas which turns yellow, then green, then blue,
then white.</p>
<p>There is nothing left of Zukong Gimorlad-Siragosa, except the pyramid with
its upper segment now resting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">on the
base, the antigravity generators having been destroyed. The baleful eye looks
out over an absolutely flat, burnt-black plain. The ground shakes, great cracks
open. The blackened area is a great circle, hundreds of miles in diameter,
beyond which is a dark brown and still desolate wasteland. Thousands of cracks
appear in the brittle surface of the continent, the strength of whose rocks has
been destroyed by the incredible heat of the solar flare. A tide of mud starts
crawling over the empty plain. It leaves only the top of the pyramid, with the
great eye, showing. Water sweeps over the mud, at first sinking in and standing
in pools, then rising higher so that only the tip of the pyramid sticks out of a
great lake. Under the water enormous parallel fissures open in the ground on
either side of the blackened central circle. The midsection of the continent,
including the pyramid, begins to sink. The pyramid falls into the depths of the
ocean with cliffs rising on either side of it to the parts of Atlantis that
still remain above the ocean. They will remain for many thousands of years more,
and they will be the Atlantis remembered in the legends of men. But the true
Atlantis—high Atlantis—is gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Gruad stares into his crimson-glowing
viewplate, watching the destruction of Atlantis. The light changes color, from
red to gray, and the face of Gruad turns gray. It is a terrible face. It has
aged a hundred years in the last few minutes. Gruad may claim to be in the
right, but deep down he knows that what he has done isn't nice. And yet deep
down there is satisfaction, too, for Gruad, long tortured by unreasonable guilt,
now has something he can really feel guilty about. He turns to the Unbroken
Circle and proposes, since it appears that the earth will survive the cataclysm
(he was not really sure that it would), that they plan for the future. Most of
them, however, are</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">still
in shock. Wo Topod,<sub>; </sub>inconsolable, stabs himself to death, the first
recorded time that a member of the human race has deliberately killed himself.
Gruad calls upon his followers to destroy all remains of the Atlantean
civilization and then, later, to build a perfect civilization when even the
ruins of Atlantis have been forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The great beasts that inhabited
Europe, Asia and North America die off as a result of mutations and diseases
caused by the solar flare. All relics of the Atlan-tean civilization are
destroyed. The people who were Gruad's erstwhile countrymen are either killed or
driven forth to wander the earth. Besides Gruad's Himalayan colony there is one
other remnant of the High Atlantean era: the Pyramid of the Eye, whose ceramic
substance resisted solar flare, earthquake, tidal wave and submersion in the
depths of the ocean. Gruad explains that it is right that the eye should remain.
It is the eye of God, the One, the scientific-technical eye of ordered knowledge
that looks down on the universe and by perceiving it causes it to be. If an
event is not witnessed, it does not happen; therefore, for the universe to
happen there must be a Witness.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Among the primitive hunters and
gatherers a mutation has appeared that seems to be spreading rapidly. More and
more people are being born without fur and with hair in the same pattern as
Gruad's. The Hour of God's Eye has caused mutations in every species.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">From the Himalayas the rocket ships
of the Unbroken Circle, painted red and white, swoop out in squadrons. They
sweep across Europe and land on the brown islands where Atlantis used to be.
There they land and raid a city of refugees from the Atlantean disaster. They
kill many of the leaders and intellectuals and herd the rest aboard the ships,
fly to the Americas and deposit the helpless people on a vast plain. Far below
their route of passage lies the Pyramid of the Eye at the bottom of the
Atlantic. The base of the pyramid is covered with silt and the break where the
upper part of the pyramid had floated on antigravity projectors is also covered.
Still the pyramid itself towers over the mud around it, taller by three times
than the Great Pyramid of Egypt, the building of which lies twenty-seven
thousand years in the future. A vast shadow descends upon the pyramid. There is
a suggestion in the darkness of the ocean bottom of giant tentacles, of sucker
disks wide as the rims of volcanos, of an eye as big as the sun looking at the
eye on the pyramid. Something touches the pyramid, and enormous as it is, it
moves slightly. Then the presence is gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The pentagonal trap in which the
people of Atlantis had heroically and brilliantly caught the dread ancient being
Yog Sothoth has been, amazingly, undamaged by the catastrophe. Being on the
southern plain, which was relatively uninhabited, the Pentagon of Yog Sothoth
becomes the center of a migration of people who survived the disaster. Emergency
cities are set up, those dying of radiation sickness are treated. A second
Atlantis begins to take root. And then, from the Himalayas, the ships of the
Unbroken Circle come swooping down on one of their raids. Lines of Atlantean men
and women are marched to the walls of the Pentagon and there mowed down by laser
fire. Then explosive charges are placed amid the heaps of bodies and the masked,
uniformed men of the Unbroken Circle withdraw. There is a series of explosions;
horrid yellow smoke goes coiling up. The gray stone walls crumble. There is a
moment of stillness, balance, tension. Then the piled-up boulders of one side of
the wall fly apart as if thrust by the hand of a giant. An enormous claw print
appears in the soft soil around the ruins of the Pentagon. The masked men of the
Unbroken Circle race frantically for their ships and take off. The ships dart
into the sky, stop suddenly, waver and plummet like stones to explosive crashes
on the earth. The surviving refugees scream and scatter. Like a scythe going
through wheat, death sweeps among them in great arcs as they run in massed mobs.
Mouths open in soundless screams, they fall. Only a handful escapes. Over the
scene a colossal reddish figure of indeterminate shape and number of limbs
stands triumphant.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In the Himalayas, Gruad and the
Unbroken Circle watch the destruction of the Pentagon and the massacre of the
Atlanteans. The Unbroken Circle cheers, but Gruad strangely weeps. &quot;You
think I hate walls?&quot; he says. &quot;I love walls. I love any kind of wall.
Anything that separates. Walls protect good people. Walls lock away the evil.
There must always be walls and the love of walls, and in the destruction of the
great Pentagon that held Yog Sothoth I read the destruction of all that I stand
for. Therefore I am stricken with regret.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">At this the face of EVOE, a young
priest, takes on a reddish glow and a demoniac look. There is more than a hint
of possession. &quot;It is good to hear you say that,&quot; he says to Gruad.
&quot;No man yet has befriended me, though many have tried to use me. I have
prepared a special place for your soul, oh first of the men of the future.&quot;
Gruad attempts to speak to Yog Sothoth, but the possession has apparently
passed, and the other members of the Unbroken Circle praise a new beverage that
Evoe has prepared, made of the fermented juice of grapes. At dinner, later that
day, Gruad tries the new beverage and praises it, saying, &quot;This juice of
grapes relaxes me and does not cause the disturbing visions and sounds that
makes the herb the Atlanteans used to smoke so unpleasant for a man of
conscience.&quot; Evoe gives him more to drink from a fresh jar, and Gruad takes
it. Before drinking he says, &quot;Any culture that arises in the next twenty
thousand years or so is going to have the rot of Atlantis in it. Therefore I
decree a noncultural time of eight hundred generations. After that we may allow
man free reign on his propensity for building civilizations. The culture he
builds will be under our guidance, with our ideas implicit in its every aspect,
with our control at every stage. Eight hundred generations from now the new
human culture will be planted. It will follow the natural law. It will have the
knowledge of good and evil, the light that comes from the sun, the sun that
blasphemers say is only an apple. It is no apple, I tell you, though it is a
fruit, even as this beverage of Evoe's that I now quaff is from a fruit. From
the grape comes this drink and from the sun comes the knowledge of good and
evil, the separation of light and darkness over the whole earth. Not an apple,
but the fruit of knowledge!&quot; Gruad drinks. He puts down his glass, clutches
his throat and staggers back. His other hand goes to his heart. He topples over
and lies on his back, his eyes staring upward.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Naturally, everyone accuses Evoe of
poisoning Gruad. But Evoe calmly answers that it was Lilith Velkor who did it.
He was doing research on the energies of the dead and had learned how to take
them into him. But sometimes the energies of the dead could take control of him,
so that he would be just a medium through which they act. He cries, &quot;When
you write this tragedy into the archives, you must say, not that Evoe the man
did it, but Evoe-Lilith, possessed by the evil spirit of a woman. The woman did
tempt me, I tell you! I was helpless.&quot; The Unbroken Circle is persuaded,
and agree that since Lilith Velkor and the crazy goddess she worshipped were
responsible for Gruad's death, henceforward women must be subordinate to men so
such evils will not be repeated. They decide to build a tomb for Gruad and to
inscribe upon it, &quot;The First Illuminated One: Never Trust A Woman.&quot;
They decide that since the lloigor is loose they will offer sacrifices to it,
and the sacrifices will be pure young women who have never lain with a man. Evoe
seems to be taking control of the group and Gao Twone protests this. To prove
his dedication to the true and the good, Evoe declares, he has had his penis
amputated as a sacrifice to the All-Seeing Eye. He pulls open his robe. All look
at his truncated crotch and immediately retch. Evoe goes on, &quot;Furthermor.e,
it is decreed by the Eye and Natural Law that all male children who would be
close to goodness and truth must imitate my sacrifice, at least to the extent of
losing the foreskin or being cut enough to bleed.&quot; Kajeci comes in at this
point, and they plan a great funeral, agreeing that they will not burn Gruad as
was the Atlantean custom, signifying that one is dead forever, but will preserve
his body, symbolizing the hope that he is not really dead but will rise again.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There follow several thousand years
of warfare between the remnants of the Atlanteans and the inhabitants of
Agharti, the stronghold of the Scientists, who now call themselves variously the
Knowledgeable or the Enlightened Ones. The last remnants of the Atlantean
culture are destroyed. Great cities were built, then destroyed by nuclear
explosions. All the inhabitants of the city of Peos are killed in one night by
the eater of souls. Chunks of the continent break off and sink into the sea.
There are earthquakes and tidal waves. Finally, only outcroppings like the
cone-shaped island of Fernando Poo rise alone from the sea where Atlantis had
been.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">About 13,000 B.C. a new culture is
planted on a hillside near the headwaters of the Euphrates and it starts to
spread. A tribe of Cro-Magnons, magnificently tall, strong, large-headed people,
is marched at gunpoint down from the snows of Europe to the fertile lands of the
Middle East. They are taken to the site chosen for the first agricultural
settlement and shown how to plant crops. For several years they do so while the
Unbroken Circle's men guard them with flame throwers. Their generations pass
rapidly, and once the new way of life has taken hold the Illuminated Ones leave
them alone. The tribe divides into kings, priests, scribes, warriors, and
farmers. A city surrounded by farms rises up. The kings and priests are soft,
weak and fat. The peasants are stunted and dulled by malnutrition. The warriors
are big and strong, but brutal and unintelligent. The scribes are intelligent,
but thin and bloodless. Now the city makes war on neighboring tribes of
barbarians. Being well organized and technologically superior, the people of the
city win. They enslave the barbarians and plant other cities nearby. Then a
great tribe of barbarians comes down from the north and conquers the civilized
people and burns their city. This is not the end of the new civilization,
though. It only revitalizes it. Soon the conquerors have learned to play the
roles of kings, priests and warriors, and now there is a kind of nation
consisting of several cities with a large body of armed who must be kept
occupied. Marching robotlike in great square formations, they set out over the
plain to find new peoples to conquer. The sun shines down on the civilization
created by the Illuminati. And below the sea the eye on the pyramid glares
balefully upward.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">THE END</span></b></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Lights flashed on suddenly. The
screen rolled up into its receptacle with a snap. Blinded, Joe rubbed his eyes.
He had a ferocious headache. He also had a ferocious need to urinate at once,
before his bladder exploded. He'd had an awful lot of drinks at the plastic
martini party, then made love to that Chinese girl in the cab, then sat down to
watch this movie without once taking time out to go to the bathroom. The pain in
his groin was excruciating. He imagined it felt something like what Evoe, that
fellow in the movie, had experienced after he castrated himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Where the hell is the
John?&quot; said Joe loudly. There was no one in the room. While he was absorbed
in the movie, they, doubtless having seen it before, had crept away softly,
leaving him alone to watch the death of Atlantis.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Christ's sake,&quot; he
muttered. &quot;Gotta take a leak. If I don't find the bathroom right away I'll
pee in my pants.&quot; Then he noticed a wastepaper can tinder the table. It was
walnut with a metal lining. He bent over and picked it up, sending new tremors
of anguish through a body on the verge of bursting. He decided to use it as a
receptacle, set it down again, unzipped his fly, took out his dick and let go
into the can. What if they all came trooping back into the room now, he thought.
Well, he would be embarrassed, but what the hell. It was their fault for
springing this movie on him without giving him a chance to make himself
comfortable. Joe looked somberly down into the foam.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Piss on Atlantis,&quot; he
muttered. Who the hell were those people he'd seen tonight? Simon and Padre and
Big John had never told him about a group like this. Nor had they ever said
anything about Atlantis. But there was the clear implication, if this movie was
to be believed, that the Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria might better be
called the Ancient Illuminated Seers of Atlantis. And that the word
&quot;Ancient&quot; meant a lot older than 1776.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It was clearly time to leave this
place. He could try searching the offices, but he doubted whether he'd find
anything, and, anyway, he was much too tired and hung over—not only from the
alcohol he'd drunk, but also from the strange drug the Oriental girl had given
him before the movie. Still, it had been a very nice drug. It had been Joe's
habit since 1969, when he wasn't too busy and didn't have to get up early in the
morning, to get stoned and watch late movies on television. He found this so
enjoyable a pastime that he'd lost two girlfriends to it; they'd both wanted to
go to bed when he was just settling down in front of the tube, laughing himself
silly at the incredibly clever witticisms, marveling at the profundity of the
philosophical aphorisms tossed off by the characters (such as Johnny's line in <i>Bitter
Rice: </i>&quot;I work all week and then on Sundays I watch other people ride
the merry-go-round&quot;—what a world of pathos had been expressed in that
simple summation of a man's life) or appreciating, as one wordsmith does
another, the complex subtlety of the commercials and the secret links between
them and the movies into which they were inserted (like the slogan: &quot;You
can take the Salem out of the country but you can't take the country out of
Salem,&quot; in the middle of <i>The Wolf Man). </i>All of this capacity for
appreciating movies had been raised to a new high with the drug Mao Tsu-hsi had
given him, and added to this it was a full-color movie on a large screen
uninterrupted by commercials or, come to think of it, by fnords—and
commercials no matter how trickily interwoven with the plot of the movie did
tend to <i>seem </i>like interruptions, even to one who was stoned enough to
know better. It had been a great movie. The best movie of his life. He would
never forget it. Joe tried the knob of the boardroom door and it opened at once.
He stopped, considering whether he should take out his pocket knife and carve
&quot;Malik was here&quot; or some obscenity into the beautiful wood of the
table. That would, he felt in an obscure way, let them know that he knew where
they were at. But it would be a shame to spoil the wood, and besides, he was
dreadfully tired. He walked through darkened outer corridors, staggered down the
stairs and let himself out into the street. Looking toward the East River, he
thought he could see light in the sky over Queens. Was the sun coming up? Had he
been there that long?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A cab cruised by
with its light on. Joe hailed it. Sinking into the back seat as he gave the
driver his home address, he noticed that the man's name on his hack license was
Albert Feather.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Well, here's that ladder now, Come
on, let's climb. The first rung is yours, The rest are mine</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Funny, thought Lieutenant Otto
Waterhouse of the State's Attorney's Police. Every time things get hairy, that
damn song starts going through my head. I must be an obsessive-compulsive
neurotic. He'd first heard the song, &quot;To Be a Man&quot; by Len Chandler, at
the home of a chick he was balling back in '65. It expressed pretty well for him
his condition as a member of the tribe. The tribe, that was how he thought of
black people; he'd heard a Jew refer to the Jews that way, and he liked it
better than that soul brother shit. Deep down, he hated other blacks and he
hated being black. You had to climb, that was the thing. You had to climb, each
man alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">When Otto Waterhouse was eight years
old, a gang of black kids on the South Side had beaten him, knifed him and
thrown him into Lake Michigan to drown. Otto didn't know how to swim, but
somehow he'd pulled himself along the concrete pilings, clinging to rusty steel
where there was nothing to cling to, his </span>blood seeping out into the
water, and he'd stayed there, hidden, till the gang went away. Then he pulled
himself along to a ladder, climbed up and dragged himself onto the concrete
pier. He lay there, almost dead, wondering if the gang would come back and
finish him.</p>
<p>Someone did come along. A cop. The cop nudged Otto's body with his toe,
rolled it over and looked down. Otto looked up at the Irish face, round,
pig-nosed and blue-eyed.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, shit,&quot; said the cop, and walked on.</p>
<p>Somehow Otto lived till morning, when a woman came along and found him and
called an ambulance. Years later, it seemed logical enough to him to join the
police force. He knew the members of the gang that nearly killed him. He didn't
bother with them until after he got on the force. Then he found cause to kill
each of the gang members—several of whom had by then become respectable
citizens—one by one. Most of them didn't know who he was or why he was killing
them. The number he killed made his reputation in the Chicago Police Department.
He was a nigger cop who could be trusted to deal with niggers.</p>
<p>Otto never did know who the cop was who'd left him to die—he remembered the
face, more or less, but they all looked alike to him.</p>
<p>He had another oddly vivid memory, of a fall day in 1970 when he'd been
walking through Pioneer Court and had hassled a dude who was giving out free
samples of—of all things—tomato juice. Otto took a ten from the dude and
drank some tomato juice. The guy had a crew haircut and wore horn-rimmed
glasses. He didn't seem to mind having to pay a bribe, and he looked at Otto
with an odd gleam in his eye as the tomato juice went down. For a moment, Otto
thought the tomato juice might be poisoned. There were cop haters everywhere;
many people seemed to have sworn to kill the &quot;pigs&quot; as they called
them. But dozens of people had already drunk the juice and gone away happy. Otto
shrugged and walked off.</p>
<p>Thinking back over the strange changes that had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">come over him, Otto always traced them back to that moment. There had
been something in the juice.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It wasn't till Stella Maris told him
about AUM that he realized how he'd been had. And by then it was too late. He
was a three-way loser, working for the Syndicate, the Illuminati and Discordian
Movement. The only way out was down—down into the chaos with Stella pointing
the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Just tell me one thing,
baby,&quot; he said to her one afternoon as they lay naked together in his
apartment in Hyde Park. &quot;Why did they pick you to contact me?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Because you hate niggers,&quot;
said Stella calmly, running her finger down his dick. &quot;You hate niggers
worse than any white man does. That's why the way to freedom for you lies
through me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And what about you?&quot; he
said angrily, pulling away from her and sitting up in bed. &quot;I suppose you
can't tell the difference between black and white. Black meat and white meat,
it's all the same to you, ain't it, you goddamned <i>whore!&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You'd like to think so,&quot;
said Stella. &quot;You'd like to think only a nigger whore would lay you, a
whore who'd lay anybody regardless of race. But you know you are wrong. You know
that Otto Waterhouse, the black man who is better than all black men because he
hates all black men, is a lie. It's you who can't tell the difference between
black and white and thinks the black man should be where the white man is and
hates the black man because he isn't white. No, I see color. But I see
everything else about a person, too, baby. And I know that nobody is where they
should be and everybody should be where they are.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, fuck your goddam
philosophy,&quot; said Water-house. &quot;Come here.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But he learned. He thought he'd
learned everything Stella and Hagbard and the rest of them had to teach him. And
that was a lot, piled on top of all that Illuminati garbage. But now they'd
thrown him a total curve.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He was to kill.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The message came, as all the messages
did, from Stella.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Hagbard said to do this?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And I suppose, if I go along
with this, <i>I''ll </i>be told why later on, or I'll figure it out for myself?
Goddam, Stella, this is asking a lot, you know.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I know. Hagbard told me you
have to do this for two reasons. First, for the honor of the Discordians, so
that they will have respect.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;He <i>sounds </i>like a wop for
once. But he's right. I understand that.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Second. He said because Otto
Waterhouse must kill a white man.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What?&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Otto
started to tremble in the phone booth. He picked nervously, without reading it,
at a sticker that said, THIS PHONE BOOTH RESERVED FOR CLARK</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">KENT.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Otto Waterhouse must kill a
white man. He said you'd know what that meant.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Otto's hand was still shaking when he
hung up. &quot;Oh, <i>damn,&quot; </i>he said. He was almost crying.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">So now on April 28 he stood at a
green metal door marked &quot;1723.&quot; It was the service entrance to a
condominium apartment at 2323 Lake Shore Drive. Behind him stood a dozen State's
Attorney's police. All of them, like himself, were wearing body armor and
baby-blue helmets with transparent plastic visors. Two were carrying submachine
guns.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;All right,&quot; said
Waterhouse, glancing at his watch. It had amused Flanagan to set the time for
the raid at 5:23 A.M. It was 5:22:30. &quot;Remember—-shoot everything that
moves.&quot; He kept his back to the men so they would not see the damned tears
that Insisted on welling up in his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Right on, lieutenant,&quot;
said Sergeant O'Banion satirically. Sergeant O'Banion hated blacks, but worse
than that he hated filthy, lice-ridden, long-haired, homosexual,
Communist-inspired Morituri bomb manufacturers. He believed that there was a
whole disgusting nest of them, sleeping together, dirty naked bodies entwined,
like a can full of worms, just on the other side of that green metal door. He
could see them. He licked his lips. He was going to clean them out. He hefted
the machine gun.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Okay,&quot; said Waterhouse. It
was 5:23. Shielding himself with one gloved hand, he pointed his .45 at the lock
on the door. The instructions given orally by Flanagan at the briefing were that
they would not show a warrant or even knock before entering. The apartment was
said to be full of enough dynamite to wipe out the entire block of luxury
high-rise apartment houses. Presumably the kids, if they knew they were caught,
would set them off. That way they could take a bunch of pigs with them, preserve
their reputation for suicidal bravery, protect themselves from giving away any
information, use the explosives and avoid having to live with the shaming
knowledge that they'd been dumb enough to get caught.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">O'Banion was imagining finding a
white girl in the arms of a black boy and finishing them off with one burst from
his machine gun. His cock swelled in his pants.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Waterhouse fired.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In the next instant he threw his
weight against the door and smashed it open. He was in a hallway next to the
kitchen. He walked into the apartment. His shoes rang on a bare tile floor.
Tears ran down his cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;My God, my God, why have you
forsaken me?&quot; he sobbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Who's that?&quot; a voice
called. Waterhouse, whose eyes had adjusted to the darkness, looked across the
empty living room into the foyer, where Milo A. Flanagan stood silhouetted in
the light from the exterior hall.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Waterhouse raised the heavy automatic
in his hand to arm's length, sighted carefully, took a deep breath and held it
and squeezed the trigger. The pistol blasted and kicked his hand and the black
figure went toppling </span>backwards into the startled arms of the men behind
him.</p>
<p>A bat which had been sitting on a windowsill flew out the open window toward
the lake. Only Water-house saw it.</p>
<p>O'Banion came clumping into the room. He took a bent-kneed stance and fired a
burst of six rounds in the direction of the front door.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold it!&quot; Waterhouse snapped. &quot;Hold your fire. Something's
wrong.&quot; Something would really be wrong if the guys at the front door came
through again, shooting. &quot;Turn on the lights, O'Banion,&quot; Waterhouse
said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's somebody in here shooting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're standing here talking, O'Banion. No one is shooting at us. Find a
light switch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're gonna set off the bombs!&quot; O'Banion's voice was shrill with
fear.</p>
<p>&quot;With the lights on, O'Banion, we'll see them doing it. Maybe we'll even
be able to stop them.&quot;</p>
<p>O'Banion ran to the wall and began slapping it with the palm of one hand
while he kept his machine gun cradled in the free arm. One of the other men who
had followed O'Banion through the service entrance found the light switch.</p>
<p>The apartment was bare. There was no furniture. There were no rugs on the
floor, no curtains on the windows. Whoever had been living here had vanished.</p>
<p>The front door opened a crack. Before they could start shooting Waterhouse
yelled, &quot;It's all right. It's Waterhouse in here. There's nobody
here.&quot; He wasn't crying anymore. It was done. He had killed his first white
man.</p>
<p>The door swung all the way open. &quot;Nobody <i>there?&quot; </i>said the
helmeted policeman. &quot;Who the hell shot Flanagan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Flanagan?&quot; said Waterhouse.</p>
<p>&quot;Flanagan's dead. They got him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There isn't anybody here,&quot; said O'Banion, who had been looking
through side rooms. &quot;What the hell went wrong? Flanagan set this up
personally.&quot;</p>
<p>Now that the light was on, Waterhouse could see that someone had drawn a
pentagram in chalk on the floor. In the center of the pentagram was a gray
envelope. Otto picked it up. There was a circular green seal on the back with
the word ERIS embossed on it Otto opened it and read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good going, Otto. Now proceed at once to Ingolstadt, Bavaria. The bastards
are trying to immanentize the Eschaton.</p>
<p>S-M</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folding the note and shoving it into his pocket as he bolstered his pistol
with his other hand, Otto Water-house strode across the living room. He barely
glanced down at the body of Milo A. Flanagan, the bullet hole in the center of
his forehead like a third eye. Hagbard had been right. Despite all the advance
terror and sorrow, once he'd done it, he didn't feel a thing. I have met the
enemy and he is mine, he thought.</p>
<p>Otto pushed past the men crowded around Flanagan's body. Everyone assumed he
was going somewhere to make some sort of report. No one had figured out who shot
Flanagan.</p>
<p>By the time O'Banion had puzzled it out, Otto was already in his car. Six
hours later, when they had set up blockades at the airports and railway
terminals, Otto was in Minneapolis International Airport buying a ticket to
Montreal. He had to fly back to Chicago, but he sat out the brief stopover at
O'Hare International Airport aboard the plane, while his brother officers
searched the terminals for him. Twelve hours later, carrying a passport supplied
by Montreal Discordians, Otto Waterhouse was on his way to Ingolstadt.</p>
<p>&quot;Ingolstadt,&quot; said FUCKUP. Hagbard had programmed the machine to
converse in reasonably good English this week. &quot;The largest rock festival
in the history of mankind, the largest temporary gathering of human beings ever
assembled, will take place near Ingolstadt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">on the shore of Lake Totenkopf. Two million young people from all over
the world are expected. The American Medical Association will play.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Did you know or suspect before
this that the American Medical Association, Wolfgang, Werner, Wilhehn and
Winifred Saure, are four of the Dluminati Primi?&quot; asked Hagbard.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;They were on a list, but
fourteenth in order of probability,&quot; said FUCKUP. &quot;Perhaps some of the
other groups I suspected are Illuminati Veri.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Can you now state the nature of
the crisis that we will face this week?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There was a pause. &quot;There were
three crises for this month. Plus several subcrises designed to bring the three
major crises to a peak. The first was Fernando Poo. The world nearly went to war
over the Fernando Poo coup, but the Illuminati had a countercoup in reserve and
that resolved the problem satisfactorily. Heads of state are human and this
feint has helped to make them jumpier and more irrational. They are in no shape
to react wisely to the next two jolts. Unless you wish me to continue discussing
the character structures of the present heads of state—which are important
elements in the crises through which the world is passing—I will proceed to
the next crisis. This is Las Vegas. I still do not know exactly what is going on
there, but the sickness vibrations are still coming through strongly. There is,
I have deduced from recently acquired information, a bacteriological warfare
research center located in the desert somewhere near Las Vegas. One of my more
mystical probes came up with the sentence, &quot;The ace in the hole is poisoned
candy.' But that's one of those things that we probably won't understand until
we find out what's going on in Las Vegas by more conventional means.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I've already dispatched Muldoon
and Goodman there,&quot; said Hagbard. &quot;All right, FUCKUP, obviously the
third crisis is Ingolstadt. What's going to happen at that rock festival?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;They intend to use the
Illuminati science of strategic biomysticism. Lake Totenkopf is one of Europe's
famed 'bottomless lakes,' which means it has an outlet into the underground Sea
of Valusia. At the end of World War II Hitler had an entire S.S. division in
reserve in Bavaria. He was planning to withdraw to Obersalzburg and, with this
fanatically loyal division, make a glorious last stand in the Bavarian Alps.
Instead the Illuminati convinced him that he still had a chance to win the war,
if he followed their instructions. Hitler, Himmler and Bormann fed cyanide to
all the troops, killing several thousand of them. Then their bodies, dressed in
full field equipment, were placed by divers on a huge underground plateau near
where the Sea of Valusia surfaces as Lake Totenkopf. Their boots were weighted
at the bottom so that they would stand at attention. The airplanes, tanks and
artillery assigned to the division were also weighted and sunk along with the
troops. Many of them, by the way, knew that there was cyanide in their last
supper, but they ate it anyway. If the Fuehrer thought it best to kill them,
that was good enough for them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I can't imagine there would be
much left of them after over thirty years,&quot; said Hagbard.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You are wrong as usual,
Hagbard,&quot; said FUCKUP. &quot;The S.S. men were placed under a biomystical
protective field. The entire division is as good as it was the day it was placed
there. Of course, the Illuminati had tricked Hitler and Himmler. The real
purpose of the mass sacrifice was to provide enough explosively released
consciousness energy to make it possible to translate Bormann to the immortal
energy plane. Bormann, one of the Illuminati Primi of his day, was to be
rewarded for his part in organizing World War II. The fifty million violent
deaths of that war helped many Illuminati to achieve transcendental illumination
and were most pleasing to their elder brothers and allies, the lloigor.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And what will happen at
Ingolstadt during the festival?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The American Medical
Association's fifth number at Woodstock Europa will send out biomystical waves
that will activate the Nazi legions in the lake, and send them marching up the
shore. They will be, in their resurrection, endowed with supernormal strength
and energy, making them almost impossible to kill. And they will achieve even
greater powers as a result of the burst of consciousness energy that will be
released when they massacre the millions of young people on the shore. Then, led
by the Saures, they will turn against Eastern Europe. The Russians, already made
extremely nervous by the Fernando Poo incident, will think an army is attacking
them from the West. Their old fear that Germany will once again, with the help
of the capitalist powers, rise up and attack Russia and slaughter Russians for
the third time in this century will become a reality. They will find that
conventional weapons will not stop the resurrected Nazis. They will believe they
are up against some new kind of American super-weapon, that the Americans have
decided to launch a sneak attack. The Russians will then start bringing
superweapons of their own into play. Then the Illuminati will play their ace in
the hole in Las Vegas, whatever that is.&quot; The voice of the computer, coming
from Hagbard's Polynesian teakwood desk, was suddenly silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What happens after that?&quot;
said Hagbard, leaning forward tensely. George saw perspiration on his forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It doesn't matter what happens
after that,&quot; said FUCKUP. &quot;If the situation develops as I project, the
Eschaton will have been immanentized.For the Illuminati, that will mean the
fulfillment of the project that has been their goal since the days of Gruad. A
total victory. They will all simultaneously achieve transcendental illumination.
For the human race, on the other hand, that will be extinction. The end.&quot;</span></p>
