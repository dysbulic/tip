<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 25 began, for John Dillinger, with a quick skimming of the <i>New York
Times; </i>he noticed more fnords than usual. &quot;The fit's about to hit the
shan,&quot; he thought grimly, turning on the eight o'clock news—only to catch
the story about the Drake Mansion, another bad sign. In Las Vegas, in rooms
where the light never changed, none of the gamblers noticed that it was now
morning; but Carmel, returning from the desert, where he had buried Sherri
Brandi, drove out of his way to look over Dr. Charles Mocenigo's home, hoping to
see or hear something helpful; he heard only a revolver shot, and quickly sped
away. Looking back, he saw flames leaping toward the sky. And, over the
mid-Atlantic, R. Buckminster Fuller glanced at his three watches, noting that it
was two in the morning on the plane, midnight at his destination (Nairobi) and 6
A.M. back home in Carbondale, Illinois. (In Nairobi itself, Nkrumah Fubar, maker
of voodoo dolls that caused headaches to the President of the United States,
prepared for bed, looking forward to Mr. Fuller's lecture at the university next
morning. Mr. Fubar, in his sophisticated-primitive way, like Simon Moon in his
primitive-sophisticated way, saw no conflict between magic and mathematics.)</p>
<p>In Washington, D.C., the clocks were striking five when Ben Volpe's stolen
Volkswagen pulled up in front of the home of Senator Edward Coke Bacon, the
nation's most distinguished liberal and leading hope of all those young people
who hadn't yet joined Morituri groups. &quot;In quick and out quick,&quot; Ben
Volpe said tersely to his companions, &quot;a <i>cowboy.&quot; </i>Senator Bacon
turned in his bed (Albert &quot;the Teacher&quot; Stern fires directly at the
Dutchman) and mumbled, &quot;Newark.&quot; Beside him, his wife half woke and
heard a noise in the garden <i>(Mama mama mama, </i>the Dutchman mumbles):
&quot;Mama,&quot; she hears her son's voice saying, as she sinks back toward a
dream. The rain of bullets jolts her awake into a sea of blood and in one flash
she sees her husband dying beside her, her son twenty years ago weeping for a
dead turtle, the face of Mendy Weiss, and Ben Volpe and two others backing out
of the room.</p>
<p><i>But, in 1936, when Robert Putney Drake returned from Europe to accept a
vice presidency in his father's bank in Boston, the police already knew that
Albert the Teacher really hadn't shot the Dutchman. </i>There were even a few,
such as Elliot Ness, who knew the orders had come from Mr. Lucky Luciano and Mr.
Al-phonse &quot;Scarface&quot; Capone (residing in Atlanta Penitentiary) and had
been transmitted through Federico Maldonado. Nobody, outside the Syndicate
itself, however, could name Jimmy the Shrew, Charley the Bug and Mendy Weiss as
the actual killers—nobody except Robert Putney Drake.</p>
<p>On April 1, 1936, Federico Maldonado's phone rang and, when he answered it, a
cultivated Boston voice said conversationally, &quot;Mother is the best bet.
Don't let Satan draw you too fast.&quot; This was followed by an immediate click
as the caller hung up.</p>
<p>Maldonado thought about it all day and finally mentioned it to a very close
friend that evening. &quot;Some nut calls me up today and gives me part of what
the Dutchman told the cops before he died. Funny thing about it—he gives one
of the parts that would really sink us all, if anybody in the police or the Feds
could understand it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's the way some nuts are,&quot; pronounced the other Mafioso don,
an elegant elderly gentleman resembling one of Frederick II's falcons.
&quot;They're tuned in like gypsies. Telepathy, you know? But they get it all
scrambled because they're nuts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess that's it,&quot; Maldonado agreed. He had a crazy uncle
who would sometimes blurt out a Brotherhood secret that he couldn't possibly
know, in the middle of ramblings about priests making it with altar boys and
Mussolini hiding on the fire escape and nonsense like that. &quot;They tune
in—like the Eye, eh?&quot; And he laughed.</p>
<p>But the next morning, the phone rang again, and the same voice said with
elaborate New England intonation, &quot;Those dirty rats have tuned in. French
Canadian bean soup.&quot; Maldonado broke into a cold sweat; it was that moment,
in fact, when he decided his son, the priest, would say a mass for the Dutchman
every Sunday.</p>
<p>He thought about it all day. Boston—the accent was Boston. They had witches
up there once. French Canadian bean soup. Christ, Harvard is just outside Boston
and Hoover is recruiting Feds from the Harvard Law School. Were there lawyers
who were witches, too? Cowboy the son of a bitch, I told them, and they found
him in the men's crapper. That damned Dutchman. A bullet in his gut and he lives
long enough to blab everything about the <i>Segreto. </i>The goddam <i>tedeschi
. . .</i></p>
<p>Robert Putney Drake dined on lobster Newburg that evening with a young lady
from one of the lesser-known branches of the House of Morgan. Afterward, he took
her to see <i>Tobacco Road </i>and, in the cab back to his hotel, they talked
seriously about the sufferings of the poor and the power of Henry Hull's
performance as Jeeter. Then he took her up to his room and fucked her from hell
to breakfast. At ten in the morning, after she had left, he came out of the
shower, stark naked, thirty-three years old, rich, handsome, feeling like a
healthy and happy predatory mammal. He looked down at his penis, thought of
snakes in mescaline visions back in Zurich and donned a bathrobe which cost
enough to feed one of the starving families in the nearby slums for about six
months. He lit a fat Cuban cigar and sat down by the phone, a male mammal,
predatory, happy. He began to dial, listening to the clicks, the dot and the dot
and the dot-dot, remembering the perfume his mother had worn leaning over his
crib one night thirty-two years ago, the smell of her breasts, and the time he
experimentally tried homosexuality in Boston Common with the pale faggot
kneeling before him in the toilet stall and the smell of urine and Lysol
disinfectant, the scrawl on the door saying ELEANOR ROOSEVELT SUCKS and his
instant fantasy that it wasn't a faggot genuflecting in church before bis hot
hard prick but the President's wife . . . &quot;Yes?&quot; said the taut, angry
voice of Banana Nose Maldonado.</p>
<p>&quot;When I reached the can, the boy came at me,&quot; Drake drawled, his
mild erection becoming warm and rubbery. &quot;What happened to the other
sixteen?&quot; He hung up quickly. (&quot;The analysis is brilliant,&quot;
Professor Tochus at Harvard had said of his paper on the last words of Dutch
Schultz. &quot;I particularly like the way you've combined both Freud and Adler
in finding sexuality and power drives expressed in the same image at certain
places. That is quite original.&quot; Drake laughed and said: &quot;The Marquis
de Sade anticipated me by a century and a half, I fear. Power—and
possession— <i>are </i>sexual, to some males.&quot;)</p>
<p><i>Drake's brilliance had also been noted by Jung's circle in Zurich.
Once—when Drake was off taking mes-caline with Paul Klee and friends on what
they called their Journey to the East—Drake had been a topic of long and
puzzled conversation in lung's study. &quot;We haven't seen his tike since Joyce
was here,&quot; one woman</i></p>
<p><i>psychiatrist commented. &quot;He is brilliant, yes,&quot; Jung said sadly,
&quot;but evil. So evil that I despair of comprehending him. I even wonder what
old Freud would think. This man doesn't want to murder his father and possess
his mother; he wants to murder God and possess the cosmos.&quot;</i></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Maldonado got two phone calls the
third morning. The first was from Louis Lepke, and was crudely vehement:
&quot;What's up, Banana Nose?&quot; The insult of using the forbidden nickname
in personal conversation was deliberate and almost unforgivable, but Maldonado
forgave it.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You spotted my boys following
you, eh?&quot; he asked genially.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I spotted your <i>soldiers,&quot;
</i>Lepke emphasized the word, &quot;and that means you wanted me to spot them.
What's up? You know if I get hit, you get hit.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You won't get hit, <i>caromio,&quot;
</i>Don Federico replied, still cordial. &quot;I had a crazy idea about
something I thought might be coming from inside and you're the only one who
would know enough to do it, I thought. I was wrong. I can tell by your voice.
And if I was right, you wouldn't have called me. A million apologies. Nobody
will be following you anymore. Except maybe Tom Dewey's investigators, eh?&quot;
he laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Okay,&quot; Lepke said slowly,
&quot;Call them off, and I'll forget it. But don't try to scare me again. I do
crazy things when I'm scared.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Never again,&quot; Maldonado
promised.</span></p>
<p>He sat frowning at the phone, after Lepke hung up. <i>Now I owe him, </i>he
thought. <i>I'll</i> <i>have to arrange to bump off somebody who's annoying him,
to show the proper and most courteous apology.</i></p>
<p><i>But, Virgin Mother, if it isn't the Butcher, who is it? A real witch?</i></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The phone rang again. Crossing
himself and calling on the Virgin silently, Maldonado lifted the receiver.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Let him harness himself to you
and then bother you,&quot; Robert Putney Drake quoted pleasantly, &quot;fun is
fun.&quot; He did not hang up.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Listen,&quot; Don Federico
said, &quot;who is this?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Dutch died three times,&quot;
Drake said in a sepulchral tone. &quot;When Mendy Weiss shot him, when Vince
Coil's ghost shot him and when that dumb junkie, the Teacher, shot him. But
Dillinger never even died once.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Mister, you got a deal,&quot;
Maldonado said. &quot;I'm sold. <i>I'll</i> <i>meet you anywhere. </i>In <i>broad
daylight. </i>In Central Park. <i>Any place </i>you'll feel safe.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No, you will not meet me just
now,&quot; Drake said coolly. &quot;You are going to discuss this with Mr. Lepke
and Mr. Capone, first. You will also discuss it with—&quot; he read, off a
card in his hand, fifteen names. &quot;Then, after you have all had time to
consider it, you will be hearing from me.&quot; Drake farted, as he always did
in the nervous moments when an important deal was being arranged, and hung up
quickly.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Now, </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">he
said to himself, <i>insurance.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A photostat of his second analysis of
the last words of Dutch Schultz—the private one, not the public version which
he had turned in to the Department of Psychology at Harvard—was on the hotel
desk before him. He folded it smartly and pinned on top of it a note saying,
&quot;There are five copies in the vaults of five different banks.&quot; He then
inserted it in an envelope, addressed it to Luciano and strolled out to drop it
down the hotel mail chute.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Returning to his room he dialed Louis
Lepke, born Louis Buchalter, of the organization later to be named Murder Inc.
by the sensational press. When Lepke answered, Drake recited solemnly, still
quoting the Dutchman, &quot;I get a month. They did it. Come on,
Illuminati.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Who the hell is this?&quot;
Lepke's voice cried as Drake gently cradled the phone. A few moments later, he
completed checking out of the hotel and flew home on the noon flight, to spend
five grueling twenty-hour days reorganizing and streamlining his father's bank.
On the fifth night he relaxed and took a young lady of the Lodge family to dance
to Ted Weems's orchestra and listen to their new young vocalist, Perry Como.
Afterwards, he fucked her thirteen to the dozen and seven ways to a Sunday. The
next morning, he took out a small book, in which he had systematically listed
all the richest families in America, and placed her first name and a check after
<i>Lodge, </i>as he had done with <i>Morgan </i>the week before. A Rockefeller
would be next.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He was on the noon flight to New York
and spent the day negotiating with Morgan Trust officials. That night he saw a
breadline on Fortieth Street and became profoundly agitated. Back in his hotel,
he made one of his rare, almost furtive diary entries:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Revolution could occur at any tune.
If Huey Long hadn't been shot last year, we might have it already. If Capone had
let the Dutchman hit Dewey, the Justice Department would be strong enough now,
due to the reaction, to ensure that the State would be secure. If Roosevelt
can't maneuver us into the war when it starts, all will be lost. And the war may
be three or four years away yet. If we could bring Dillinger back, the reaction
might strengthen Hoover and Justice, but John seems to be with the other side.
My plan may be the last chance, and the Illuminati haven't contacted me yet,
although they must have tuned in. Oh, Weishaupt, what a spawn of muddleheads are
trying to carry on your work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He tore the page out nervously,
farted and crumbled it in the ashtray, where he burned it slowly. Then, still
agitated, he dialed Mr. Charles Luciano on the phone and said softly, &quot;I am
a pretty good pretzler, Winifred. Department of Justice. I even got it from the
department.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Don't hang up,&quot; Luciano
said softly. &quot;We've been waiting to hear from you. Are you still
there?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes,&quot; Drake said
carefully, with tight lips and a tighter sphincter.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Okay,&quot; Mr. Lucky said.
&quot;You know about the Illuminati. You know what the Dutchman was trying to
say to the police. You even seem to know about the <i>Liberteri </i>and Johnnie
Dillinger. How much do you want?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Everything,&quot; Drake
replied. &quot;And you are all going to offer it to me. But not yet. Not
tonight.&quot; And he hung up.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(The wheel of tune, as the Mayans
knew, spins three ways; and just as the earth revolves on its own axis,
simultaneously orbits about the sun and at the &quot;same&quot; time trails
after the sun as that star traverses the galaxy's edge, the wheel of time, which
is a wheel of <i>ifs, </i>is come round again, as Drake's phone clicks off, to
Gruad the Grayface calculating the path of a comet and telling his followers:
&quot;See? Even the heavenly bodies are subject to law, and even the lloigor, so
must not men and women also be subject to law?&quot; And in a smaller cycle,
Semper Cuni Linctus, centurion stationed in a godforsaken outpost of the Empire,
listens in boredom as a subaltern tells him excitedly: &quot;That guy we
crucified last Friday—people all over town are swearing they've seen him
walking around. One guy even claims to have put a hand through his side!&quot;
Semper Cuni Linctus smiles cynically. &quot;Tell that to the gladiators,&quot;
he says. And Albert Stern turns on the gas, takes one last fix, and full of
morphine and euphoria, dies slowly, confident that he will always be remembered
as the man who shot Dutch Schultz, not knowing that Abe Reles will reveal the
truth five years later.)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Camp-town racetrack five miles
long</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">... During Joe's second
trip on the <i>Leif Erikson, </i>they went all the way to Africa, and Hagbard
had an important conference with five gorillas. At least, he said afterwards
that it was important; Joe couldn't judge, since the conversation was in
Swahili. &quot;They speak some English,&quot; Hagbard explained back on the sub,
&quot;but I prefer Swahili, since they're more eloquent in it and can express
more nuances.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Are you the first man to teach
an ape to speak,&quot; Joe asked, &quot;in addition to your other
accomplishments?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, not at all,&quot; Hagbard
said modestly. &quot;It's an old Discordian secret. The first person to
communicate with a gorilla was an Erisian missionary named Mala-clypse the
Elder, who was born in Athens and got exiled for opposing the imposition of male
supremacy when the Athenians created patriarchy and locked up their women. He
then wandered all over the ancient world, learning all sorts of secrets and
leaving behind a priceless collection of mind-blowing legends—he's the Phoenix
Madman mentioned in the Confucian scriptures, and he passed himself off as
Krishna to recite that gorgeous Bible of revolutionary ethics, the Bhaga-vad
Gita, to Arjuna in India, among other feats. I believe you met him in Chicago
while he was pretending to be the Christian Devil.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;But how have you Discordians
concealed the fact that gorillas talk?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;We're rather close-mouthed, you
might say, and when we do speak it's usually to put somebody on or blow their
minds—&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I've noticed that,&quot; Joe
said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And the gorillas themselves are
too shrewd to talk to anybody but another anarchist. They're all anarchists
themselves, you know, and they have a very healthy wariness about people in
general and government people in particular. As one of them told me once, 'If it
got out that we can talk, the conservatives would exterminate most of us and
make the rest pay <i>rent </i>to live on our own land; and the liberals would
try to train us to be engine-lathe operators. Who the fuck wants to operate an
engine lathe?' They prefer their own pastoral and Eristic ways, and I, for one,
would never interfere with them. We do communicate, though, just as we
communicate with the dolphins. Both species are intelligent enough to realize
that it's in their interest, as part of earth's biosphere, to help the handful
of human anarchists to try to stop, or at least slow down, the bloodletting and
slaughter of our Aner-istic rulers and Aneristic mobs.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Sometimes I still get confused
about your theological terms—or are they psychological? The Aneristic forces,
especially the Illuminati, are structure freaks: they want to impose their
concept of order on everybody else. But I still get confused about the
differences between the Erisian, the Eristic and the Discordian. Not to mention
the JAMs.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Eristic is the opposite of
the Aneristic,&quot; Hagbard explained patiently, &quot;and, therefore,
identical with it. Remember the Hodge-Podge. Writers like De Sade, Max Stirner
and Nietzsche are Eristic; so are the gorillas. They represent total supremacy
of the individual, total negation of the group. It isn't necessarily the
war-of-all-against-all, as Aneristic philosophers imagine, but it can, under
stress, degenerate into that. More often, it's quite pacifistic, like our hairy
friends in the trees back there. The Erisian position is modified; it recognizes
that Aneristic forces are part of the world drama, too, and can never be totally
abolished. We merely stress the Eristic as a balance, because human society has
been tilted grotesquely toward the Aneristic side all through the Piscean age.
We Discordians are the activists in the Erisian movement; we do things. The pure
Erisians work in more mysterious ways, in accordance with the Taoist principle
of <i>wu-wei—</i>doing nothing effectively. The JAMs are left-wingers, who
might have become Aneristic except for special circumstances that led them in a
libertarian direction. But they've fucked it all up with typical left-whig
hatred trips. They haven't mastered the <i>Gita: </i>the art of fighting with a
loving heart.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Strange,&quot; Joe said.
&quot;Dr. Iggy, in the San Francisco JAM cabal, explained it to me
differently.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What would you expect?&quot;
Hagbard replied. &quot;No two who <i>know, </i>know the same in their knowing.
By the way, why haven't you told me that you're sure those gorillas back there
were just men I dressed up in gorilla suits?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'm becoming more
gullible,&quot; Joe said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Too bad,&quot; Hagbard told him
sadly. &quot;They really <i>were </i>men in gorilla suits. I was testing how
easily you could be bamboozled, and you flunked.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Now, wait a minute. They
smelled like gorillas. That was no fake. You're putting me on <i>now.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's right,&quot; Hagbard
agreed. &quot;I wanted to see if you'd trust your own senses or the word of a
Natural-Born Leader and Guru like me. You trusted your own senses, and you pass.
My put-ons are not just jokes, friend. The hardest thing for a man with
dominance genes and piratical heredity like me is to avoid becoming a goddam
authority figure. I need all the feedback and information I can get—from men,
women, children, gorillas, dolphins, computers, any conscious entity—but
nobody contradicts an Authority, you know. <i>Communication is possible only
between equals: </i>that's the first theorem of social cybernetics—and the
whole basis of anarchism—and I have to keep knocking down people's dependence
on me or I'll become a fucking Big Daddy and won't get accurate communication
anymore. If the pig-headed Illuminati and their Aneristic imitators in all the
governments, corporations, universities and armies of the world understood that
simple principle, they'd occasionally find out what's actually going on and stop
screwing up every project they start. I am Freeman Hagbard Celine and I am not
anybody's bloody leader. As soon as you fully understand that I'm your equal,
and that my shit stinks just like yours, and that I need a lay every few .days
or I get grouchy and make dumb decisions, and that there is One more trustworthy
than all the Buddhas and sages but you have to find him for yourself, then
you'll begin to understand what the Legion of Dynamic Discord is all
about.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;One more trustworthy than all
the Buddhas and sages . . . ?&quot; Joe repeated, finding himself most confused
when he had been closest to total comprehension a second earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;To receive light you must be
receptive,&quot; Hagbard</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">said curtly. &quot;Work that one out
for yourself. Meanwhile, take this back to New York and chew on it a bit.&quot;
And he presented Joe with a book entitled <i>Never Whistle While You're Pissing:
A Guide to Self-Liberation, </i>by Hagbard Celine, H.M., S.H.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Joe read the book carefully in the
following weeks—while Pat Walsh, in <i>Confrontation's </i>research
department, checked out every assertion about the Illuminati that Joe had picked
up from Hagbard, Simon, Dillinger and Dr. Ignotius—but, although some of the
book was brilliant, much was obscure, and he found no clue to the One more
trustworthy than all Buddhas. Then, one night high on Alamout Black hashish, he
started working on it with expanded and intensified consciousness. Malaclypse
the Elder? No, he was wise, and somewhat benevolent in a fey sort of style, but
certainly not trustworthy. Simon? For all his youth and nuttiness, he had
moments of incredible perception, but he was almost certainly less enlightened
than Hagbard. Dillinger? Dr. Ignotius? The mysterious Malaclypse the Younger,
who had disappeared, leaving behind only the inscrutable <i>Principia Discordia?</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Christ, Joe thought, what a male
chauvinist I am! Why didn't I think of Stella? The old joke came back to him . .
. &quot;Did you see God?&quot; &quot;Yes, and she's black.&quot; <i>Of course. </i>Hadn't
Stella presided over his initiation, in Dr. Iggy's chapel? Hadn't Hagbard said
she would preside over George Dorn's initiation, when George was ready? <i>Of
course.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Joe always remembered that moment of
ecstasy and certainty: it taught him a lot about the use and misuse of drugs and
why the Illuminati went wrong. For the unconscious, which always tries to turn
every good lay into a mother figure, had contaminated the insight which his
supraconscious had almost given him. It was many months later, just before the
Fernando Poo crisis, that he finally discovered beyond all doubt the One who was
more trustworthy than all Buddhas and all sages.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Do-da, do-da, do-da-do-da-DAY</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">...</span></p>
<p>(And Semper Cuni Linctus, the very night that he reamed his subaltern for
taking native superstitions seriously, passed an olive garden and saw the
Seventeen . . . and with them was the Eighteenth, the one they had crucified the
Friday before. <i>Magna Mater, </i>he swore, creeping closer, <i>am I losing my
mind? </i>The Eighteenth, whatshisname, the preacher, had set up a wheel and was
distributing cards to them. Now, he turned the wheel and called out the number
at which it stopped. The centurion watched, in growing amazement, as the process
was repeated several times, and the cards were marked each time the wheel
stopped. Finally, the big one, Simon, shouted &quot;Bingo!&quot; The scion of
the noble Linctus family turned and fled . . . Behind him, the luminous figure
said, &quot;Do this in commemoration of me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought we were supposed to do the bread and wine bit in
commemoration of you?&quot; Simon objected.</p>
<p>&quot;Do both,&quot; the ghostly one said. &quot;The bread and wine is too
symbolic and arcane for some folks. This one is what will bring in the mob. You
see, fellows, if you want to bring the Movement to the people, you have to start
from where the people are at. You, Luke, don't write that down. This is part of
the <i>secret </i>teachings.&quot;)</p>
<p>Slurp, slurp... <i>Camp-town ladies sing this song.</i>..</p>
<p><i>(But how do you account for a man like Drake? </i>one of Carl lung's
guests asked at the Sunday afternoon <i>Kaffeeklatsch </i>where the strange
young American had inspired so much speculation. Jung sucked on 'his pipe
thoughtfully—wondering, actually, how he could ever cure his associates of
treating him like a guru—and answered finally, &quot;A fine mind strikes on an
idea like the arrow hitting bull's-eye. The Americans have not yet produced such
a mind, because they are too assertive, too outgoing. They land on an idea, even
an important idea, like one of their fullbacks making a tackle. Hence, they
always crumple or cripple it. Drake has such a mind. He has learned everything
about power—more than Adler knows, for all his obsession <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">on
the subject—but he has not learned the important thing. That is, of course,
how ta <i>avoid </i>power. What he needs, and will probably never achieve, is
religious humility. Impossible in his country, where even the introverts are
extroverted most of the tune.&quot;)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It was a famous novelist, who was
later to win the Nobel Prize, who actually gave Drake his first lead on what the
Mafia always called <i>il Segreto. </i>They had been talking about Joyce and his
unfortunate daughter, and the novelist mentioned Joyce's attempts to convince
himself that she wasn't really schizophrenic. &quot;He told Jung, 'After all, I
do the same sorts of things with language myself.' Do you know what Jung, that
old Chinese sage disguised as a psychiatrist, answered? 'You are diving, but she
is sinking.' Incisive, of course; and yet, all of us who write anything that
goes below the surface of naturalism can understand Joyce's skepticism. We never
know for sure whether we're diving or just sinking.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">That reminded Drake of his thesis,
and he went and got the last words of Mr. Arthur Flegenheimer, a.k.a. Dutch
Schultz, from his bureau. He handed the sheets to the novelist and asked,
&quot;Would you say the author of this was diving or sinking?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The novelist read slowly, with
increasing absorption, and finally looked up to regard Drake with extremely
curious eyes. &quot;Is it a translation from the French?&quot; he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No,&quot; Drake said. &quot;The
author was an American.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;So it's not poor Artaud. I
thought it might be. He's been around the bend, as the English say, since he
went to Mexico. I understand he's currently working on some quite remarkable
astrological charts involving Chancellor Hitler.&quot; The novelist lapsed into
silence, and then asked, &quot;What do you regard as the most interesting line
in this?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot; 'A boy has never wept nor
dashed a thousand kim,' &quot; Drake quoted, since that was the line that
bothered him most.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, that boy imagery is all
personal, just repressed</span><span style="font-size:13.5pt"> </span>homosexuality,
quite ordinary,&quot; the novelist said impatiently. &quot; 'I was in the can
and the boy came at me.' I think the author hurt the boy in some way. All the
references are tinged with more than normal homosexual guilt.&quot;</p>
<p><i>My God, </i>Drake thought, <i>Vince Coll. He was young enough to seem like
a boy to Schultz. The Dutchman thought Coil's ghost was shooting at him in that
John in Newark.</i></p>
<p>&quot;I would imagine the author killed himself, or is in a mental hospital
by now,&quot; the novelist went on thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&quot;He's dead,&quot; Drake said grudgingly. &quot;But I won't give you any
more clues. It's fascinating to see how well you're doing on your own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the interesting line,&quot; the novelist said. &quot;Or three
lines rather. 'I would hear it, the Circuit Court would hear it, and the Supreme
Court might hear it. If that ain't the payoff. Please crack down on the
Chinaman's friends and Hitler's commander.' You swear this author was
American?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he came of German ancestry,&quot; Drake said, thinking of Jung's
theory of genetic memory. &quot;But Chancellor Hitler would hate to admit it.
His people were not Aryan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was Jewish?&quot; the novelist exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;What's so surprising about that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only that scarcely two or three people in the whole world, outside the
inner circle of the Nazi Party, would understand what was meant by the Chinaman
and Hitler's commander. This author must have delved very deeply into occult
literature—things like Eliphas Levi, or Ludvig Prinn, or some of the most
closely guarded Rosicrucian secrets, and then made a perfectly amazing guess in
the right direction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What in the world are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>The novelist looked at Drake for a long time, then said, &quot;I hate to even
discuss it. Some things are too vile. Some books, as your Mr. Poe said, should
not allow themselves to be read. Even I have coded things in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">my
most famous work, which is admired for all the wrong reasons. In my search for
the mystical, I have learned things I would rather forget, and the real goal of
Herr Hitler is one of those things. But you must tell me: who was this
remarkable author?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(&quot;He just called me,&quot;
Luciano told Maldonado, &quot;and I got this much at least: he's not a shakedown
artist. He's aiming big, and he's big already himself. I'm getting my lawyer out
of bed, to run down all the best Boston families, and find one with a son who
shows signs of having the old larceny in his heart. I bet it's a banking family.
I can hear money in a voice, and he has it.&quot;)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake was persistent, and finally the
novelist said, &quot;As you know, I refuse to live in Germany because of what is
happening there. Nevertheless, it is my home, and I do hear things. If I try to
explain, you must get your mind out of the arena of ordinary politics. When I
say Hitler does have a Master, that doesn't mean he is a front man in the
pedestrian political sense.&quot; The novelist paused. &quot;How can I present
the picture so you will understand it? You are not German . . . How can you
understand a people of whom it has been said, truthfully, that they have one
foot in their own land and one foot in Thule? Have you even heard of Thule?
That's the German name for the fabulous kingdom the Greeks called Atlantis.
Whether this kingdom ever existed is immaterial; the belief in it has existed
since the dawn of history and beliefs motivate actions. In fact, you cannot
understand a man's actions unless you understand his beliefs.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The novelist paused again, and then
began talking about the Golden Dawn Society in England in the 1890s.
&quot;Strange things were written by the members. Algernon Blackwood, for
instance, wrote of intelligent beings who preexisted mankind on earth. Can you
take such a concept seriously? Can you think about Black-wood's warnings, of his
guarded phrases, such as, 'Of such great powers or beings there may conceivably
be a survival, of which poetry and legend alone caught a </span>flying memory
and called them gods, monsters, mythical beings of all sorts and kinds'? Or,
Arthur Machen, who wrote of the 'miracles of Mons' during the Great War,
describing the angels, as they were called, and published this two days before
the soldiers at the scene sent back reports of the incident. Machen was in the
Golden Dawn, and he left it to rejoin the Catholic Church, warning, 'There are
sacraments of Evil as well as of Good.' William Butler Yeats was a member, too,
and you must certainly know his remarkable lines, 'What rough beast/ Its hour
come round at last/ Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?' And the Golden Dawn
was just the outer portal of the Mysteries. The things that Crowley learned
after leaving the Golden Dawn and joining the Ordo Templi Orientis . . . Hitler
suppressed both the Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis, you know. He belonged to
the Vril Society himself, where the really extraterrestrial secrets are kept . .
.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You seem to be having a hard time getting to the point,&quot; Drake
said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some things need to be approached in hints, even in allegories. You
have taken mescaline with Klee and his friends, and spent the night seeing the
Great Visions. Do I need to remind you that reality is not a one-level
affair?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; Drake said. &quot;Behind the Golden Dawn and the OTO
and the Vril Society is a hidden group of real Initiates. There was a German
branch of the Golden Dawn, and Hitler was a member. You want me to understand
that to treat these sacraments of Evil and these beings from Atlantis as no more
than fictions would be to oversimplify; is that right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Golden Dawn was founded by a German woman, carrying on a tradition
that was already a hundred years old in Bavaria. As for these powers or beings
from Thule, they do not exist in the sense that bricks and beefsteak exist,
either. The physicist, by manipulating these fantastic electrons—which, I
remind you, have to be imagined as moving from one <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">place to another without passing through any intervening space like a
fairy or a ghost—produces real phenomena, visible to the senses.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Say, then, that by manipulating
these beings or powers from Thule, certain men are able to produce effects that
can also be seen and experienced.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What was the Golden Dawn?&quot;
Drake asked, absorbed. &quot;How did it begin?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It's very old, more than
medieval. The modern organization began in 1776, with a man who quit the Jesuits
because he thought he was an atheist, until his researches into Eastern history
had surprising results ...&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(It's him! </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Hitler
screamed, <i>He has come for me! </i>And then, as Herman Rauschning recorded,
&quot;he lapsed into gibberish.&quot; <i>The boss himself, </i>Dutch Schultz
moaned, <i>Oh, mama, I can't go through with it. Please. Come on, open the soap
duckets. The chimney sweeps. Take to the sword. Shut up. You got a big mouth.)</i></span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">We've got two real possibilities, </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Lepke's
lawyer reported. <i>But one of them is Boston Irish and what you described was
the old original Boston accent. The second one is probably your man, then. His
name is Robert Putney Drake.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Standing before the house on Benefit
Street, Drake could see, across the town, the peak of Sentinel Hill and the old
deserted church that had harbored the Starry Wisdom Sect in the 1870s. He turned
back to the door and raised the old Georgian knocker <i>(remembering:
Lillibridge the reporter and Blake the painter had both died investigating that
sect), </i>then rapped smartly three times.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Howard Phillips Lovecraft, pale,
gaunt, cadaverous, opened the door. &quot;Mr. Drake?&quot; he asked genially.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It was good of you to see
me,&quot; Drake said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Lovecraft
replied, ushering him into the Colonial hallway. &quot;Any admirer of my poor
tales is always welcome here. They are so few that I could have them all here on
a single day without straining my aunt's dinner budget.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He may be one of the most
important men alive, </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake
thought, <i>and he doesn't really suspect.</i></span></p>
<p>(&quot;He left Boston by train this morning,&quot; the soldier reported to
Maldonado and Lepke. &quot;He was going to Providence, Rhode Island.&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, I have no hesitation in discussing it,&quot; Lovecraft said
after he and Drake were settled in the old book-lined study and Mrs. Gamhill had
served them tea. &quot;Whatever your friend in Zurich may feel, I am and always
have been a strict materialist.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you have been in touch with <i>these </i>people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, certainly, and an absurd lot they are, all of them. It began after
I published a story called 'Dagon' in, let me see, 1919. I had been reading the
Bible and the description of the Philistine sea god, Dagon, reminded me of sea
serpent legends and of the reconstructions of dinosaurs by paleontologists. And
the notion came to me: suppose Dagon were real, not a god, but simply a
long-lived being vaguely related to the great saurians. Simply a story, to
entertain those who enjoy the weird and Gothic in literature. You can't imagine
my astonishment when various occult groups began contacting me, asking which
group I belonged to and which side I was on. They were all terribly put out when
I made perfectly clear that I didn't believe any such rubbish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Drake asked perplexed, &quot;why did you pick up more and
more of these hidden occult teachings and incorporate them in your later
stories?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am an artist,&quot; Lovecraft said, &quot;a mediocre artist, I
fear—and don't contradict me. I value honesty above all the other virtues. I
would like to believe in the supernatural, in a world of social justice and in
my own possession of genius. But reason commands that I accept the facts: the
world is made of blind matter, the wicked and brutal always have and always will
trample on the weak and innocent, and I have a very microscopic capacity to
create a small range of esthetic effects, all macabre and limited in their
appeal to a very special audience. Nevertheless, I would that things <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">were
otherwise. Hence, although a conservative, I support certain social legislation
that might improve the conditions of the poor, and, although a poor writer, I
try to elevate the status of my own wretched prose. Vampires and ghosts and
werewolves are worn out; they provoke chuckles rather than terror. Thus, when I
began to learn of the old lore, after 'Dagon' was published, I began to use it
in my stories. You can't imagine the hours I have spent with those old volumes
at Miskatonic, wading through tons of trash—Alhazred and Levi and Von Juntzt
were all mental cases, you know—to sift out the notions that were unfamiliar
enough to cause a genuine shock, and a real shudder, in my readers.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And you've never received
threats from any of these occult groups for mentioning lok Sotot or Cthulhu
outright in your stories?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Only when I mentioned
Hali,&quot; Lovecraft said with a wry smile. &quot;Some thoughtful soul reminded
me of what happened to Bierce after <i>he </i>wrote a bit frankly on that
subject. But that was a friendly warning, not a threat. Mr. Drake, you are a
banker and a businessman. Certainly, you don't take any of this seriously?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Let me reply with a question of
my own,&quot; Drake said carefully. &quot;Why, in all the esoteric lore which
you have chosen to make exoteric through your stories, have you never mentioned
the Law of Fives?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;In fact,&quot; Lovecraft said,
&quot;I did hint at it, rather broadly, in 'At the Mountains of Madness.' Have
you not read that? It's my longest, and, I think, my best effort to date.&quot;
But he seemed abruptly paler.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;In The Case of Charles Dexter
Ward,'&quot; Drake pursued, &quot;you quote a formula from Eliphas Levi's <i>History
of Magic. </i>But you don't quote it in full. Why was that?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Lovecraft sipped his tea, obviously
framing his answer carefully. Finally he said, &quot;One doesn't have to believe
in Santa Claus to recognize that people will exchange presents at Christmas
time. One doesn't have to believe in Yog Sothoth, the Eater of Souls, to realize
how people will act who do hold that belief. It is not my intent, in any of my
writings, to provide information that will lead even one unbalanced reader to
try experiments that will result in the loss of human life.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake arose. &quot;I came here to
learn,&quot; he said, &quot;but it appears that my only possible function is to
teach. Let me remind you of the words of Lao-tse: Those who speak do not know;
those who know do not speak.' Most occult groups are in the first class, and
their speculations are as absurd as you think. But those in the second class are
not to be so lightly dismissed. They have left you alone because your stories
appear only in magazines that appeal to a small minority. These magazines,
however, have lately been printing stories about rockets and nuclear chain
reactions and other matters that are on the edge of technological achievement.
When these fantasies start coming true, which will probably occur within a
decade, there will be much wider interest in such magazines, and your stories
will be included in that renaissance. Then you will receive some very unwelcome
attention.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Lovecraft remained seated. &quot;I
think I know of whom you are speaking; I can also read newspapers and make
deductions. Even if<i> </i>they are mad enough to attempt it, they do not have
the means. They would have to take over not one government but many. That
project would keep them busy enough, I should think, to distract them from
worrying about a few lines here and there in stories that are published as
fiction. I can conceive of the next war leading to breakthroughs in rocketry and
nuclear energy, but I doubt that even that will lead many people to take my
stories seriously, or to see the connections between certain rituals, which I
have never described explicitly, and acts which will be construed as the normal
excesses of despotism.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Good day, sir,&quot; Drake said
formally. &quot;I must be off to New York, and your welfare is really not a
major concern in my life.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Good day,&quot; Lovecraft said,
rising with Colonial courtesy. &quot;Since you have been so good as to give me a
warning, I will return the favor. I do not think your interest in these people
is based on a wish to oppose them, but to serve them. I beg you to remember
their attitude toward servants.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Back out on the street, Drake experienced a momentary dejection. <i>For
nearly twenty years he's been &quot;writing about them and they haven't
contacted him. I've been rocking the boat on two continents, and they haven't
contacted me. What does it take to make them show their hand? And if I don't
have an understanding with them, anything I work out with Maldonado and Capone
is written on the wind. 1 just can't afford to deal with the Mafia before I deal
with them. What should I do—put an ad in the </i>New York Times: <i>&quot;Will
the All-Seeing Eye please look in my direction? R. P. Drake, Boston&quot;?</i></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And a Pontiac (stolen an hour before
in Kingsport) pulled away from the curb, several houses back, and started
following Drake as he left Benefit Street and walked back toward the downtown
area. He wasn't looking back, so he didn't see what happened to it, but he
noticed an old man coming toward him stop in his tracks and turn white.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Jesus on a pogo stick,&quot;
the old man said weakly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake looked over his shoulder and
saw nothing but an empty street. &quot;What is it?&quot; he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Never mind,&quot; the old man
replied. &quot;You'd <i>never </i>believe me, mister.&quot; And he cut across
the sidewalk toward a saloon.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(&quot;What do you mean, you lost
four soldiers?&quot; Maldonado screamed into the phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Just what I'm saying,&quot;
Eddie Vitelli, of the Providence gambling, heroin and prostitution Vitellis,
said. &quot;We found your Drake at a hotel. Four of the best soldiers we've got
followed him. They called in once to say he was at a house on Benefit Street. I
told them to pick him up as soon as he comes out. And that's it, period, it's
all she wrote. They're all gone, like something picked them off the face of the
earth. I've got everybody looking for the car they were in, and that's gone,
too.&quot;)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake canceled his trip to New York
and went back to Boston, plunging into bank business and mulling over his next
move. Two days later, the janitor came to his desk, hat in hand, and asked,
&quot;Could I speak to you, Mr. Drake?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes, Getty, what is it?&quot;
Drake replied testily. His tone was deliberate; the man was probably about to
ask for a raise, and it was best to put him on the defensive immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It's this, sir,&quot; the
janitor said, laying a card on Drake's desk. Drake looked down impatiently and
saw a rainbow of colors—the card was printed on some unknown plastic and
created a prismatic effect recalling his mescaline trips in Zurich. Through the
rainbow, shimmering and radiant, he saw the outlines of a thir-teen-step
pyramid, with a red eye at the top. He stared up at the janitor and saw a face
without subservience or uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Grand Master of the Eastern
United States is ready to talk to you,&quot; the janitor said softly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Holy Cleopatra!&quot; Drake
cried, and tellers turned to stare at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Kleopatra?&quot; Simon Moon
asked, twenty-three years later. &quot;Tell him about Kleopatra.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">It was a sunny afternoon in October
and the drapes in the living room of the apartment on the seventeenth floor of
2323 Lake Shore Drive were pulled back to reveal a</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">corner window view of Chicago's
Loop skyscrapers and the whitecap-dotted blue surface of Lake Michigan. Joe
sprawled in a chair facing the lake. Simon and Padre Pederastia were on a couch
under an enormous painting titled &quot;Kleopatra.&quot; She looked a good deal
like Stella Maris and was holding an asp to her bosom. The eye-and-pyramid
symbol appeared several times in the hieroglyphs on the tomb wall behind her.
Sitting in an armchair opposite the painting was a slender man with sharp, dark
features, shoulder-length chestnut hair, a forked brown beard and green eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Kleopatra,&quot; said the man,
&quot;was an instant study. Would have made her Polymother of the great globe
itself, if she'd lived. She damned near brought down the Roman Empire, and she
did shorten its life by centuries. She forced Octavius to bring so much
Aneristic power to bear that the Empire went prematurely into the state of
bureaucracy.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What do I call you?&quot; said
Joe. &quot;Lucifer? Satan?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Call me Malaclypse the
Elder,&quot; said the fork-bearded man with a smile that seemed to beam through
endless shifting veils of warm self-regard.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I don't get it,&quot; said Joe.
&quot;The first tune I saw you, we were all terrified out of our minds. Though
when you finally showed up looking like Billy Graham, I didn't know whether to
laugh or go catto. But I know I was scared.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Padre Pederastia laughed. &quot;You
were so terrified, my son, that you were trying to climb right inside our little
redhead's big red bird's nest. You were so frightened that that hefty cock of
yours&quot;—he licked his lips—&quot;was squirting juice all over the
carpet. Oh, you were terrified, all right. Oh, my, yes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Well, I wasn't so scared just
at that moment you mention,&quot; said Joe with a smile. &quot;But a little
later, when our friend here was about to appear. You were terrified yourself,
Padre Pederastia. You kept hollering, 'Come not in that form! Come not in that
form!' Now we're all sitting around the living room behaving like old
chums—and this—this <i>being </i>here is reminiscing about the good old days
with Kleopatra.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;They were terrible days,&quot;
said Malaclypse. &quot;Very cruel days, very sad days. Constant wars, tortures,
mass murders, crucifixions. Bad times.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I believe you. And what's
worse, I can understand what it means if I believe you, and I can live knowing
that you exist. And even sit down in this living room and smoke a cigarette with
you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Two lit cigarettes appeared between
Malaclypse's fingers. He passed one to Joe. Joe drew on it; it tasted sweet,
with just a hint of marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's a corny trick,&quot;
said Joe.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Just so you don't lose your old
associations to me too quickly,&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;Too quick to
understand, too soon to misunderstand.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Padre Pederastia said, &quot;The
night of that Black Mass, I simply had worked myself up to the point where I
totally believed. That's what magic is, after all. The people who were here that
night relate to left-hand magic, to the Satan myth, to the Faust legend. It's a
quick way to get them involved. It worked with you at the time, but we've
brought you along fast, because we want more help from you. So now you don't
need the trappings.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You don't have to be a Satanist
to love Malaclypse,&quot; said Malaclypse.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;In fact, its better if you're
not,&quot; said Simon. &quot;Satanists are creeps. They skin dogs alive and shit
like that.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Because most Satanists are
Christians,&quot; said Joe. &quot;Which is a very masochistic religion.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Now, just a minute—&quot;
said Padre Pederastia with some asperity.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;He's right, Pederastia,&quot;
said Malaclypse. &quot;Nobody knows that better than you—or me, for that
matter.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Did you ever meet Jesus?&quot;
Joe asked, awed in spite of his skepticism.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Malaclypse smiled. &quot;I <i>was </i>Jesus.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Padre Pederastia flapped his hands
and bounced up and down in his chair. &quot;You're telling too much!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;For me, trust is total or
nonexistent,&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;I perceive that I can trust Joe. I
wasn't the original Jesus, Joe, the one they crucified. But—this happened a
few centuries after I experienced transcendental illumination at Melos—I was
passing through Judea in the persona of a Greek merchant when they crucified
Jesus. I met some of his followers the day he died, and I talked with them. If
you think Christianity is a bloody religion as it is, this is nothing to what it</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">would have been if Jesus hadn't
seemed to come back. If the seventeen original apostles—five of them have been
purged from the records—had been left on their own, they would have passed
from horror and terror at Jesus's death to vindictive fury. It would have been
as if Islam had come seven centuries earlier. Instead of slowly taking over the
Roman Empire and preserving much of the Greco-Roman world intact, it would have
swept and mobilized the East, destroyed most of Western civilization and
replaced it with a theocracy more oppressive than Pharaonic Egypt. I stopped
that with a few magic tricks. Appearing in the persona of the resurrected</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Jesus, I taught there was no need
for hatred and vengeance after my death. I even tried to get them to realize
that life is a game by teaching them Bingo. To this day, nobody understands and
critics call it part of the <i>commercialism </i>of the Church. The sacred Tarot
wheel, the moving Mandala! So despite my influence, Christianity focused
obsessively on the crucifixion of Jesus—which is really irrelevant to what he
taught while he was alive—and remained a kind of death worship. When Paul went
to Athens and made the link-up with the Illuminati, who were using Plato's
Academy as a front, the ideology of Plato combined with the mythology of Christ
to deliver the knockout blow to pagan humanism and lay the foundations for the
modern world of superstates. After that, I changed my appearance again and took
the name of Simon Magus and had some success spreading ideas contradictory to
Christianity.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You can change your appearance
at will, then,&quot; said Joe.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, sure thing. I'm just as
quick with a thought projection as anybody.&quot; He pushed his pinkie
thoughtfully into his left nostril and worked it around. Joe stiffened; he
didn't care to watch people picking their noses in public. He looked resolutely
over Malaclypse's left shoulder. &quot;Now that you know as much as you do about
us, Joe, it's time you started working with us. Chicago, as you know, is the
Illuminati nerve center in </span>this hemisphere, so we'll use this town to
test AUM, a new drug with astonishing properties, if ELF's technicians are
correct. It's supposed to turn neophobes into neophiles.&quot;</p>
<p>Simon slapped his forehead and shouted &quot;Wow, man!&quot; and started
laughing. Pederastia gasped and whistled.</p>
<p>&quot;You look blank, Joe,&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;Has no one explained
to you that the human race is divided into two distinct genotypes—neophobes,
who reject new ideas and accept only what they have known all their lives, and
neophiles, who love new things, change, invention, innovation? For the first
four million years of man's history, all humans were neophobes, which is why
civilization did not develop. Animals are all neophobes. Only mutation can
change them. Instinct is simply the natural behavior of a neophobe. The neophile
mutation appeared about a hundred thousand years ago, and speeded up thirty
thousand years ago. However, there has never been more than a handful of
neophiles anywhere on the planet. The Illuminati themselves sprang from one of
the oldest neophile-neo-phobe conflicts on record.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I take it the Illuminati were trying to hold back progress,&quot; said
Joe. &quot;Is that their general aim?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're still thinking like a liberal,&quot; said Simon. &quot;Nobody
gives a fuck for progress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;They were the innovators in that
instance. All the Illuminati were—and are—neophiles. Even today, they see
their work as directed toward progress. They want to become like gods. It's
possible for humans, given the right methods, to translate themselves into
sentient latticeworks of pure energy that will be more or less permanent. The
process is called transcendental illumination, to distinguish it from the
acquisition of insight into the true nature of man and the universe, which is
ordinary illumination. I've gone through transcendental illumination and am a
being composed altogether of energy, as you may have guessed. However, prior to
becoming energy fields men often fall victim to hubris. Their actions cause pain
to others and make them insensitive, uncreative and irrational. Mass human
sacrifice is the most reliable method of achieving transcendental illumination.
Human sacrifice can, of course, be masked as other things, such as war, famine
and plague. The vision of the Four Horsemen vouchsafed to Saint John is actually
a vision of mass transcendental illumination.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you achieve it?&quot; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I was present at the massacre of the male inhabitants of the city of
Melos by the Athenians in 416 B.C. Have you read Thucydides?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A long time ago,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Thucydides had it wrong. He presented it as an out-and-out
atrocity, but there were extenuating circumstances. The Melians had been
stabbing Athenian soldiers in the back, poisoning them, filling them full of
arrows from ambush. Some of them were working for the Spartans and some were on
the side of Athens, but the Athenians didn't know which ones they could trust.
They didn't want to do any unnecessary killing, but they did want to get back to
Athens alive. So they rounded up all the Melian men one day and hacked them to
pieces in the town square. The women and children were sold into slavery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did you do?&quot; said Joe. &quot;Were you there with the
Athenians?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but I didn't do any killing. I was a chaplain. Of the Erisian
denomination, of course. But I was prepared to perform services to Hermes,
Dionysus, Heracles, Aphrodite, Athena, Hera and some of the other Olympians. I
almost went mad with horror—I didn't understand that Pangenitor is Panphage. I
was praying to Eris to deliver me or deliver the Melians or do something, and
she answered me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hail, she what done it all,&quot; said Simon.</p>
<p>&quot;I almost believe you,&quot; said Joe. &quot;But every once in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">a
while the suspicion creeps in that you're simply doing a two-thousand-year-old
man routine and the butt of the joke is me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Malaclypse stood up with a little
smile. &quot;Come here, Joe.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What for?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Just come here.&quot;
Malaclypse held his hands away from his sides, palms turned toward Joe
appealingly. Joe walked over and stood before him.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Put your hand into my
side,&quot; said Malaclypse.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, come on,&quot; said Joe.
Pederastia snickered. Malaclypse just looked at him with a gentle, encouraging
smile, so he reached out to touch Malaclypse's shirt. His hands still felt
nothing. He closed his eyes to verify that. There was no sensation whatever.
Thin air. Eyes still shut, he moved his hand forward. He opened his eyes, and
when he saw his arm sunk into Malaclypse's body up to the elbow, he almost
barfed bis cookies.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He drew back. &quot;It can't be a
movie. I'd be almost willing to say a moving holograph, but the illusion is too
perfect. You're looking right at me. To my eyes you are unquestionably
there.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Try a few karate chops,&quot;
said Malaclypse. Joe obliged, swinging his hand like a scythe through
Malaclypse's waist, chest and head. For a finale, Joe brought his hand straight
down through the top of the being's head.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I suspend judgment,&quot; said
Joe. &quot;Maybe you are what you say you are. But it's pretty hard to take. Can
you feel anything?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I can create, temporary sensory
organs for myself whenever I want to. I can enjoy just about anything a human
enjoys or experiences. But my primary mode of perception is a very advanced form
of what you would call intuition. Intuition is a kind of sensitivity in the mind
to events and processes; what I have is a highly developed intuitional receptor
which is completely controllable.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Joe went back and sat down, shaking
his head. &quot;You certainly are in an enviable position.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Like I said, it's the real
reason for human sacrifice,&quot; said Malaclypse. He, too, sat down, and Joe
now noticed that the soft upholstery of his chair didn't sink beneath his
weight. He seemed to rest on the surface of the cushions. &quot;Any sudden or
violent death releases a burst of consciousness energy, which can be controlled
and channeled as any explosive energy can be. The Illuminati would all like to
become as gods. That has been their ambition for longer than I care to
say.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Which means they have to
perpetrate mass murder,&quot; said Joe, thinking of nuclear weapons, gas
chambers, chemical-biological warfare.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Malaclypse nodded. &quot;Now, I don't
disapprove of that on moral grounds, since morals are purely illusory. I do have
a personal distaste for that sort of thing. Although, when you've lived as long
as I have, you have lost so many friends and lovers that it is impossible not to
take the deaths of humans as a matter of course. So it goes. And, since I
achieved my own immortality and nonmateriality as the result of a mass murder,
it would be hypocritical of me to condemn the Illuminati. For that matter, I
don't condemn hypocrisy, though it is also personally distasteful to me. But I
do say that the method of the Illuminati is stupid and wasteful, since everybody
is already everything. So, why fuck around with things? It is absurd to try to
be something else when there is nothing else.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That kind of statement is
simply beyond my comprehension,&quot; said Joe. &quot;I don't know, maybe it's
my engineering training. But even after my own partial illumination in San
Francisco with Dr. Iggy, this kind of talk doesn't make any more sense than
Christian Science to me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Soon you'll understand
more,&quot; said Malaclypse. &quot;About the history of man, about some of the
esoteric knowledge that has been lying around for tens of thousands of years.
Eventually you'll know all that's worth knowing about absolutely
everything.&quot;</span></p>
<p>(Tobias Knight, the FBI agent monitoring the bugging equipment in Dr.
Mocenigo's home, heard the pistol shot the same time Carmel did. &quot;What the
hell?&quot; he said out loud, sitting up straight. He had heard the door open
and footsteps walking about and had been waiting for a conversation . . . and
then, without warning, he had heard the shot. Now a voice spoke, &quot;Sorry,
Dr. Mocenigo. You were a great patriot, and this is a dog's death. But I will
share it with you.&quot; Then there were more footsteps and <i>something else . </i>.
. Knight recognized the sound: it was liquid being poured. The steps and the
pouring liquid continued, and Knight abruptly tore himself out of his state of
shock and pressed the intercom. &quot;Knight?&quot; asked a voice which he
recognized as Esperando Despond, the Special Agent in Charge for Las Vegas.
&quot;Mocenigo's house,&quot; Knight said crisply. &quot;Get a whole crew out
there double-quick. Something is happening, one killing at least.&quot; He
released the intercom and listened, paralyzed, to the footsteps and the liquid
sounds, which were now mixed with subdued humming. A man doing an unpleasant
job, but trying to keep his cool. Knight recognized the tune, finally:
&quot;Camp-town Races.&quot; The humming and walking and slurping continued.
&quot;Do-da-Do-da . . .&quot; Then the voice spoke again: &quot;This is General
Lawrence Stewart Talbot, speaking to the CIA, the FBI and whoever else has this
house bugged. I discovered at two this morning that several people in our
Anthrax Leprosy Pi project have accidentally been subjected to live cultures.
All of them are living at the installation, and can easily be isolated while the
antidote works. I have already given orders to that effect. Dr. Mocenigo himself
unknowingly received the worst dose, and was in advanced morbidity, a few
minutes from death, when I arrived. His whole house, obviously, will have to be
burned down, and I am also, due to my proximity while examining him, too far
gone to be saved. I will therefore shoot myself after setting fire to the house.
There is one remaining problem. I found evidence that a woman had been in Dr. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Mocenigo's
bed earlier—that's what comes of allowing important people to live off
base—and she must be found and given the antidote and each of her contacts
must be traced. Needless to say, this must be done quietly, or there will be a
nationwide panic. Tell the President to see that my wife gets the medal for
this. Tell my wife that with my last breath I still insist she was wrong about
that girl in Red Lion, Pennsylvania. In closing, I firmly believe that this is
the greatest country in the history of the world, and can still be saved if
Congress will lock up those damned college kids for once and for all. God bless
America!&quot; There was a scratching sound—my God! Knight thought, the
match—and the sound of flames, in the midst of which General Talbot tried to
add a postscript but couldn't get the words out because he was screaming.
Finally, the second shot came, and the screaming stopped. Knight raised his
head, jaw clenched, repressed tears in his steely eyes. &quot;That was a great
American,&quot; he said aloud.)</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Over cigars and brandy, after George
had been sent off to bed to be distracted by Tarantella, Richard Jung asked
pointedly, &quot;Just how sure are you that this Discordian bunch is a match for
the Illuminati? It's kind of late La the game to change sides.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake started to speak, then turned
to Maldonado. &quot;Tell him about Italy in the 19th century,&quot; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Illuminati are just men and
women,&quot; Maldonado replied obligingly. &quot;More women than men, in fact.
It was Eve Weishaupt who started the whole show; Adam just acted as her front
because people are used to taking orders from men. This Atlantis stuff is mostly
bullshit. Everybody who knows about Atlantis at all traces his family, or his
clan, or his club, back there. Some of the old dons in the Maf even try to trace
<i>la Cosa Nostra </i>back there. All bullshit. Just like all the WASPs tracing
themselves back to the <i>Mayflower. </i>For everyone who can prove it, like Mr.
Drake, there's a hundred who are just bluffing.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You see,&quot; Maldonado went
on more intensely, </span>chewing his cigar ferociously, &quot;originally the
Illuminati was just a—how do you call it—a kind of 18th-century women's
liberation front. Behind Adam Weishaupt was Eve; behind Godwin, who started all
this socialism and anarchism with his <i>Political Justice </i>book, was his
mistress Mary Wollstonecraft, who started the woman revolution with a book
called, uh . . .&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; </i>Drake contributed.</p>
<p>&quot;And they got Tom Paine to write on women's lib, too, and to defend
their French Revolution and try to import it here. But that all fell through and
they didn't get a real controlling interest in the U.S. until they hoodwinked
Woody Wilson into creating the Federal Reserve in 1914. And that's the way it
usually goes. In Italy they had a front called the Haute Vente, that was so damn
secret Mazzini was a member all his life and never knew the control came from
Bavaria. My grandpa told me all about those days. We had a three-way dogfight.
The Monarchists on one side, the Haute Vente and the Liberteri, the anarchists,
on the other, and the Maf in the middle trying to roll with the punches and
figure out which way the bread was buttered, you know? Then the Liberteri got
wise to the Haute Vente and split from it, and it was a four-way fight. You look
it up in the history books, they tell it like it was except they don't mention
who ran the Haute Vente. And then the good old Law of Fives came into it, and we
had the Fascisti and it was a five-way dogfight. Who won? Not the Illuminati. It
wasn't until 1937, manipulating the English government to discourage Mussolini's
peace plans and using Hitler to get Benito into the Berlin-Tokyo axis, that the
Illuminati had some kind of control in Italy. And even then it was indirect.
When we made our deal with the CIA—it was called the OSS back in those
days—Luciano got out of the joint and we turned over Italy and delivered
Mussolini dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the point of all this?&quot; Jung asked coldly.</p>
<p>&quot;The point is,&quot; Maldonado said, &quot;the Maf has been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">against
the Illuminati more of the time than we've been with them, and we're still doing
business and we're stronger than ever. Believe me, their bark is much worse than
their bite. Because they know some magic, they scare everybody. We've had
magicians and belladonnas—witches, to you—in Sicily since before Paris got
hot pants for Helen, and believe me a bullet kills them as dead as it kills
anybody else.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Illuminati <i>do </i>have a
bite,&quot; Drake interjected, &quot;but it is my judgment that they are going
out with the Age of Pisces. The Discordians, I think, represent an Aquarian
swing.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, I don't go for that mystic
stuff,&quot; Jung said. &quot;Next thing you'll be quoting <i>I</i> <i>Ching </i>at
me, like my old man.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You're an anal type, like most
accountants,&quot; Drake replied coolly. &quot;And a Capricorn as well.
Down-to-earth and conservative. I won't attempt to persuade you about this
aspect of the matter. Just take my word, I didn't get where I am by ignoring
significant facts just because they won't fit on a profit-and-loss statement. On
the profit-and-loss level, however, I have had reasons to believe that the
Discordians can currently outbid the Illuminati. These reasons date back many
months before the appearance of those marvelous statues today.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Later, in bed, Drake turned the
matter around in his head and looked at it from several sides. Lovecraft's words
came back to him: &quot;I beg you to remember their attitude toward their
servants.&quot; That was it, basically. He was an old man, and he was tired of
being their servant, or satrap, or satellite. When he was thirty-three, he was
ready to take them over, as Cecil Rhodes had once done. Somehow, he had been
maneuvered into taking over just one section of their empire. If he could think,
truthfully, that he owned the United States more thoroughly than any President
in four decades, the fact remained that he did not own himself. Not until he
signed his Declaration of Independence tonight by joining the Discordians. The
other Jung, the <i>alter Zauber </i></span>in Zurich, had tried to tell him
something about power once, but he had dismissed it as sentimental slop. Now he
tried to remember it ... and, suddenly, all the old days came back, Klee and his
numinous paintings, the Journey to the East, old Crowley saying, &quot;Of
course, mixing the left-hand and right-hand paths is dangerous. If you fear such
risks, go back to Hesse and Jung and those old ladies. Their way is safe and
mine isn't. All that can be said for me is that I have real power and they have
dreams.&quot; But the Illuminati had crushed Crowley, just as they smashed
Willie Seabrook, when those men revealed too much. &quot;<i>I beg you to
remember their attitude toward their servants.&quot; </i>Damn it, what was it
Jung had said about power?</p>
<p>And he turned the card over, and on the back was an address on Beacon Hill
with the words &quot;8:30 tonight.&quot; He looked up at the janitor, who backed
away deferentially, saying, &quot;Thank you, Mr. Drake, sir,&quot; without a
touch of irony in his face or voice. And it hadn't surprised him at all that,
for deliberate contrast, the Grand Master he met that night, one of the five
Illuminati Primi for the U.S., was an official of the Justice Department. (And
what had Jung said about power?) &quot;A few of them will have to fall. Lepke, I
would recommend. Perhaps Luciano also.&quot; No mystical trappings: just a
businesslike meeting. &quot;Our interest is the same as yours: increasing the
power of the Justice Department. An equal increment in the power of the other
branches of government will proceed nicely when we get the war into gear.&quot;
Drake remembered his excitement: it was all as he had foreseen. The end of the
Republic, the dawn of the Empire.</p>
<p>&quot;After Germany, Russia?&quot; Drake asked once.</p>
<p>&quot;Very good; you are indeed farseeing,&quot; the Grand Master replied.
&quot;Mr. Hitler, of course, is only a medium. Virtually no ego at all, on his
own. You have no idea how dull and prosaic such types are, except when under
proper Inspiration. Naturally, his supplied ego will collapse, he will become
psychotic, and we will have no control over him at all, then. We are prepared <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">to
help him fall. Our real interest now is here. Let me show you something. We do
not work in general outlines; our plans are always specific, to the last
detail.&quot; He handed Drake a sheaf of papers. &quot;The war will probably end
in '44 or '45. We will have Russia built up as the next threat within two years.
Read this carefully.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake read what was to become the
National Security Act of 1947. &quot;This abolishes the Constitution,&quot; he
said almost in ecstasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Quite. And believe me, Mr.
Drake, by '46 or '47, we will have Congress and the public ready to accept it.
The American Empire is closer than you imagine.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;But the isolationists and
pacifists—Senator Taft and that crowd—&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;They will wither away. When
communism replaces fascism as the number one enemy, your small-town conservative
will be ready for global adventures on a scale that would make the heads of poor
Mr. Roosevelt's liberals spin. Trust me. We have every detail pinpointed. Let me
show you where the new government will be located.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake stared at the plan and shook
his head. &quot;Some people will recognize what a pentagon means,&quot; he said
dubiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;They will be dismissed as
superstitious cranks. Believe me, this building will be constructed within a few
years. It will become the policeman of the world. Nobody will dare question its
actions or judgments without being denounced as a traitor. Within thirty years,
Mr. Drake, <i>within thirty years, </i>anyone who attempts to restore power to
the Congress will be cursed and vilified, not by liberals but by
conservatives.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Holy God,&quot; Drake said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The Grand Master rose and walked to
an old-fashioned globe nearly as large as King Kong's head. &quot;Pick a spot,
Mr. Drake. Any spot. I guarantee you we will have American troops there within
thirty years. The Empire that you dreamed of while reading Tacitus.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Robert Putney Drake felt humbled for
an instant,</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">even though he recognized the
gimmick: using one single example of telepathy, plucking Tacitus out of his
head, to climax the presentation of the incredible dream. At last he understood
firsthand the awe that the Illuminati created in both its servitors and its
enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;There will be opposition,&quot;
the Grand Master went on. &quot;In the 1960s and early 1970s especially. That's
where your notion for a unified crime syndicate fits into our plan. To crush the
opposition, we will need a Justice Department equivalent in many ways to
Hitler's Gestapo. If your scheme works—if<i> </i>the Mafia can be drawn into a
syndicate that is not entirely under Sicilian control, and the various other
groups can be brought under the same umbrella—we will have a nationwide outlaw
cartel. The public itself will then call for the kind of Justice Department that
we need. By the mid-1960s, wiretapping of all sorts must be so common that the
concept of privacy will be archaic.&quot; And, tossing sleeplessly, Drake
thought how smoothly it had all worked out; why then was he rebelling against
it? Why did it give him no pleasure? And what <i>was </i>it Jung had said about
power?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Richard Jung, wearing Carl Jung's old
sweater and smoking his pipe, said, &quot;And next the solar system.&quot; The
room was crowded with white rabbits, Playboy bunnies, Bugs Bunny, the Wolf Man,
Ku Kluxers, Ma-fiosos, Lepke with accusing eyes, a dormouse, a mad hatter, the
King of Hearts, the Prince of Wands, and Jung was shouting over the din.
&quot;Billions to reach the moon. Trillions to get to Mars. All pouring into our
corporations. Better than the gladiatorial games.&quot; Linda Lovelace elbowed
him aside. &quot;Call me Ishmaelian,&quot; she said suggestively; but Jung
handed Drake the skeleton of a Biafran baby. &quot;For Petruchio's feast,&quot;
he explained, producing a piece of ticker tape. &quot;We now own,&quot; he began
to read, &quot;seventy-two percent of earth's resources, and fifty-one percent
of all the armed troops in the world are under our direction. Here,&quot; he
said, passing the body of an infant that had died in Appalachia, &quot;see that
this one gets an apple in its mouth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A bunny passed Drake a 1923 Thompson
machine gun, the model that had been called an automatic rifle because the Army
had no funds to buy submachine guns that year. &quot;What's this for?&quot;
Drake asked, confused. &quot;We have to defend ourselves,&quot; the bunny said.
&quot;The mob is at the gates. The hungry mob. An astronaut named Spartacus is
leading them.&quot; Drake handed the gun to Maldonado and crept upstairs to his
private heliport. He passed through the lavatory to the laboratory (where Dr.
Frankenstein was attaching electrodes to Linda Lovelace's jaws) and entered the
golf course again, where the door opened to the airplane cabin.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He was escaping in his 747 jet, and
below he could see Black Panthers, college kids, starving coal miners, Indians,
Viet Cong, Brazilians, an enormous army pillaging his estate. &quot;They must
have seen the fnords,&quot; he said to the pilot. But the pilot was his mother
and the sight of her threw him into a rage. &quot;Leaving me alone!&quot; he
screamed. &quot;Always leaving me alone to go to your damned parties with
father. I never had a mother, just one nigger maid after another acting as
mothers. Were the parties that fucking important?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh,&quot; she said reddening,
&quot;how can you use that word in front of your own mother?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;To hell with that. All I
remember is your perfume hanging in the air, and some strange black face coming
when I called for you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You're such a baby,&quot; she
said sadly. &quot;All your life, you've always been a big baby.&quot; It was
true: he was wearing diapers. A vice president of Morgan Guarantee Trust stared
at him incredulously. &quot;I say, Drake, do you really think that is
appropriate garb for an important business meeting?&quot; Beside him Linda
Lovelace bent in ecstasy to kiss the secret ardor of Ishmael. &quot;A whale of a
good time,&quot; the vice president said, suddenly giggling inanely.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, fuck you all,&quot; Drake
screamed. &quot;I've got more money than any of you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The money is gone,&quot; Carl
Jung said, wearing</span></p>
<p>Freud's beard. &quot;What totem will you use now to ward off insecurity and
the things that go bump in the night?&quot; He sneered. &quot;What childish
codes! M.A.F.I.A.—<i>Morte Alla Francia Italia Anela. </i>French Canadian bean
soup—the Five Consecrated Bavarian Seers. <i>Annuit Coeptis Novus Or do
Seclorum—</i>Anti-Christ Now Our Savior. A boy has never wept nor dashed a
thousand kim—Asmodeus Belial Hastur Nyarlathotep Wotan Niggurath Dholes
Azathoth Tind-alos Kadith. Child's play! <i>Glasspielen!&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;Well, if you're so damned smart, who are the inner Five right
now?&quot; Drake asked testily.</p>
<p>&quot;Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Zeppo and Gummo,&quot; Jung said, riding off on
a tricycle. &quot;The Illuminati is your mother's breast, sucker,&quot; added
Albert Hoffman, peddling after Jung on a bicycle.</p>
<p>Drake awoke as the Eye closed. It was all clear in an instant, without the
labor he had spent working over the Dutchman's words. Maldonado stood by the
bedside, his face Karloff's, and said, &quot;We deserve to be dead.&quot; Yes:
that was what it was like when you discovered you were a robot, not a man, like
Karloff in the last scene of <i>Bride of Frankenstein.</i></p>
<p>Drake awoke again and this time he was really awake. It was clear, crystal
clear, and he had no regrets. Far away over Long Island Sound came the first
distant rumble of thunder, and he knew this was no storm that any scientist less
heretical than Jung or Wil-helm Reich would ever understand. &quot;Our
job,&quot; Huxley wrote before death, &quot;is waking up.&quot;</p>
<p>Drake put on his robe quickly and stepped out into the dark Elizabethan
hallway. Five hundred thousand dollars this house and grounds had cost,
including the cottages, and it was only one of his eight estates. Money. What
did it mean when Nyarlathotep appeared and &quot;the wild beasts followed him
and licked his hands&quot; as that damned stupid-smart Lovecraft wrote? What did
it matter when &quot;the blind idiot God Chaos blew earth's dust away&quot;?</p>
<p>Drake pushed open the dark paneled doorway of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">George's room. Good: Tarantella was gone. The thunder rumbled again, and
Drake's own shadow looming over the bed reminded him once more of a Karloff
movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He bent over the bed and shook
George's shoulder gently. &quot;Mavis,&quot; the boy said. Drake wondered who
the hell Mavis was; somebody terrific, obviously, if George could be dreaming
about her after a session with the Illuminati-trained Tarantella. Or was Mavis
another ex-Illuminatus? There were a lot of them with the Discordians lately,
Drake had surmised. He shook George's shoulder again, more vigorously.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Oh, no, I can't come
again,&quot; George said. Drake gave another shake, and two weary and frightened
eyes opened to look at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Up,&quot; Drake grunted,
grabbing George under the arms and pulling him to a sitting position. &quot;Out
of bed,&quot; he added, panting, rolling the boy to the edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake was looking through waves
upward at George. Damn it, the thing has already found my mind. &quot;You've got
to get out,&quot; he repeated. &quot;You're in danger here.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">October 23, 1935: Charley Workman,
Mendy Weiss and Jimmy the Shrew charge through the door of the Palace Chop House
and, according to orders, cowboy the joint</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">.
. . Lead pellets like rain; and rain like lead pellets hitting George's window,
&quot;Christ, what is it?&quot; he asked. Drake stood him up stark naked and
handed him his drawers, repeating &quot;Hurry!&quot; <i>Charley the Bug looked
over the three bodies: Abadaba Berman, Lulu Rosenkrantz and somebody he didn't
recognize. None of them was the Dutchman. &quot;My God, we fucked up,&quot; he
said, &quot;Dutch ain't here.&quot; </i>But a commotion has started in the
alleys of the dream: Albert Stern, taking his last fix of the night, suddenly
recalls his fantasy of killing somebody as important as John Dillinger. <i>&quot;The
can,&quot; Mendy Weiss says excitedly; he had a hard-on, like he always did on
this kind of job. </i>&quot;Man is a giant,&quot; Drake says, &quot;forced to
live in a pigmy's hut.&quot; &quot;What </span>does that mean?&quot; George
asks. &quot;It means we're all fools,&quot; Drake says excitedly, smelling the
old whore Death, &quot;especially those of us who try to act like giants by
bullying the others in the hut instead of knocking the goddam walls down. Carl
Jung told me that, only in more elegant language.&quot; George's dangling penis
kept catching his eye: homosexuality (an occasional thing with Drake),
heterosexuality (his normal state) and the new lust for the old whore Death were
all tugging at him. <i>The Dutchman dropped his penis, urine squirting his
shoes, and went for his gun as he heard the shots in the barroom. He turned
quickly, unable to stop pissing, and Albert Stern came through the door,
shooting before Dutch could take aim. Falling forward, he saw that it was really
Vince Coll, a ghost. &quot;Oh, mama mama mama,&quot; he said, lying in his
urine.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Which way do we go?&quot; George asked, buttoning his shirt.</p>
<p>&quot;You go,&quot; Drake said. &quot;Down the stairs and out the back, to
the garage. Here's the key to my Silver Wraith Rolls Royce. It won't be any use
to me anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why aren't you coming?&quot; George protested.</p>
<p>&quot;We deserve to be dead,&quot; Drake said, &quot;all of us in this
house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, that's crazy. I don't care what you've done, a guilt trip is
always crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've been on a crazier trip, as you'd call it, all my life,&quot; Drake
said calmly. &quot;The power trip. Now, <i>move!&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;George, don't make no bull moves,&quot; the Dutchman said.
&quot;He's talking,&quot; Sergeant Luke Conlon whispered at the foot of the
hospital bed; the police stenographer, F. J. Long, began taking notes.
&quot;What have you done with him?&quot; the Dutchman went on. &quot;Oh, mama,
mama, mama. Oh, stop it. Oh, oh, oh, sure. Sure, mama.&quot; </i>Drake sat down
in the window seat and, too nervous for a cigar, lit one of his infrequent
cigarettes. One hundred and fifty-seven, he thought, remembering the last entry
in his little notebook. One hundred and fifty-seven rich women, one wife, and
seventeen boys.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And never once did I really make
contact, never once did I smash the walls . . . The wind and the rain were now
deafening outside . . . Fourteen billion dollars, thirteen billion illegal and
tax-free; more than Getty or Hunt, even if I could never publicize the fact. And
that Arab boy in Tangier who picked my pocket after he blew me, my mother's
perfume, hours and hours in Zurich puzzling over the Dutchman's words.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Outside Flegenheimer's livery stable
in the Bronx, Phil Silverberg is teasing young Arthur Flegenheimer in 1913,
holding the burglar's tools out of reach, asking mockingly, &quot;Do you really
think you're big enough to knock over a house on your own?&quot; In the Newark
hospital, the Dutchman cries angrily, &quot;Now listen, Phil, fun is fun.&quot;
The seventeen Illuminati representatives vanished in the dark; the one with the
goat's head suddenly returned. &quot;What happened to the other sixteen?&quot;
Dutch asked the hospital walls. The blood from his arm signed the parchment.
&quot;Oh, he done it. Please,&quot; he asked vaguely. Sergeant Conlon looks
bemusedly at the stenographer, Lang. <i>The lightning seemed dark, and the
darkness seemed light. It's taking hold of my mind completely, Drake thought,
sitting by the window.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I will hold onto my sanity, Drake
swore silently. What was that rock song about Jesus I was remembering?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Only five inches between me and
happiness,&quot; was it? No, that's from <i>Deep Throat. </i>The whiteness of
the whale.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The waves covered his vision again:
wrong song, obviously. I have to reach him, to unify the forces. No, dammit,
that's not <i>my </i>thought. That's his thought. He's coming up, up out of the
waves. I must rise. I must rise. To unify the forces.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Dillinger said, &quot;You're right,
Dutch. Fuck the Illuminati. Fuck the Maf. The Justified Ancients of Mummu would
be glad to have you.&quot; The Dutchman looked right into Sergeant Conlon's eyes
and asked, &quot;John, please, oh, did you buy the whole tale? You promised a
million, sure. Get out, I wished I knew.</span></p>
<p>Please make it quick. Fast and furious. Please. Fast and furious. Please help
me get out.&quot;</p>
<p>I should have gotten out in '42, when I first learned about the camps, Drake
thought. I never realized until then that they really meant to do it. And next
Hiroshima. Why did I stay after Hiroshima? It was so obvious, it was just the
way Lovecraft wrote, the idiot God Chaos blew earth's dust away, and back in '35
I knew the secret: if a cheap hoodlum like Dutch Schultz had a great poet buried
in him, what might be released if any man looked the old whore Death in the eye?
Say that I betrayed my country and my planet, but worse, add that I betrayed
Robert Putney Drake, the giant of psychology I murdered when I used the secret
for power and not for healing.</p>
<p>I see the plumbers, the cesspool cleaners, the colorless all-color of
atheism. I am the Fate's lieutenant: I act under ardors. White, White void.
Ahab's eye. Five inches from happiness, the Law of Fives, always. Ahab schlurped
down, down.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bavarian stuff is all bullshit,&quot; Dillinger said.
&quot;They're mostly Englishmen, since Rhodes took command in 1888. And they've
already infiltrated Justice, State and Labor, as well as the Treasury. That's
who you're playing ball with. And let me tell you what they plan to do with your
people, the Jews, in this war they're cooking up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; the Dutchman interrupted. &quot;Capone would have a
bullet in me if he knew I was even talking to you, John.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you afraid of Capone? He arranged to have the Feds put a bullet in
me at the Biograph and I'm still sassy and lively as ever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not afraid of Capone or Lepke or Maldonado or . . .&quot; The
Dutchman's eyes brought back the hospital room. &quot;I'm a pretty good
pretzlcr,&quot; he told Sergeant Conlon anxiously. &quot;Winifred, Department of
Justice. I even got it from the department.&quot; The pain shot through him,
sharp as ecstasy. &quot;Sir, please stop it!&quot; He had to explain about
DeMolay and Weishaupt. &quot;Lis<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">ten,&quot;
he urged, &quot;the last Knight. I don't want to holler.&quot; It was so hard,
with the pulsings of the pain. &quot;I don't know, sir. Honestly, I don't. I
went to the toilet. I was in the can and the boy came at me. If we wanted to
break the Ring. No, please. I get a month. Come on, Illuminati, cut me
off.&quot; It was so hard to explain. &quot;I had nothing with him and he was a
cowboy in one of the seven days. <i>Ewige! </i>Fight... No business, no
hangouts, no friends. Nothing. Just what you pick up and what you need.&quot;
The pain wasn't just the bullet; they were working on his mind, trying to stop
him from saying too much. He saw the goat head. &quot;Let him harness himself to
you and then bother you,&quot; he cried. &quot;They are Englishmen and they are
a type and I don't know who is best, they or us.&quot; So much to say, and so
little time. He thought of Francie, his wife. &quot;Oh, sir, get the doll a
rofting.&quot; The Illuminati formula to summon the lloigor: he could at least
reveal that. &quot;A boy has never wept nor dashed a thousand kim. Did you hear
me?&quot; They had to understand how high it went, all over the world. &quot;I
would hear it, the Circuit Court would hear it, and the Supreme Court would hear
it. If that ain't the payoff. Please crack down on the Chinaman's friends and
Hitler's Commander.&quot; Eris, the Great Mother, was the only alternative to
the Illuminati's power; he had to tell them that much. &quot;Mother is the best
bet and don't let Satan draw you too fast.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;He's blabbing too much,&quot;
the one who wore the goat head, Winifred, from Washington, said. &quot;Increase
the pain.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The dirty rats have tuned
in,&quot; Dutch shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Control yourself,&quot;
Sergeant Conlon said soothingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;But I am dying,&quot; Dutch,
explained. Couldn't they understand anything?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Drake met Winifred at a cocktail
party in Washington, in '47, just after the National Security Act was passed by
the Senate. &quot;Well?&quot; Winifred asked, &quot;do you have any further
doubts?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;None at all,&quot; Drake said.
&quot;All my open money is now invested in defense industries.&quot;</span></p>
<p>&quot;Keep it there,&quot; Winifred smiled, &quot;and you'll get richer than
you ever dreamed. Our present projection is that we can get Congress to approve <i>one
trillion dollars </i>in war preparations before 1967.&quot;</p>
<p>Drake thought fast and asked softly, &quot;You're going to add another
villain beside Russia?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watch China,&quot; Winifred said calmly.</p>
<p>For once, curiosity surpassed cupidity in Drake; he asked, &quot;Are you
really keeping <i>him </i>in the Pentagon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you like to meet him, face to face?&quot; Winifred asked with a
faint hint of a sneer in his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;No thank you,&quot; Drake said coolly. &quot;I've been reading Herman
Rauschning. I remember Hitler's words about the Superman: 'He is alive, among
us. I have met him. He is intrepid and terrible. I was afraid of him.' That's
enough for my curiosity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hitler,&quot; Winifred replied, not hiding the sneer now. &quot;Saw him
in his more human form. He's . . . progressed ... since then.&quot;</p>
<p>Tonight, Drake thought, as the thunder rose to a maddening crescendo, I will
see him, or one of them. Surely, I could have picked a more agreeable form of
suicide? The question was pointless; Jung had been right all along, with his Law
of Opposites. Even Freud knew it: every sadist becomes a masochist at last.</p>
<p>On an impulse, Drake arose and fetched a pad and pen from the bedside Tudor
table. He began to scribble by the light of the increasing electrical storrn
outside:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I afraid of? Haven't I been building up to this rendezvous ever since
I threw the bottle at mother when I was 1 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.5pt">1/2</span><i> </i>years old?</p>
<p>And it is kin to me. We both live on blood, do we not, even if I have
prettied it over by taking the blood money instead of the blood itself?</p>
<p>Dimensions keep shifting, whenever it gets a fix on me. Prinn was right in
his <i>De Vermis Mysteriis, </i>they don't really participate in the same
space-time as us. That's what Alhazred meant when he wrote, &quot;Their hand is
at your throat but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">you see them not.
They walk serene and unsuspected, not in the spaces we know, but between
them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Pull me out,&quot; the Dutchman
moaned. &quot;I am half crazy. They won't let me get up. They dyed my shoes.
Give me something. I am so sick.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I can see Kadath and the two magnetic
poles. I must unify the forces by eating the entity.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Which me is the real me? Is it so
easy to flow into my soul because there is so little soul left? Is that what
Jung was trying to tell me about power?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I see Newark Hospital and the
Dutchman. I see the white light and then the black that does not pulsate or
move. I see George trying to drive the Rolls in this damnable rain. I see the
whiteness of whiteness is black.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Anybody,&quot; the Dutchman
pleaded, &quot;kindly take my shoes off. No, there's a handcuff on them. The
Baron says these things.&quot;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I see Weishaupt and the Iron Boot. No
wonder only five ever withstand the ordeal to become the top of the pyramid.
Baron Rothschild won't let Rhodes get away with that. What is time or space,
anyway? What is soul, that we claim to judge it? Which is real—the boy Arthur
Flegenheimer, seeking for his mother, the gangster Dutch Schultz, dealing in
murder and corruption with the cool of a Medici or a Morgan, or the mad poet
being born in the Newark hospital bed as the others die?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">And Elizabeth was a bitch. They sang
&quot;The Golden Vanity&quot; about Raleigh, but none could speak a word against
me. Yet he received the preference. The Globe Theatre, new drama by Will
Shakespeare, down the street they torture Sackerson the bear for sport.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Christ, they opened the San Andreas
Fault to </span>hide the most important records about Norton. Sidewalks opening
like mouths, John Barrymore falling out of bed, Will Shakespeare in his mind, my
mind, Sir Francis's mind. Roderick Usher. Starry Wisdom, they called it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The sidewalk was in trouble,&quot; the Dutchman tried to explain,
&quot;and the bears were in trouble and I broke it up. Please put me in that
room. Please keep him in control.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can hear it! The very sounds recorded by Poe and Lovecraft: Tekeli-li,
tekeli-li! It must be close.</p>
<p>I didn't mean to throw the bottle, mother. I just wanted your attention. I
just wanted attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,' the Dutchman sighed. &quot;Okay, I am all through. Can't do
another thing. Look out, mama, look out for her. You can't beat Him. Police.
Mama. Helen. Mother. Please take me out.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see it and it can see me. In the dark. There are things worse than
death, vivisections of the spirit. I should run. Why do I sit here? The bicycle
and the tricycle. 23 skiddoo. Inside the pentagon, the cold of interstellar
space. They came from the stars and brought their images with them. Mother. I'm
sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, open the soap duckets,&quot; the Dutchman said hopelessly.
&quot;The chimney sweeps. Take to the sword.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is like a chimney without end. Up and up forever, in deeper and deeper
darkness. And the red all-seeing eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Please help me up. French Canadian bean soup. I want to pay. Let them
leave me alone.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">I want to join it. I want to become
it. I have no more will of my own. I take thee, old whore Death, as my lawful
wedded wife. I am mad. I am half mad. Mother. The bottle. Linda, schlurped,
sucked down.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Unity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A nine-year-old girl named Patty
Cohen lived three miles down the coast from the Drake estate, and she went mad
in those early morning hours of April 25. At first, her parents thought she had
gotten hold of some of the LSD which was known to be infiltrating the local
grammar school and, being fairly hip, they fed her niacin and horse doctor's
doses of vitamin C as she ran about the house alternately laughing and making
faces at them, howling about &quot;he's laying in his own piss&quot; and
&quot;he's still alive inside it&quot; and &quot;Roderick Usher.&quot; By
morning they knew it was more than acid, and months of sadness began as they
took her to clinics and private psychiatrists</span><span style="font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">and
more clinics and more private psychiatrists. Finally, just before Chanukah in
December, they took her to an elegant shrink on Park Avenue, and she had a
virtual epileptic fit in the waiting room, staring at a statue on the end table
and screaming, &quot;Don't let him eat me! Don't let him eat me!&quot; Her
recovery began from that day, and the sight of that miniature representation of
the giant Tlaloc in Mexico City.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But three hours after Drake's death,
George Dorn lay on his bed in the Hotel Tudor, holding a phone to his ear,
listening to it ring. A young woman's voice on the other end suddenly said
hello.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I'd like to speak to Inspector
Goodman,&quot; said George.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There was a momentary pause, then the
voice said, &quot;Who's calling, please?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;My name is George Dorn, but it
probably wouldn't mean anything to the Inspector. But would you ask him to come
to the phone please and tell him I have a message for him about the case of
Joseph Malik.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There was a constricted silence, as
if the woman on the other end of the phone wanted to scream and had stopped
breathing. Finally she said, &quot;My husband is working just now, but I'll be
glad to give him any message you have.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;That's funny,&quot; said
George. &quot;I've been told Inspector Goodman's duty hours are noon to 9
P.M.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I don't think it's any of your
business where he is,&quot; the woman suddenly blurted. George felt a little
shock. Rebecca Goodman was frightened and she didn't know where her husband was:
something in the tone of her last three words revealed her mental state to
George. I must be getting more sensitive to people, he thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Do you ever hear from
him?&quot; he said gently. He was feeling sorry for Mrs. Inspector Saul Goodman,
who was, come to think of it, the wife of a pig. If, just a few years ago,
George had read in the paper that this woman's husband had been shot down at
random by some unknown revolutionary-type assailants, he would probably have
whispered, &quot;Right on.&quot; One of George's own friends of that period
might have killed Inspector Goodman. There was even a moment when George himself
might have done it. Once, one of the kids in George's group had called up the
young widow of a policeman killed one December by young blacks and called her a
bitch and the wife of a pig and told her that her husband was guilty of crimes
against the people and that those who had shot him would go down in history as
heroes. George had approved of this verbal action as a means of hardening
oneself against bourgeois sentimentality. The papers had been 'full of stories
about how this policeman's three little kids would have no Christmas this year;
such tripe made George urgently want to throw up.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">But now this woman's anguish was
coursing through the wire and he was feeling it, just because her hus-band was
not known to be dead, just missing. And probably not dead at all; otherwise why
would! Hagbard have said that George should get in touch with him?</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I—I don't know what you
mean,&quot; she said. She was starting to break, George thought. In another
minute she'd be blurting out all her fears to him. Well, for Christ's sake, <i>he
</i>didn't know where Goodman was.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Look,&quot; he said sharply,
pushing back against the flow of emotion coming through to him, &quot;if you
hear from Inspector Goodman, tell him if he wants to know more about the
Bavarian Illuminati he should call George Dorn at the Hotel Tudor. That's
D-O-R-N, Hotel <i>Tudor. </i>Have you got that?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The Illuminati! Look, uh, Mr.
Dorn, whatever you want to tell, you can tell me. I'll pass it on to nun.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I can't do that, Mrs. Goodman.
Thank you, now. Good-bye.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Wait! Don't hang up.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I can't help you, Mrs. Goodman.
I don't know where he is, either.&quot; George dropped the phone into its cradle
with a sigh. His hands were cold and moist. Well, he'd have to tell Hagbard he
couldn't reach Inspector Goodman. But he had learned something—that Saul
Goodman, who was supposed to be investigating Joe Malik's disappearance, had
himself disappeared, and the words &quot;Bavarian Illuminati&quot; meant
something to his wife. George crossed the small room and turned on the TV. The
noon news would be on. He went back to his bed, lay down and lit a cigarette. He
was still exhausted, from his sexual bout of the night before with Tarantella
Serpentine.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The announcer said, &quot;The
Attorney General has announced that he will speak at six this evening on the
early morning epidemic of gangland-style assassinations at widely separated
locations all over the country. The death toll from killings of this type has
reached twenty-seven, though, local officials refuse to say whether all—or
any—of these deaths are connected. Among those shot are Senator Edward Coke
Bacon; two high-ranking Los Angeles police officers; the mayor of a town called
Mad Dog, Texas; a New York fight promoter; a Boston pharmacist; a Detroit
ceramicist; a Chicago Communist; three New Mexico hippie leaders; a New Orleans
restaurateur; a barber in Yorba Linda, California; and a sausage manufacturer in
She-boygan, Wisconsin. There were bomb explosions at fifteen locations, killing
thirteen more people. Six persons around the country have disappeared, and four
of these were seen being forced into cars at different times last night and this
morning. The Attorney General today called this 'a reign of terror perpetrated
by organized crime,' pointing out that though the motives for the widely
scattered slayings is obscure they bear the earmarks of gangster killings.
However, new FBI director 3eorge Wallace, who has ordered FBI agents around the
country into action, issued a written statement declaring—quote—'Once again
the Attorney General has treed the wrong coon, proving that law enforcement
should be left to the experienced professionals. We have reason to think that
these murders are the work of Negro Communists directed from Peking.'—end of
quote. Meanwhile, the office of the Vice President has issued an apology to the
Italian-American Anti-Defamation League for his reference to 'Mafioso rubouts'
and the League has withdrawn its picket line from the White House. Remember, the
Attorney General will address the nation at 6 P.M. tonight.&quot; The announcer
suddenly changed his facial expression from neutral newscaster to pugnacious
patriot. &quot;Certain dissident elements keep complaining that people don't get
a chance to participate in decisions made by their government. Yet, at a time
like this, when the whole nation has an opportunity to hear the Attorney
General, the ratings are not always as good as they should be. So let's do
everything we can to build up those ratings tonight, and let the whole world
know that this is still a democracy.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Fuck!&quot; George shouted at
the screen. He didn't recall TV newscasters being that obnoxious. Must be a
fairly recent development, something that had happened after he left for Mad
Dog—maybe a late outgrowth of the Fernando Poo crisis. It was in this very
hotel, George remembered, just after the bloody Fer-</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">nando Poo demonstrations at the UN
that Joe Malik had first broached the subject of Mad Dog. Now Joe had
disappeared, not unlike those people who, as George knew, the Syndicate had
snuffed in earnest of their good intentions, having accepted Hagbard's gift of
objets d'art. Not unlike Inspector Saul Goodman who perhaps had gone down the
same rabbit hole as Joe.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">There was a knock at the door. George
went to it, turning off the TV set in passing. It was Stella Maris.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Well, glad to see you, baby.
Strip off that dress and come over to the bed, so we can reaffirm my initiation
rites.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Stella put her hands on his
shoulders. &quot;Never mind that now, George. We've got things to worry about
Robert Putney Drake and Banana Nose Maldonado are dead. Come on. We've got to
get back to Hagbard right away.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Traveling first by helicopter, then
by executive jet and finally by motorboat to Hagbard's Chesapeake Bay submarine
base, George was exhausted and dazed in terror's aftermath. He rallied when he
saw Hagbard again.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You motherfucker! You sent me
to get goddam killed!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;And that has given you the
courage to tell me off,&quot; said Hagbard with an indulgent smile. &quot;Fear
is a funny thing, isn't it, George? If we weren't afraid of dying of diseases,
we'd never develop the science of microbiology. That science in turn creates the
possibility of germ warfare. And each superpower is so afraid that the others
may wage germ warfare against it, each develops its own plagues to wipe out the
human race.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Your mind is wandering, you
stupid old fart,&quot; said Stella. &quot;George isn't kidding about nearly
being killed.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;The fear of death is the
beginning of slavery,&quot; Hagbard said simply.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Even though it was early, George
found himself on the verge of collapse, ready to sleep for twenty-four hours or
more. The submarine's engines vibrated under</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">his feet as he trudged to his cabin,
but he wasn't even curious about where they were going. He lay down on his bed,
and picked a book off the headpost bookshelf, part of his
getting-ready-for-sleep ritual. <i>Sexuality, Magic and Perversion </i>said the
binder. Well, that sounded juicy and promising. Author named Francis King,
whoever that is. Citadel Press, 1972. Only a few years ago. Well, then. George
opened at random:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Within a few years Prater Paragranus
had become Chief of the Swiss section of the OTO, had entered into friendly
relationships with the disciples of Aleister Crowley—notably Karl Germer
—and had established a magazine. Subsequently Prater Paragranus inherited the
chieftainship of Krumm-Heller's Ancient Rosicrucian Fraternity and the
Patriarchate of the Gnostic Catholic Church—this latter dignity he derived
from Chevillon, murdered by the Gestapo in 1944, who was himself the successor
of Johnny Bricaud. Prater Paragranus is also the head of one of the several
groups who claim to be the true heirs and successors of the Illuminati of
Weishaupt as revived (circa 1895) by Leopold Engd.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">George blinked. <i>Several </i>Illuminati?
He had to ask Hagbard about this. But he was already beginning to visualize into
hypnogogic revery and sleep was coming.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">In less than a half-hour, Joe had
distributed ninety-two paper cups of tomato juice containing AUM, the drug that
promised to turn neophobes into neophiles. He stood in Pioneer Court, just north
of the Michigan Avenue Bridge, at a table from which hung a poster reading FREE
TOMATO JUICE. Each person who took a cupful was invited to fill out a short
questionnaire and leave it in a box on Joe's table. However, Joe explained, the
questionnaire was optional, and anyone who wanted to drink the tomato juice and
run was welcome to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">AUM would work just as well either
way, but the questionnaire would give ELF an opportunity to trace its effect on
some of the subjects.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A tall black policeman was suddenly
standing in front of the table. &quot;You got a permit for this?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;You bet,&quot; said Joe with a
quick smile. &quot;I'm with the General Services Corporation, and we're running
a test on a new brand of tomato juice. Care to try some, officer?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No thanks,&quot; said the cop
unsmilingly. &quot;We had a bunch of yippies threatening to put LSD in the
city's water supply two years ago. Let's just see your credentials.&quot; There
was something cold, hard and homicidal in this cop's eyes, Joe thought Something
beyond the ordinary. This would be a unique guy, and the stuff would affect him
uniquely. Joe looked down at the nameplate on the policeman's jacket, which read
WATERHOUSE. The line behind Patrolman Waterhouse was getting longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Joe found the paper Malaclypse had
given him. He handed it to Waterhouse, who glanced at it and said, &quot;This
isn't enough. You apparently didn't tell them you were going to set up your
stand in Pioneer Court You're blocking pedestrian traffic here. This is a busy
area. You'll have to move.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Joe looked out at the street where
crowds walked back and forth, at the bridge across the green, greasy Chicago
river and at the buildings surrounding Pioneer Court. The brick-paved area was
an ample public square, and there was clearly room for everyone. Joe smiled at
Waterhouse. He was in Chicago and knew what to do. He took a ten-dollar bill out
of his pocket, folded it twice lengthwise and wrapped it around a cup of the
tomato juice, which he deftly filled from the plastic jug on his table.
Waterhouse drained the tomato juice without comment, and when he tossed the cup
into the wastebasket the ten-dollar bill was gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">A bunch of baldheaded, cackling
small-town businessman types was lined up in front of the table. Each one wore
an acetate-covered badge bearing a red</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt"> </span>Crusaders' cross, the letters KCUF and the
words, &quot;Dominus Vobiscum! My name is ———— .&quot; Joe smilingly
handed them cups of tomato juice, noting that the lapels of several bore an
additional decoration, a square white plastic cross with the letters CL printed
across it. Any of these men, Joe knew, would love to put him in jail for the
rest of his life because he was the publisher of a radical magazine that
occasionally got very explicit about sex and several times had published what
Joe considered very beautiful erotica. The Knights of Christianity United for
the Faith were rumored to be behind the firebombing of two theaters in the
Midwest and the lynching of a news dealer in Alabama. And, of course, they had
close ties with Atlanta Hope's God's Lightning Party.</p>
<p>AUM would be strong medicine for this bunch, Joe thought. He wondered if it
would get them off their censorship kick or just make them more formidable. In
either case, they would be bound to bust loose from II-uminati control for a
time. If only there were a way he and Simon could get into their convention and
administer AUM to more of them . . .</p>
<p>Behind the KCUF contingent there was a small man who looked like a rooster
with a gray comb. When Joe read the questionnaire later, he found out that he
had administered AUM to Judge Caligula Bushman a shining ornament of the Chicago
judiciary.</p>
<p>There followed a succession of faces Joe did not find memorable. They all had
that complex, stupid, shrewd, angry, defeated, cynical, gullible look
characteristic of Chicago, New York and other big cities. Then he found himself
confronting a tall redhead whose features seemed to combine the best of
Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe. &quot;Any vodka in that?&quot; she asked
him.</p>
<p>&quot;No, ma'am, just straight tomato juice,&quot; said Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Too bad,&quot; she said as she tossed it down.&quot; &quot;I could use
one.&quot;</p>
<p>Caligula Bushman, known as the toughest judge on the Chicago bench, was
trying six people who were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">charged with
attacking a draft board, destroying all its furniture, ruining its files and
dumping a wheelbarrow full of cow manure on the floor. Suddenly Bushman
interrupted the trial about halfway through the prosecution's presentation of
its case with the announcement that he was going to hold a sanity hearing. To
the bewilderment of all, he then asked State's Attorney Milo A. Flanagan a
series of rather odd questions:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What would you think of a man
who not only kept an arsenal in his home, but was collecting at enormous
financial sacrifice a second arsenal to protect the first one? What would you
say if this man so frightened his neighbors that they in turn were collecting
weapons to protect themselves from him? What if this man spent ten times as much
money on his expensive weapons as he did on the education of his children? What
if one of his children criticized his hobby and he called that child a traitor
and a bum and disowned it? And he took another child who had obeyed him
faithfully and armed that child and sent it out into the world to attack
neighbors? What would you say about a man who introduces poisons into the water
he drinks and the air he breathes? What if this man not only is feuding with the
people on his block but involves himself in the quarrels of others in distant
parts of the city and even in the suburbs? Such a man would clearly be a
paranoid schizophrenic, Mr. Flanagan, with homicidal tendencies. This is the man
who should be on trial, though under our modern, enlightened system of
jurisprudence we would attempt to cure and rehabilitate him rather than merely
punish.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Speaking as a judge,&quot; he
continued, &quot;I dismiss this case on several grounds. The State is clinically
insane as a corporate entity and is absolutely unfit to arrest, try and
incarcerate those who disagree with its policies. But I doubt that this
judgment, though obvious to any man of common sense, quite fits into the rules
of our American jurisprudential game. I also rule, therefore, that the right to
destroy government property is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution and therefore the crime with which these people are charged is not
a crime under the Constitution. Government property belongs to all of the
people, and the right of any of the people to express displeasure with their
government by destroying government property is precious and shall not be
infringed.&quot; This doctrine had come to Judge Bushman suddenly while he was
speaking without his robe. It startled him, but he had noticed that his mind was
working better and faster this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">He went on, &quot;The State does not
exist as a person or thing exists, but is a legal fiction. A fiction is a form
of communication. Anything said to be owned by a form of communication must also
thereby be itself a form of communication. Government is a map and government
paper is a map of the map. The medium, in this case, is definitely the message,
as any semanticist would agree. Furthermore, any physical act directed against a
communication is itself a communication, a map of the map of the map. Thus,
destruction of government property is protected by the First Amendment. I will
issue a more ample written opinion on this point, but I feel now that the
defendants need suffer in durance no longer. Case dismissed.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Many spectators trooped out of the
courtroom sullenly, while those who loved the defendants surrounded them with
tears, laughter and hugs. Judge Bushman, who stepped down from the bench but
remained in the courtroom, was the benign center of a cluster of reporters. (He
was thinking that his opinion would be a map of the map of the map of the map,
or a fourth-order map. How many potential further orders of symbolism were
there? He barely heard the praises showered on him. Of course, he knew his
decision would be overturned; but the judge business already bored him. It would
be interesting to get into mathematics, really <i>deep.)</i></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Harold Canvera had not bothered to
fill out a questionnaire and therefore was not under observation and </span>was
not protected. He returned to his home, and his job as an accountant, and his
avocation, which was recording telephone spiels against the Illuminati, the
Communists, the Socialists, the Liberals, the Middle-of-the-Roaders and all
insufficiently conservative Republicans. (Mr. Canvera also mailed out similar
pamphlets whenever anybody was intrigued enough by his phone messages to send
him twenty-five cents for additional information. He performed these worthy
educational services for a group calling itself White Heroes Opposing Red
Extremism, which was a splinter off Taxpayers Warring Against Tyranny, which was
a splinter off God's Lightning.) In the following weeks, however, strange new
ideas began to appear in Canvera's taped phone messages.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Lower </i>taxes aren't enough,&quot; he said, for instance.
&quot;When you hear some so-called conservative Bircher or some follower of
William Buckley Jr. call for lower taxes, <i>beware. </i>There's a man who's <i>squishy
soft </i>on IIluminism. All taxes are robbery. Instead of attacking Joan Baez, a
real American should support her for refusing to pay any more money into the
Illuminati treasury in Washington.&quot;</p>
<p>The next week was even more interesting: &quot;White Heroes Opposing Red
Extremism has often told you that there's no real difference between the
Democrats and Republicans. Both are pawns of the Illuminati scheme to destroy
private property and make everybody a slave of the State, so the International
Bankers <i>of a certain minority group </i>can run everything. Now it's time for
all thinking patriots to take an even more skeptical look than ever before at
the so-called anti-Il-luminati John Birch Society. Why are they always putting
up those stickers saying, 'Support Your Local Police'? Ever wonder about that?
What's the most important thing to a police state? Isn't it police? And if we
got rid of the police, how could we ever have a police state? Think about it,
fellow Americans, and Remember the Alamo!&quot;</p>
<p>A few of these new strange ideas had come from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">various right-wing anarchist periodicals (all secretly subsidized by
Hagbard Celine) that Canvera had mysteriously received three months earlier and
hadn't glanced at until swallowing the AUM. The periodicals had been mailed by
Simon Moon, as a joke, in an envelope with the return address Illuminati
International, 34 East 68th Street, New York City—the headquarters of the
Council on Foreign Relations, long regarded by the Birchers as an Illuminati
hotbed. &quot;Remember the Alamo,&quot; Canvera had picked up from <i>Bowie
Knife, </i>a publication of the Davy Crockett Society, a paramilitary right-wing
fascist group which had splintered off God's Lightning when their leader, a
Texas oil millionaire of gigantic paranoias, became convinced that many apparent
Mexicans were actually Red Chinese agents in slight disguise. Later, the dogma
became retroactive and he claimed that the Chinese had always been Communists, <i>all
</i>Mexicans had always been Chinese, and the attack on the Alamo was the first
Communist assault against American capitalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The third week was quite remarkable.
Evidently, AUM, like LSD, changed some personality traits but left others fairly
intact; in any event, in Canvera's irregular evolution from right-wing
authoritarianism to right-wing libertarianism, he had somehow managed to arrive
at a thesis never before enunciated except by Donatien Alphonse Francois de
Sade. What this rare man did was to give a three-minute spiel in favor of the
right of any person, of either sex, to use any other person, of either sex, <i>with
or without </i>their consent, for sexual gratification of any sort needed or at
least <i>desired. </i>The only option he granted the recipients of these
intimate invasions was the reciprocal right to use the initiator for their own
needs or desires. Now, most of the people who regularly called Canvera's phone
service were not offended by any of this; they were Lincoln Avenue hippies and
dialed him only when stoned, for what they called &quot;a really weird and
far-out head trip,&quot; and they were bored that he was no longer </span>as
funky as in his old Negro-baiting, Jew-hating and II-luminati-castigating days.
However, there were a few members of White Heroes Opposing Red Extremism who
called occasionally to check that their contributions were still financing the
dissemination of true Americanism, and these people were severely puzzled and
finally disturbed. Some of them even wrote to WHORE headquarters in Mad Dog,
Texas, to complain that there was something a little bit peculiar in the
Americanism lately. However, the president of WHORE, Dr. Horace Naismith, who
also ran the John Dillinger Died for You Society, Veterans of the Sexual
Revolution, and the Colossus of Yorba Linda Foundation, was in it only for the
money, sad to say, and had no time for such petty complaints. He was too busy
implementing his newest fund-raising scheme, the Male Chauvinist Organization
(MACHO), which he hoped would milk <i>mucho </i>denaros from Russ Meyers,
illegal abortionists, pimps, industrialists who regularly paid female workers
thirty percent of the salaries of men doing the same jobs, and all others
threatened by the Women's Liberation Movement.</p>
<p>The fourth week was, to be frank about it, definitely bizarre. Canvera
discoursed at length on the lost civilization that once existed in the Gobi
Desert and denounced those, such as Brion Gysin, who believed it had destroyed
itself in atomic war. Rather, he asserted, it had been obliterated when the
Illuminati arrived from the planet Vulcan in flying saucers. &quot;Remember the
Alamo&quot; was now replaced by &quot;Remember Carcosa,&quot; Canvera having
discerned that both Ambrose Bierce and H. P. Lovecraft were describing this
tragic Gobian society in their fiction. The hippies were again delighted—this
was the funky kind of trip that had originally made Canvera a mock folk hero
among them—and they especially appreciated his call for the U.S. to abandon
the next moon shot and launch a punitive expedition to Vulcan both to wipe out
Illuminism at its source and to avenge poor Carcosa. The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">WHORE
regulars, however, were again upset; all that concern with Carcosa struck them
as creeping one-worldism.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">The fifth week, Canvera took a new
turn, denouncing the masses for their stupidity and proclaiming that the boobs
probably deserved being governed by the Illuminati since most of them were too
dumb to find their own behinds in a dark room even using both hands. He had been
browsing through a volume of H. L. Mencken (sent to him over a year earlier by
El Haj Stackerlee Mohammed, ne Pearson, after one of his
put-prayers-back-in-the-public-schools tirades); but he had also been pondering
an invitation to <i>join </i>the Illuminati. This document, which came in an
envelope with no return address, informed him that he was too smart to stay with
the losers all his life and ought to climb on the winning side before it was too
late. It added that membership dues were $3125, which should be put in a cigar
box and buried in his back yard, after which it promised &quot;one of our
underground agents will contact you.&quot; At first, Canvera had considered this
a hoax—he received many put-ons in the mail, together with pornography,
Rosicrucian pamphlets, illustrated with the eye-and-pyramid design, and
pretended fan letters signed by such names as <i>Eldridge Cleaver, Fidel Castro,
Anton Szandor Levay </i>or <i>Judge Crater, </i>all of course cooked up by his
Lincoln Avenue audience. Later, however, it struck him that 3125 was <i>five to
the fifth power </i>and that convinced him a True Illuminatus was indeed
communicating with him. He took the $3125 out of his savings account, buried it
as instructed, made a pro-Illuminati recording as a gesture of good faith and
waited. The next day he was shot, several times, in the head and shoulders,
dying of natural causes as a result.</span></p>
<p><i>(In present time again, Rebecca Goodman enters the Hotel Tudor lobby in
answer to the second mysterious phone call of the day, while Hagbard decides
George Dorn needs to be illuminized further before Ingolstadt, and Esperando
Despond clears his throat and says, &quot;I want to explain the mathematics of
plague to you men . . </i>.&quot;)</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Actually, poor old Canvera's death
had nothing to do with the Illuminati or with his former compatriots in WHORE.
The man had been practicing the libertine philosophy of his post-AUM phone
editorials and had tampered with Cassandra Acconci, the beloved daughter of
Ronald Acconci, Chicago Regional Commander of God's Lightning and a long-time

cartography and topology. Although he was a religious fanatic (as I was at the

Dr. Horace Naismith collided in front of the door of the Sands Hotel
(&quot;Watch the fuck where you're going,&quot; Carmel growled), </i>and she was
at the door, her heart was pounding, an intuition was forming in her mind, and
she knocked <i>(and Peter Jackson began dialing Epicene Wildeblood), </i>and she
was sure of it, and she was afraid of being sure because she might be wrong, <i>and
the Midget said to Dr. Naismith &quot;Rude bastard, wasn't he?&quot; </i>and the
door opened, <i>and the door of Milo O. Flanagan's office opened to admit

closed the door behind her and drew her further into the room. &quot;I'm not a

<p><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;What?&quot; </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Rebecca

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I wanted sex with my father,

think. Just before my first period. My God, you must have been a lot further

what the ancients called wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;I've always had a thing about
black women, just like your thing about black men,&quot; he went on. &quot;I
think everybody in this country has a touch of it. The blacks have it about <i>us,
</i>too. I was in one head, a brilliant black guy, musician, scientist, poet, a
million talents, and white women were like the Holy Grail to him. And your
fantasy about Spiro Agnew—I had one just like that about Ilse Koch, a Nazi
bitch from before your time. It was the same thing in both cases, revenge. Not
real sex, hate-sex. Oh, we're all so crazy-in-the-head.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Rebecca backed up and sat down on the
bed. &quot;It's too much, too fast, I'm scared. I can see you don't have any
contempt for me, but, Lord, can I <i>live </i>knowing that somebody else knows
every single repressed desire I have?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Yes,&quot; Saul said calmly.
&quot;And you're mistaken about Tune. I can't know every secret, darling. I've
only had a smattering of them. A handful. There are a dozen people right now
who've been through my head the same way, and I can look any one of them in the
eye. The things I know about <i>them!&quot; </i>He laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;It's still too fast,&quot;
Rebecca said. &quot;You disappear, and then you come back knowing thongs about
me that I only half know myself, and you're not a cop anymore . . . What do you
mean, you've joined 'the other side'? The Mafia? The Morituri groups?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;No,&quot; Saul answered
happily. &quot;Much further out than that. Darling, I've been driven mad by the
world's best brainwashers and put back together again by a computer that does
psychotherapy, predicts the future and steers a submarine all at once. On the
way, I learned things about humanity and the universe that it would take a year
to tell you. And I don't have much time right now, because I've got to fly to
Las Vegas. In two or three days, if everything works out, I'll be able to show
you, not just tell you—&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;Are you reading my mind right
now?&quot; Rebecca asked, still awed and nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">Saul laughed again. &quot;It isn't
that simple. It takes years of training, and even then it's like an old radio
would you like to hear a scientific lecture while you're being laid? That's a
perversion we've never tried before.&quot; His hand moved down from her cheek to
her neck and then began unbuttoning her blouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">(&quot;Thank you Cassandra,&quot;
Milo A. Flanagan said fervently. &quot;I'm eternally grateful to you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">&quot;One helping hand deserves
another,&quot; Cassandra replied; she remembered how Milo and Smiling Jim
Tre-pomena had helped her get the abortion the time she was knocked up by that
Canvera character. Her father had wanted to send her to New York for a legal D
&amp; C, but Milo had pointed out that it would look kind of funny to some
people for the daughter of a high KCUF spokesman to have an <i>official </i>abortion.
&quot;Besides,&quot; Smiling Jim had added, &quot;you don't want to fool around
with them New</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">York

Actually, though, the real reason Cassandra was blowing the whistle on Padre
Pederastia's bomb emporium was to annoy Simon Moon, whom she had been trying to

<p>&quot;Wildeblood here,&quot; the cultured drawl came over the wire.</p>

another cigarette butt in his ashtray and worrying about lung cancer.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and you'll love it. I really tear these two smart-asses
apart.&quot; Wildeblood was enthusiastic. &quot;Listen to this: 'a pair of
nursery Nietzsches dreaming of a psychedelic Superman.' And this: 'a plot that
is only a put-on, characters who are cardboard, and a pretense of scholarship
that amounts to sheer bluff.' But <i>this </i>is the crusher; listen: 'a
constant use of obscene language for shock effect until the reader begins to
feel as depressed as an unwilling spectator at a quarrel between a fishwife and
a lobster-pot pirate.' Don't you think that will get quoted at all the best
cocktail parties this season?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose so. The book's a real stinker, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heavens, I wouldn't know for sure. I told you yesterday, it's absurdly <i>long.
</i>Three volumes, in fact. Boring as hell. I only had time to skim it. But
listen to this, dear boy: 'If <i>The Lord of the Rings </i>is a fairy tale for
adults, sophisticated readers will quickly recognize this monumental miscarriage
as a fairy tale for paranoids.' That refers to the ridiculous conspiracy theory
that the plot, if there is one, seems to revolve around. Nicely worded, wouldn't
you say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; Peter said, crossing off <i>book review </i>on his
pad. &quot;Send it over. I'll pay the messenger.&quot;</p>
<p>Epicene Wildeblood, hanging up, crossed off <i>Confrontation </i>on his own
pad, found <i>Time </i>next on the list, and picked up another book to be

witticisms. He was feeling more than usually misanthropic, having had a
disastrous evening the night before. Somebody had answered his personal ad about
his &quot;interest in Greek Culture&quot; and he had thrilled at the thought of
a new asshole to conquer; the asshole, unfortunately, had turned out to be the
Vice President of the United States, who was interested only in declaiming about
the glorious achievements of the military junta that had ruled in Athens. When
Eppy, despairing of sex, had tried to steer the conversation to Plato at least,
the VP asked, &quot;Are you sure he was a Greek? That sounds like a wop name to
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">You see, darling, it all revolves
around sex, but not in the sense that Freud thought. Freud never understood sex.
Hardly anybody understands sex, in fact, except a few poets here and there. Any
scientist who starts to get an inkling keeps his mouth shut because he knows
he'd be drummed out of the profession if he said what he knew. Here, I'll help
you unhook that. What we're feeling now is supposed to be tension, and what
we'll feel after orgasm is supposed to be relaxation. Oh, they're so pretty.
Yes, I know I always say that. But they are pretty. Pretty, pretty, pretty.
Mmmm. Mmmm. Oh, yes, yes. Just hold it like that a moment. Yes. Tension? Lord,
yes that's what I mean. How can this be tension? What's it got in common with
worry or anxiety or anything else that we call tension? It's a strain, but not a
tension. It's a drive to break out, and a tension is a drive to hold in. Those
are the two polarities. Oh, stop for a minute. Let me do this. You like that?</span></p>
<p>Oh, darling, yes, darling, I like it, too. It makes me happy to make you
happy. You see, we're trying to break through our skins into each other. We're
trying to break the walls, walls, walls. Yes, Yes. Break the walls. Tension is
trying to hold up the walls, to keep the outside from getting in. It's the
opposite. Oh, Rebecca. Let me kiss them again. They're so pretty. Pretty pretty
titties. Mmm. Mmm. Pretty. And so big and round. Oh, you've got two hard-ons and
I've only got one. And this, this, ah, you like it, don't you, that's three
hard-ons. You want me to take my finger away and kiss it? Oh, darling, pretty
belly, pretty. Mmm. Mmm. Darling, Mmm. MMMMM. Mmm. Lord, Lord. You never came so
fast before, oh, I love you. Are you happy? I'm so happy. That's right, just for
a minute. Oh, God, I love watching you do that. I love to see it go into your
mouth. Lord, God, Rebecca, I love it. Yes, now I'll put him in. Little Saul,
there, coming up inside you, there. Does little Rebecca like him? I know, I
know. They love each other, don't they? The way we love each other. She's so
warm, she welcomes him so nicely. You're inside me, too. That's what I'm trying
to say. My field. You're inside my field, just like I'm inside yours. It's the
fields, not the physical act. That's what people are afraid of. That's why
they're tense during sex. They're afraid of letting the fields merge. It's a
unifying of the forces. God, I can't keep talking. Well, if we slow way down,
yes, this is nicer, isn't it? That's why it's so fast for most people. They
rush, complete the physical act, before the fields are charged. They never
experience the fields. They think it's poetry, fiction, when somebody who's had
it describes it. One scientist knew. He died in prison. I'll tell you about him
later. It's the big taboo, the one all the others grow out of. It isn't sex
itself they're trying to stop. That's too strong, they can't stop it. It's this.
Darling, yes. This. The unifying. It happens at death, but they try to steal it
even then. They've taken it out of sex. That's why the fantasies. And the
promiscuity. The search. Blacks, homosexuality, our parents, people we <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt">know
we hate, Saint Bernards. Everything. It's not neuroses or perversion. It's a
search. A desperate search. Everybody wants sex with an enemy. Hate mobilizes
the field, too, you see. And hate. Is safer. Safer than love. Love too
dangerous. Lord, Lord, I love you. I love you. Let me more. Get the weight on my
elbows, hold your ass with my hands. Yes. Poetry isn't poetry. I mean it doesn't
lie. It's true when I say I worship you. Can't say it outside bed. Can only say
love then, usually. Worship too scary. Some people can't even say love in bed.
Searching, partner to partner. Never able to say love. Never able to feel it.
Under control. They can't let us learn, or the game is up. Their name? They got
a million names. Monopolize it. Keep it to themselves. They had to stamp it out
in the rest of us, to control. To control us. Drove it underground, into
background noise. Mustn't break through. That's how. How it happened. Darling.
First they repressed telepathy, then sex. That's why schizos. Darling. Why
schizos break into crazy sex things first. Why homosexuals dig the occult. Break
one taboo, come close to the next. Finally break the wall entirely. Get through.
Like we get through, together. They can't have that. Got to keep us apart.
Schisms. Always splitting and schisms. White against black, men against women,
all the way down the line. Keep us apart. Don't let us merge. Make sex a dirty
joke. A few more minutes. A few more. My tongue in your ear. Oh, God. Soon. So
