<p>Property is theft</p>
<p>—P. J. PROUDHON</p>
<p>Property is liberty.</p>
<p>—P. J. PROUDHON</p>
<p>Property is impossible.</p>
<p>—P. J. PROUDHON</p>
<p>Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. —RALPH WALDO EMERSON</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proudhon, by piling up his contradictions this way, was not merely being
French; he was trying to indicate that the abstraction &quot;property&quot;
covers a variety of phenomena, some pernicious and some beneficial. Let us
borrow a device from the semanticists and examine his triad with subscripts
attached for maximum clarity.</p>
<p>&quot;Property<sub>1</sub> is theft&quot; means that property<sub>1,</sub>
created by the artificial laws of feudal, capitalist, and other authoritarian
societies, is based on armed robbery. Land titles, for instance, are clear
examples of property<sub>1</sub>; swords and shot were the original coins of
transaction.</p>
<p>&quot;Property<sub>2</sub> is liberty&quot; means that property<sub>2</sub> ,
that which will be voluntarily honored in a voluntary (anarchist) society, is
the foundation of the liberty in that society. The more people's interests are
comingled and confused, as in collectivism, the more they will be stepping on
each other's toes; only when the rules of the game declare clearly &quot;This is
mine and this is thine,&quot; <i>and the game is voluntarily accepted as
worthwhile by all parties to it, </i>can true independence be achieved.</p>
<p>&quot;Property<sub>3</sub> is impossible&quot; means that property<sub>3</sub>
(= property<sub>1</sub>) creates so much conflict of interest that society is in
perpetual undeclared civil war and must eventually devour itself (and properties<sub>1</sub>
and <sub>3 </sub>as well). In short, Proudhon, in his own way, foresaw the Snafu
Principle. He</p>
<p>also foresaw that communism would only perpetuate and aggravate the
conflicts, and that <i>anarchy is the only viable alternative to this chaos.</i></p>
<p>It is not averred, of course, that property<sub>3</sub> will come into
existence only in a totally voluntary society; many forms of it already exist.
The error of most alleged libertarians—especially the followers (!) of the
egregious Ayn Rand—is to assume that all property<sub>1</sub> is property<sub>2</sub>.
The distinction can be made by any IQ above 70 and is absurdly simple. The test
is to ask, of any title of ownership you are asked to accept or which you ask
others to accept, &quot;Would this be honored in a free society of rationalists,
or does it require the armed might of a State to force people to honor it?&quot;
If it be the former, it is property? and represents liberty; if it be the
latter, it is property<sub>1</sub> and represents theft.</p>
