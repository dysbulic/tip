<p>The Purple Sage cursed and waxed sorely pissed and cried out in a loud voice:
A pox upon the accursed Illuminati of Bavaria; may their seed take no root.</p>
<p>May their hands tremble, their eyes dim and their spines curl up, yea,
verily, like unto the backs of snails; and may the vaginal orifices of their
women be clogged with Brillo pads.</p>
<p>For they have sinned against God and Nature; they have made of life a prison;
and they have stolen the green from the grass and the blue from the sky.</p>
<p>And so saying, and grimacing and groaning, the Purple Sage left the world of
men and women and retired to the desert in despair and heavy grumpiness.</p>
<p>But the High Chapperal laughed, and said to the Erisian faithful: Our brother
torments himself with no cause, for even the malign Illuminati are unconscious
pawns of the Divine Plane of Our Lady.</p>
<p>—Mordecai Malignatus, K.N.S.,</p>
<p>&quot;The Book of Contradictions,&quot; <i>Liber 555</i></p>
<p>October 23, 1970, was the thirty-fifth anniversary of the murder of Arthur
Flegenheimer (alias &quot;The Dutchman,&quot; alias &quot;Dutch Schultz&quot;),
but this dreary lot has no intention of commemorating that occasion. They are
the Knights of Christianity United in Faith (the group in Atlantis were called
Mauls of Lhuv-Kerapht United for the Truth; see what I mean?) and their
president, James J. (Smiling Jim) Treponema, has noted a bearded and therefore
suspicious young man among the delegates. Such types were not likely to be KCUF
members and might even be dope fiends. Smiling Jim told the Andy Frain ushers to
keep a watchful eye on the young man so no &quot;funny business&quot; could
occur, and then went to the podium to begin his talk on &quot;Sex Education:
Communist Trojan Horse in Our Schools.&quot; (In Atlantis, it was &quot;Numbers:
Nothingarian Squid-Trap in Our Schools.&quot; The same drivel eternally.) The
bearded young man, who happened to be Simon Moon, adviser to <i>Teenset </i>magazine
on II-luminati affairs and instructor in sexual yoga to numerous black young
ladies, observed that he was being observed (which made him think of Heisenberg)
and settled back in bis chair to doodle pentagons on his note pad. Three rows
ahead, a crew-cut middle-aged man, who looked like a surburban Connecticut
doctor, also settled back comfortably, awaiting his opportunity: the funny
business that he and Simon had in mind would be, he hoped, very funny indeed.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">WE SHALL NOT WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED</span></b></p>
<p>There is a road going due east from Dayton, Ohio, toward New Lebanon and
Brookville, and on a small farm off that road lives an excellent man named James
V. Riley, who is a sergeant on the Dayton police force. Although he grieves the
death of his wife two years back in '67 and worries about his son, who seems to
be in some shady business involving frequent travel between New York City and
Cuernavaca, the sergeant is basically a cheerful man; but on June 25, 1969, he
was a bit out of sorts and generally not up to snuff because of his arthritis
and the seemingly endless series of pointless and peculiar questions being asked
by the reporter from New York. It didn't make sense—who would want to publish
a book about John Dillinger at this late date? And why would such a book deal
with Dillinger's dental history?</p>
<p>&quot;You're the same James Riley who was on the Mooresville, Indiana, Force
when Dillinger was first arrested, in 1924?&quot; the reporter had begun.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and a smart-alecky young punk he was. I don't hold with some of
these people who've written books about him and said the long sentence he got
back then is what made him bitter and turned him bad. He got the long sentence
because he was so snotty to the judge. Not a sign of repentence or remorse, just
wisecracks and a know-it-all grin spread all over his face. A bad apple from the
start. And always hellbent-for-leather. In a hurry to get God knows where.
Sometimes folks used to joke that there were two of him, he'd go through town so
fast.</p>
<p>Rushing to his own funeral. Young punks like that never get long enough
sentences, if you want my opinion. Might slow them down a bit&quot;</p>
<p>The reporter—what was his name again? James Mallison, hadn't he said?—was
impatient. &quot;Yes, yes, I'm sure we need stricter laws and harsher penalties.
But what I want to know was where was Dillinger's missing tooth— on the right
side or the left side of his face?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Saints in Heaven! You expect me to remember that after all these
years?&quot;</p>
<p>The reporter dabbed his forehead with a handkerchief—very nervous he seemed
to be. &quot;Look, Sergeant, some psychologists say we never forget anything,
really; it's all stored somewhere inside our brain. Now, just try to picture
John Dillinger as you remember him, with that know-it-all grin as you called it
Can you get the picture into focus? Which side is the missing tooth on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, I'm due to go on duty in a few minutes and I can't be—&quot;</p>
<p>Mallison's faced changed, as if in desperation which he was trying to
conceal. &quot;Well, let me ask you a different question. Are you a Mason?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Mason? Bejesus, no—I've been a Catholic all my life, I'll have you
know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, did you know any Masons in Mooresville? I mean, to talk to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why would I be talking to the likes of them, with the terrible things
they're always saying about the church?&quot;</p>
<p>The reporter plunged on, &quot;All the books on Dillinger say that the
intended victim of that first robbery, the grocer B. F. Morgan, summoned help by
giving the Masonic signal of distress. Do you know what that is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd have to ask a Mason, and I'm sure they wouldn't be telling. The
way they keep their secrets, by the saints, I'm sure even the FBI couldn't find
out.&quot;</p>
<p>The reporter finally left, but Sergeant Riley, a methodical man, filed his
name in memory: James Mallison—or had he said Joseph Mallison? A strange book
he claimed to be writing—about Dillinger's teeth and the bloody atheistic
Freemasons. There was more to this than met the eye, obviously.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">LIKE A TREE THAT'S PLANTED BY THE WATER WE
SHALL NOT BE MOVED</span></b></p>
<p>Miskatonic University, in Arkham, Massachusetts, is not a well-known campus
by any means, and the few scholarly visitors who come there are an odd lot,
drawn usually by the strange collection of occult books given to the Miskatonic
Library by the late Dr. Henry Armitage. Miss Doris Horus, the librarian, had
never seen quite such a strange visitor though, as this Professor J. D. Mallison
who claimed to come from Dayton, Ohio, but spoke with an unmistakable New York
accent. Considering his fur-tiveness, she found it no surprise that he spent the
whole day (June 26, 1969) pouring over the rare copy of Dr. John Dee's
translation of the <i>Necronomicon </i>of Abdul Alhazred. That was the book most
of the queer ones went for; that or <i>The Book of Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin
the Mage.</i></p>
<p>Doris didn't like the <i>Necronomicon, </i>although she considered herself an
emancipated and free-thinking young woman. There was something sinister, or to
be downright honest about it, <i>perverted </i>about that book—and not in a
nice, exciting way, but in a sick and frightening way. All those strange
illustrations, always with five-sided borders just like the Pentagon in
Washington, but with those people inside doing all those freaky sex acts with
those other creatures who weren't people at all. It was frankly Doris's opinion
that old Abdul Alhazred had been smoking some pretty bad grass when he dreamed
up those things. Or maybe it was something stronger than grass: she remembered
one sentence from the text: &quot;Onlie those who have eaten a certain alkaloid
herb, whose name it were wise not to disclose to the unilluminated, maye in the
fleshe see a Shoggothe.&quot; I wonder what a &quot;Shoggothe&quot; is, Doris
thought idly; probably one of those disgusting creatures that the people in the
illustrations are doing those horny things with. Yech.</p>
<p>She was glad when J. D. Mallison- finally left and she could return the <i>Necronomicon
</i>to its position on the closed shelves. She remembered the brief biography of
crazy old Abdul Alhazred that Dr. Armitage had written and also given to the
library: &quot;Spent seven years in the desert and claimed to have visited Irem,
the city forbidden in the <i>Koran, </i>which Alhazred asserted was of pre-human
origin. . . .&quot; Silly! Who was around to build cities before there were
people? Those Shoggothes? &quot;An indifferent</p>
<p>Moslem, he worshipped beings whom he called Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu.&quot;
And that insidious line: &quot;According to contemporary historians, Alhazred's
death was both tragic and bizarre, since it was asserted that he was eaten alive
by an invisible monster in the middle of the market-place.&quot; Dr. Armitage
had been such a nice old man, Doris remembered, even if his talk about
cabalistic numbers and Masonic symbols was a little peculiar at times; why would
he collect such <i>icky </i>books by <i>creepy </i>people?</p>
<p><i>The Internal Revenue Service knows this much about Robert Putney Drake:
during the last fiscal year, he earned $23,000,005 on stocks and bonds in
various defense corporations, $17,000,523 from the three banks he controlled,
and $5,807,400 from various real-estate holdings. They did not know that he also
banked (in Switzerland) over $100,000,000 from prostitution, an equal amount
from heroin and gambling, and $2,500,000 from pornography. On the other hand,
they didn't know either about certain legitimate business expenses which he had
not cared to claim, including more than $5,000,000 in bribes to various
legislators, judges and police officials, in all 50 states in order to maintain
the laws which made men's vices so profitable to him, and $50,000 to Knights of
Christianity United in Faith as a last-ditch effort to stave off total
legalization of pornography and the collapse of that part of his empire.</i></p>
<p>&quot;What the deuce do you make of this?&quot; Barney Muldoon asked. He was
holding an amulet in his hand. &quot;Found it in the bedroom,&quot; he
explained, holding it for Saul to examine the strange design:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape
 id="_x0000_i1026" type="#_x0000_t75" alt="illum-part2-1.jpg" style='width:100.5pt;

</v:shape><![endif]-->
<img src="1.htm2.jpg" alt="illum-part2-1.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026" width="134" height="107"></p>
<p>&quot;Part of it is Chinese,&quot; Saul said thoughtfully. &quot;The basic
design—two interlocking commas, one pointing up and the other down. It means
that opposites are equal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what does <i>that </i>mean?&quot; Muldoon asked sarcastically.
&quot;Opposites are opposite, not equal. You'd have to be a Chinaman to think
otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>Saul ignored the comment. &quot;But the pentagon isn't in the Chinese
design—and neither is the apple with the <i>K </i>in it. . . .&quot; Suddenly,
he grinned. &quot;Wait, I'll bet I know what that is. It's from Greek mythology.
There was a banquet on Olympus, and Eris wasn't invited, because she was the
Goddess of Discord and always made trouble. So, to get even, she made <i>more </i>trouble:
she created a beautiful golden apple and wrote on it <i>Kattisti. </i>That means
'for the prettiest one' in Greek. It's what the <i>K </i>stands for, obviously.
Then she rolled it into the banquet hall, and, naturally, all the goddesses
there immediately claimed it, each one saying that <i>she </i>was 'the prettiest
one.' Finally, old man Zeus himself, to settle the squabble, allowed Paris to
decide which goddess was the prettiest and should get the apple. He chose
Aphrodite, and as a reward she gave him an opportunity to kidnap Helen, which
led to the Trojan War.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very interesting,&quot; Muldoon said. &quot;And does that tell us what
Joseph Malik knew about the assassinations of the Kennedys and this Illuminati
bunch and why his office was blown up? Or where he's disappeared to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, no,&quot; Saul said, &quot;but it's nice to find something in
this case that I can recognize. I just wish I knew what the pentagon means, too.
. . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's look at the rest of the memos,&quot; Muldoon suggested.</p>
<p>The next memo, however, stopped them cold:</p>
<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO <i>#9</i></p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p>The following chart appeared in the <i>East Village Other, </i>June 11, 1969,
with the label &quot;Current Structure of the Bavarian Illuminati Conspiracy and
the Law of Fives&quot;:</p>

<p>The chart hangs at the top of the page, the rest of which is empty space—as
if the editors originally intended to publish an article explaining it, but
decided (or were persuaded) to suppress all but the diagram itself.</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>&quot;This one has to be some damned hippie or yippie hoax,&quot; Muldoon
said after a long pause. But he sounded uncertain.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Part </i>of it is,&quot; Saul said thoughtfully keeping certain
thoughts to himself. &quot;Typical hippie psychology: mixing truth and fantasy
to blow the fuses of the Establishment. The Elders of Zion section is just a
parody of Nazi ideology. If there really was a Jewish conspiracy to run the
world, my rabbi would have let me in on it by now. I contribute enough to the <i>schule.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;My brother's a Jesuit,&quot; Muldoon added, pointing at the Society of
Jesus square, &quot;and he never invited me into any worldwide conspiracy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But this part is almost plausible,&quot; Saul said, pointing to the
Sphere of Aftermath. &quot;Aga Khan <i>is </i>the head of the Ishmaelian sect of
Islam, and that sect was founded by Hassan i Sabbah, the 'old man of the
mountains' who led the Hashishim in the eleventh century. Adam Weishaupt is
supposed to have originated the Bavarian Illuminati after studying Sabbah,
according to the third memo, so this part fits together—and Hassan i Sabbah is
supposed to be the first one to introduce marijuana and hashish to the Western
world, from India. That ties in with Weishaupt's growing hemp and Washington's
having a big hemp crop at Mount Vernon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait a minute. Look at how the whole design revolves around the
pentagon. Everything else sort of grows out of it&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So? You think the Defense Department is the international hub of the
Illuminati conspiracy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's just read the rest of the memos,&quot; Muldoon suggested.</p>
<p>(The Indian Agent at the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin knows this: from
the time Billie Freschette returned there until her death in 1968, she received
mysterious monthly checks from Switzerland. He thinks he knows the explanation;
despite all stories to the contrary, Billie <i>did </i>help to betray Dillinger
and this is the payoff. He is convinced of this. He is also quite wrong.)</p>
<p>&quot;. . . children seven and eight years old,&quot; Smiling Jim Trepomena
is telling the KCUF audience, &quot;are talking about penises and vaginas—<i>and
using those very words! </i>Now, is this an accident? Let me quote you Lenin's
own words....&quot; Simon yawns.</p>
<p>Banana-Nose Maldonado evidently had his own brand of sentimentality or
superstition, and in 1936 he ordered his son, a priest, to say one hundred
masses for the salvation of the Dutchman's soul. Even years afterward, he would
defend the Dutchman in conversation: &quot;He was OK, Dutch was, if you didn't
cross him. If you did, forget it; you were finished. He was almost a Siciliano
about that. Otherwise, he was a good businessman, and the first one with a real
CPA mind in the whole organization. If he hadn't gotten that crazy-head idea
about gunning down Tom Dewey, he'd still be a big man. I told him myself. 'You
kill Dewey,' I said, 'and the shit hits the fan everywhere. The boys won't take
the risk; Lucky and the Butcher want to cowboy you right now.' But he wouldn't
listen. 'Nobody fucks with me,' he said. 'I don't care if his name is Dewey,
Looey, or Phooey. He <i>dies' </i>A real stubborn German Jew. You couldn't talk
to him. I even told him how Capone helped set up Dillinger for the Feds just
because of the heat those bank-heists were bringing down.</p>
<p>You know what he said? He said: 'You tell Al that Dillinger was a lone wolf.
I have my own pack.' Too bad, too bad, too bad. I'll light another candle for
him at church Sunday.&quot;</p>

<p>Rebecca Goodman closes her book wearily and stares into space, thinking about
Babylon. Her eyes focus suddenly on the statue Saul had bought her for her last
birthday: the mermaid of Copenhagen. How many Danes, she wonders, know that this
is one form of representation of the Babylonian sex goddess Ishtar? <i>(In
Central Park, Perri the squirrel is beginning to hunt for the day's food. A
French poodle, held on a leash by a mink-coated lady, barks at him, and he runs
three times around a tree.) </i>George Dorn looks at the face of a corpse: it is
his own face. &quot;In Wyoming, after one sex-education class in a high school,
the teacher was raped by seventeen boys. She said later she would never teach
sex in school again.&quot; Making sure he is alone in the Meditation Room of the
UN building, the man calling himself Frank Sullivan quickly moves the black
plinth aside and descends the hidden stairs into the tunnel. He is thinking,
whimsically, that hardly anybody realizes that the shape of the room is the same
as the truncated pyramid on the dollar bill, or guesses what that means.
&quot;In Wilmette, Illinois, an 8-year-old boy came home from a sensitivity
training class and tried to have intercourse with his 4-year-old sister.&quot;
Simon gave up on his pentagons and began doodling pyramids instead.</p>
<p>Above, beyond Joe Malik's window, Saul Goodman gave up on the line of thought
which had led him to surmise that the Illuminati were a front for the
International Psychoanalytical Society, conspiring to drive everyone paranoid,
and turned back to the desk and the memos. Barney Muldoon came in from the
bedroom, carrying a strange amulet, and asked, &quot;What do you make of
this?&quot; Saul looked at a design of an apple and a pentagon . . . and,
several years earlier, Simon Moon looked at the same medallion.</p>
<p>&quot;They call it the Sacred Chao,&quot; Padre Pederastia said. They sat
alone at a table pulled off to the corner; the Friendly Stranger was the same as
ever, except that a new group, the American Medical Association (consisting,
naturally, of four kids from Germany), had replaced H. P. Lovecraft in the back
room. (Nobody knew that the AMA was going to become the world's most popular
rock group within a year, but Simon already thought they were superheavy). Padre
Pederastia was, as on the night Simon met Miss Mao, very serious and hardly
camping at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Sacred Cow?&quot; Simon asked.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pronounced that way, but you spell it c-h-a-o. A chao is a single
unit of chaos, they figure.&quot; The Padre smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Too much, they're nuttier than the SSS,&quot; Simon objected.</p>
<p>&quot;Never underestimate absurdity, it is one door to the Imagination. Do I
have to remind <i>you </i>of that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have an alliance with them?&quot; Simon asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The JAMs can't do it alone. Yes, we have an alliance, as long as it
profits both parties. John—Mr. Sullivan himself authorized this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK. What do they call themselves?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The LDD.&quot; The Padre permitted himself a smile. &quot;New members
are told the initials stand for Legion of Dynamic Discord. Later on, quite
often, the leader, a most fetching scoundrel and madman named Celine, sometimes
tells them it really stands for Little Deluded Dupes. That's the <i>pans
asinorum, </i>or an early <i>pans asinorum, </i>in Celine's System. He judges
them by how they react to that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Celine's System?&quot; Simon asked warily.</p>
<p>&quot;It leads to the same destination as ours—more or less—by a somewhat
wilder and woolier path.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right-hand or left-hand path?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right-hand,&quot; the priest said. &quot;All absurdist systems are
right-hand. Well, almost all. They don't invoke You-Know-Who under any
circumstances. They rely on Dis-cordia... do you remember your Roman myths?</p>
<p>&quot;Enough to know that Discordia is just the Latin equivalent of Eris.
They're part of the Erisian Liberation Front, then?&quot; Simon was beginning to
wish he were stoned; these conspiratorial conversations always made more sense
when he was slightly high. He wondered how people like the President of the U.S.
or the Chairman of the Board of GM were able to plot such intricate games
without being on a trip at the time. Or did they take enough tranquilizers to
produce a similar effect?</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; the priest said flatly. &quot;Don't ever make that mistake.
ELF is a much more, um, esoteric outfit than the LDD. Celine is on the activist
side, like us. Some of his capers make Morituri or God's Lightning look like
Trap-pists by comparison. No, ELF will never get on Mr. Celine's trip.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's got an absurdist yoga and an activist ethic?&quot; Simon
reflected. &quot;The two don't mix.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Celine is a walking contradiction. Look at his symbol again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've <i>been </i>looking at it and that pentagon worries me. Are you
sure he's on our side?&quot;</p>
<p>The American Medical Association came to some kind of erotic or musical
climax and the priest's answer was drowned out. &quot;What?&quot; Simon asked,
after the applause died down.</p>
<p>&quot;I said,&quot; Padre Pederastia whispered, &quot;that we're never sure <i>anybody
</i>is on our side. Uncertainty is the name of the game.&quot;</p>

<p>On the origin of the pyramid-and-eye symbol, test your credulity on the
following yarn from <i>Flying Saucers in the • Bible </i>by Virginia
Brasington (Saucerian Books, 1963, page 43.):</p>
<p>The Continental Congress had asked Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and
John Adams to arrange for a seal for the United States of America. . . . None of
the designs they created or which were submitted to them, were suitable. . . .</p>
<p>Fairly late at night, after working on the project all day, Jefferson walked
out into the cool night air of the garden to clear his mind. In a few minutes he
rushed back into the room, crying, jubilantly: &quot;I have it! I have it!&quot;
Indeed, he did have some plans in his hands. They were the plans showing the
Great Seal as we know it today.</p>
<p>Asked how he got the plans, Jefferson told a strange story. A man approached
him wearing a black cloak that practically covered him, face and all, and told
him that he (the stranger) knew they were trying to devise a Seal, and that he
had a design which was appropriate and meaningful. . . .</p>
<p>After the excitement died down, the three went into the garden to find the
stranger, but he was gone. <i>Thus, neither these Founding Fathers, nor anybody
else, ever knew who really designed the Great Seal of the United States!</i></p>

<p>The latest I've found on the eye-and-pyramid is in a San Francisco
underground paper <i>(Planet, </i>San Francisco, July 1969, Vol. I, No.4.),
suggesting it as a symbol for Timothy Leary's political party when he was
running for governor of California instead of just running:</p>
<p>The emblem is a tentative design for the Party's campaign button. One wag
suggests that everyone cut out the circle from the back of a dollar bill and
send the wholly dollar to Governor Leary so he can wallpaper his office with
them. Then paste the emblem on your front door to signify your membership in the
party.</p>
<p><i>Translations: </i>The year of the beginning New Secular Order</p>
<p>Both translations are wrong, of course. <i>Annuit Coeptis </i>means &quot;he
blesses our beginning&quot; and <i>Novus Ordo Se~ clorem </i>means &quot;a new
order of the ages.&quot; Oh, well, scholarship was never the hippies' strong
point. But — <i>Tim Leary </i>an Illuminatus?</p>

<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #12</p>
<p>8/3</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p>I've finally found the basic book on the Illuminati: <i>Proofs of a
Conspiracy </i>by John Robison (Christian Book Club of</p>
<p>America, Hawthorn, California, 1961; originally published in 1801). Robison
was an English Mason who discovered through personal experience that the French
Masonic lodges—such as the Grand Orient—were Illuminati fronts and were the
main instigators of the French Revolution, His whole book is very explicit about
how Weishaupt worked: every infiltrated Masonic group would have several levels,
like an ordinary Masonic lodge, but as candidates advanced through the various
degrees they would be told more about the real purposes of the movement. Those
at the bottom simply thought they were Masons; in the middle levels, they knew
they were engaged in a great project to change the world, but the exact nature
of the change was explained to them according to what the leaders thought they
were prepared to know. Only those at the top knew the secret, which—according
to Robison—is this: the Illuminati aims to overthrow all government and
religion, setting up an anarcho-communist free-love world, and, because
&quot;the end justifies the means&quot; (a principle Weishaupt acquired from his
Jesuit youth), they didn't care how many people they killed to accomplish that
noble purpose. Robison knows nothing of earlier Illuminati movements, but does
say specifically that the Bavarian Illuminati was not destroyed by the
government's crackdown in 1785 but was, in fact, still active, both in England
and France and possibly elsewhere, when he wrote, in 1801. On page 116, Robison
lists their existing lodges as follows: Germany (84 lodges); England (8 lodges);
Scotland (2); Warsaw (2); Switzerland (many); Rome, Naples, Ancona, Florence,
France, Holland, Dresden (4); United States of America (several). On page 101,
he mentions that there are 13 ranks in the Order; this may account for the 13
steps on their symbolic pyramid. Page 84 gives the code name of Weishaupt, which
was Sparta-cus; his second-in-command, Freiherr Knigge, had the code name Philo
(page 117); this is revealed in papers seized by the Bavarian government in a
raid on the home of a lawyer named Zwack, who had the code name Cato. Babeuf,
the French revolutionary, evidently took the name Gracchus in imitation of the
classical style of these titles. Robison's conclusion, page 269, <i>is </i>worth
quoting:</p>
<p>Nothing is as dangerous as a mystic Association. The object remaining a
secret in the hands of the managers, the rest simply put a ring in their own
noses, by which they may be led about at pleasure; and still panting after the
secret they are the more pleased the less they see.</p>

<p>The survival of the Bavarian Illuminati throughout the nineteenth century and
into the twentieth is the subject of <i>World Revolution </i>by Nesta Webster
(Constable and Company, London, 1921). Mrs. Webster follows Robison fairly
closely on the early days of the movement, up to the French Revolution, but then
veers off and says that the Illuminati never intended to create their Utopian
anarcho-communist society: that was just another of their masks. Their real
purpose was dictatorship over the world, and so they soon formed a secret
alliance with the Prussian government. All subsequent socialist, anarchist, and
communist movements are mere decoys, she argues, behind which the German General
Staff and the Illuminati are plotting to overthrow other governments, so Germany
can conquer them. (She wrote right after England fought Germany in the First
World War). I see no way of reconciling this with the Birchers&quot;&quot;
thesis that the Illuminati has become a front for the Rhodes Scholars to take
over the world for <i>English </i>domination. Obviously—as Robison
states—the Illuminati say different things to different people, to get them
into the conspiracy. As for the links with modern communism, here are some
passages from her pages 234-45:</p>
<p>But now that the (First) Internationale was dead it became necessary for the
secret societies to reorganize, and it is at this crisis that we find that
&quot;formidable sect&quot; springing to life again—<i>the original llluminati
of Weishaupt. . . . </i>What we do know definitely is that the society was
refounded in Dresden in 1880. . . . That it was consciously modelled on its
eighteenth century predecessor is clear from the fact that its chief, one
Leopold Engel, was the author of a lengthy panegyric on Weishaupt and his Order,
entitled <i>Geschichte des Illuminaten Ordens </i>(published in 1906). . . .</p>
<p>... In London a lodge called by the same name . . . carried on the rite of
Memphis—founded, it is said, by Cagliostro on Egyptian models—and initiated
adepts into illuminized Freemasonry. . . .</p>
<p>Was it ... a mere coincidence that in July 1889 an International Socialist
Congress decided that May 1, which was the day on which Weishaupt founded the
Illuminati, should be chosen for an annual International Labour demonstration?</p>

<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #14</p>
<p>8/6</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>J.M.:</p>
<p>And here's still another version of the origin of the Illuminati, from the
Cabalist Eliphas Levi <i>(The History of Magic </i>by Eliphas Levi, Borden
Publishing Company, Los Angeles, 1963, page 65). He says there were two
Zoroasters, a true one who taught white &quot;right hand&quot; magic and a false
one who taught black &quot;left hand&quot; magic. He goes on:</p>
<p>To the false Zoroaster must be referred the cultus of material fire and that
impious doctrine of divine dualism which produced at a later period the
monstrous Gnosis of Manes and the false principles of spurious Masonry. The
Zoroaster in question was the father of that materialized Magic which led to the
massacre of the Magi and brought their true doctrine at first into proscription
and then oblivion. Ever inspired by the spirit of truth, the Church was forced
to condemn— under the names of Magic, Manicheanism, Illumi-nism and
Masonry—all that was in kinship, remote or approximate, with the primitive
profanation of the mysteries. One signal example is the history of the Knights
Templar, which has been misunderstood to this day.</p>
<p>Lev! does not elucidate that last sentence; it is interesting, however, that
Nesta Webster (see memo 13) also traced the Illuminati to the Knights Templar,
whereas Daraul and most other sources track them Eastward to the Hashishim. Is
all this making me paranoid? I'm beginning to get the impression that the
evidence has not only been hidden in obscure books but also made confusing and
contradictory to discourage the researcher. . . .</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>Scrawled on the bottom of this memo was a series of jottings in the same
masculine hand (Malik's, Saul guessed) that had jotted the baboon reference on
memo 12. The jottings said:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Christ,&quot; Barney groaned. &quot;Oh, Mary and Joseph. Oh, shit.
We'll end up either become mystics or going crazy before this case is over. If
there's any difference.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Order of DeMolay is a Masonic society for boys,&quot; Saul
commented helpfully. &quot;I don't know what the Atus of Tahuti are, but that
sounds Egyptian. Taro, usually spelled t-a-r-o-t, is the deck of cards Gypsy
fortune tellers use—and the word 'Gypsy' means Egyptian. Tora is the Law, in
Hebrew. We keep coming back to something that has roots in both Jewish mysticism
and Egyptian magic. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Knights Templar were kicked out of the church,&quot; Barney said,
&quot;for trying to combine Christian and Moslem ideas. Last year, my
brother—the Jesuit—gave a lecture about how modern ideas are just old
heresies from the Middle Ages warmed over. I had to go for politeness* sake. I
remember something else he said about the Templars. They were engaged in what he
called 'unnatural sex acts.' In other words, they were faggots. Do you get the
impression that all these groups related to the Illuminati are all male? Maybe
the big secret they're hiding so fanatically <i>is </i>that they're all some
vast worldwide homosexual plot. I've heard show-biz people complain about what
they call the 'homintern,' <i>a </i>homo organization that tries to keep all the
best jobs for other fruits. How does that sound?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds plausible,&quot; Saul said ironically. &quot;But it also
sounds plausible to say the Illuminati is a Jewish conspiracy, a Catholic
conspiracy, a Masonic conspiracy, a communist conspiracy, a banker's conspiracy,
and I suppose we'll eventually find evidence to suggest it's an interplanetary
scheme masterminded from Mars or Venus. Don't you see, Barney? Whatever they're
really up to, they keep creating masks so all sorts of scapegoat groups will get
the blame for being the 'real' Illuminati.&quot; He shook his head dismally.
&quot;They're smart enough to know they can't operate indefinitely without a few
people eventually realizing something's there, so they've taken that into
account and arranged for an inquisitive outsider to get all sorts of wrong ideas
about who they are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're dogs,&quot; Muldoon said. &quot;Intelligent talking dogs from
the dog star, Sirius. They came here and ate Malik. Just like they ate that guy
in Kansas City, except that time they didn't get to finish the job.&quot; He
turned back and read from memo 8: &quot;'. . . with his throat torn as if by the
talons of some enormous beast. No animal was reported missing from any of the
local zoos.'&quot; He grinned. &quot;Lord God, I'm almost ready to believe
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're werewolves.&quot; Saul answered, grinning also. &quot;The
pentagon is the symbol of the werewolf. Look at the Late Late Show some
tune.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's the pentagram, not the pentagon.&quot; Barney lit a cigarette,
adding. &quot;This is really getting on our nerves, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>Saul looked up wearily and glanced around the apartment almost as if he were
looking for its absent owner. &quot;Joseph Malik,&quot; he said aloud,
&quot;what can of worms have you opened? And how far back does it go?&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">WE SHALL NOT</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED</span></b></p>
<p>In fact, for Joseph Malik the beginning was several years earlier, in a
medley of teargas, hymn singing, billy clubs, and obscenity, all of which were
provoked by the imminent nomination for President of a man named Hubert Horatio
Humphrey. It began in Lincoln Park on the night of August 25, 1968, while Joe
was waiting to be teargassed. He did not know then that anything was beginning;
he was only conscious, in an acid, gut-sour way, of what was ending: his own
faith in the Democratic party.</p>
<p>He was sitting with the Concerned Clergymen under the cross they had erected.
He was thinking, bitterly, that they should have erected a tombstone instead. It
should have said: Here lies the New Deal.</p>
<p>Here lies the belief that all Evil is on the <i>other </i>side, among the
reactionaries and Ku Kluxers. Here lies twenty years of the hopes and dreams and
sweat and blood of Joseph Wendall Malik. Here lies American Liberalism, clubbed
to death by Chicago's heroic peace officers.</p>
<p>&quot;They're coming,&quot; a voice near him said suddenly. The Concerned
Clergymen immediately began singing, &quot;We shall not be moved.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll be moved, all right,&quot; a dry sardonic, W.C. Fields voice said
quietly. &quot;When the teargas hits, we'll be moved.&quot; Joe recognized the
speaker: it was novelist William Burroughs with his usual poker face, utterly
without anger or contempt or indignation or hope or faith or any emotion Joe
could understand. But he sat there, making his own protest against Hubert
Horatio Humphrey by placing his body in front of Chicago's police, for reasons
Joe could not understand.</p>
<p>How, Joe wondered, can a man have courage without faith, without belief?
Burroughs believed in nothing, and yet there he sat stubborn as Luther. Joe had
always had faith in something—Roman Catholicism, long ago, then Trotskyism at
college, then for nearly two decades mainstream liberalism (Arthur Schlesinger,
Jr.'s, &quot;Vital Center&quot;) and now, with that dead, he was trying
desperately to summon up faith in the motley crowd of dope-and-as-trology-obsessed
Yippies, Black Maoists, old-line hardcore pacifists, and arrogantly dogmatic SDS
kids who had come to Chicago to protest a rigged convention and were being
beaten and brutalized unspeakably for it.</p>
<p>Alien Ginsberg—sitting amid a huddle of Yippies off to the right—began
chanting again, as he had all evening: &quot;Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna
Krishna Hare Hare. . . .&quot; Ginsberg believed; he believed in everything—in
democracy, in socialism, in communism, in anarchism, in Ezra Pound's idealistic
variety of fascist economics, in Buckminster Fuller's technological Utopia, in
D. H. Lawrence's return to preindustrial pastoralism, and in Hinduism, Buddhism,
Judaism, Christianity, Voodoo, astrology magic; but, above all, in the natural
goodness of man.</p>
<p>The natural goodness of man . . . Joe hadn't fully believed in that, since
Buchenwald was revealed to the world in 1944, when he was seventeen.</p>
<p>&quot;KILL! KILL! KILL!&quot; came the chant of the police,—exactly like
the night before, the same neolithic scream of rage that signaled the beginning
of the first massacre. They were coming, clubs in hand, spraying the teargas
before them. &quot;KILL! KILL! KILL!&quot;</p>
<p>Auschwitz, U.S.A., Joe thought, sickened. If they had been issued Zyklon B
along with the teargas and Mace, they would be using it just as happily.</p>
<p>Slowly, the Concerned Clergymen came to their feet, holding dampened
handkerchiefs to their faces. Unarmed and helpless, they prepared to hold their
ground as long as possible before the inevitable retreat. A moral victory, Joe
thought bitterly: All we ever achieve are moral victories. The immoral brutes
win the real victories.</p>
<p>&quot;All hail Discordia,&quot; said a voice among the clergymen—a bearded
young man named Simon, who had been arguing in favor of anarchism against some
SDS Maoists earlier in the day.</p>
<p>And that was the last sentence Joe Malik remembered clearly, for it was gas
and clubs and screams and blood from then on. He had no way of guessing, at the
time, that hearing that sentence was the most important thing that happened to
him in Lincoln Park.</p>
<p>(Harry Coin curls his long body into a knot of tension, resting on his elbows
and sighting the Remington rifle carefully, as the motorcade passes the Book
Depository and heads toward his perch on the triple underpass. He could see
Bernard Barker from the CIA down on the grassy knoll. If he carried this off
right, they promised him more jobs; it would be the end of petty crime for him,
the beginning of big-time money. In a way he was sorry: Kennedy seemed like a
nice enough young fellow—Harry would like to make it with both him and that
hot-looking wife of his at the same tune—but money talks and sentiment is only
for fools. He released the bolt action, ignoring the sudden barking of a dog,
and took aim—just as the three shots resounded from the grassy knoll.</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus Motherfuckin' Christ,&quot; he said; and then he caught the glint
of the rifle in the Book Depository window. Great God Almighty, how the <i>fuck </i>many
of us are there here?&quot; he cried out, scampering to his feet and starting to
run.)</p>
<p>It was almost a year after being clubbed—June 22, 1969—that Joe returned
to Chicago, to witness another rigged convention, to suffer further
disillusionment, to meet Simon once more and to hear the mysterious phrase
&quot;All hail Discordia&quot; again.</p>
<p>The convention this time was the last ever held by the Students for a
Democratic Society, and from the first hour after it opened, Joe realized that
the Progressive Labor faction had stacked all the cards in advance. It was the
Democratic party all over again—and it would have been equally bloody if the
PL boys had their own police force to &quot;deal with&quot; the dissenters known
then as RYM-I and RYM-II. Lacking that factor, the smoldering violence remained
purely verbal, but when it was all over another part of Joe Malik was dead and
his faith in the natural goodness of man was eroded still further. And so he
found himself, aimlessly searching for something that was not totally corrupt,
attending the Anarchist Caucus at the old Wobbly Hall on North Halsted Street.</p>
<p>Joe knew nothing about anarchism, except that several famous
anarchists—Parsons and Spies of Chicago's Hay-market riot in 1888, Sacco and
Vanzetti in Massachusetts, and the Wobbly's own poet-laureate, Joe Hill—had
been executed for murders which they apparently hadn't really committed. Beyond
that, anarchists wanted to abolish government—a proposition so evidently
absurd that Joe had never bothered to read any of their theoretical or polemical
works. Now, however, eating the maggotty meat of his growing disillusionment
with every conventional approach to politics, he began to listen to the Wobblies
and other anarchists with acute curiousity. After all, the words of his favorite
fictional hero, &quot;When you have eliminated all other possibilities, whatever
remains, however improbable, must be true.&quot;</p>
<p>The anarchists, Joe found, were not going to quit SDS—&quot;We'll stay in
and do some righteous ass-kicking,&quot; one of them said, to the applause and
cheers of the others.</p>
<p>Beyond that, however, they seemed to be in a welter of ideological
disagreement. Gradually, he began to identify the conflicting positions
expressed: the individualist-anarchists, who sounded like right-wing Republicans
(except that they wanted to get rid of all functions of government); the
anarcho-syndicalists and Wobblies, who sounded like Marxists (except that they
wanted to get rid of all functions of government); the anarcho-pacifists, who
sounded like Gandhi and Martin Luther King (except that they wanted to get rid
of all functions of government); and a group who were dubbed, rather
affectionately, &quot;the Crazies&quot;—whose position was utterly
unintelligible. Simon was among the Crazies.</p>
<p>In a speech that Joe followed only with difficulty, Simon declared that
&quot;cultural revolution&quot; was more important than political revolution;
that Bugs Bunny should be adopted as the symbol of anarchists everywhere; that
Hoffman's discovery of LSD in 1943 was a manifestation of direct intervention by
God in human affairs; that the nomination of the boar hog Pigasus for President
of the United States by the Yippies had been the most &quot;transcendentally
lucid&quot; political act of the twentieth century; and that &quot;mass orgies
of pot-smoking and fucking, on every street-corner&quot; was the most practical
next step in liberating the world from tyranny. He also urged deep study of the
tarot, &quot;to fight the real enemy with their own weapons,&quot; whatever that
meant. He was launching into a peroration about the mystic significance of the
number 23— pointing out that 2 plus 3 equals 5, the pentad within which the
Devil can be invoked &quot;as for example in a pentacle or at the Pentagon
building in Washington,&quot; while 2 divided by 3 equals 0.666, &quot;the
Number of The Beast, according to that freaked-out Revelation of Saint John the
Mushroom-head,&quot; that 23 itself was present esoterically &quot;because of
its conspicuous exoteric absence&quot; in the number series represented by the
Wobbly Hall address, which was 2422 North Halsted—and that the dates of the
assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, November 22 and 24,
also had a conspicuous 23 absent in between them—when he finally was shouted
down, the conversation returned to a more mundane level.</p>
<p>Half in whimsy and half in despair, Joe decided to perform one of his chronic
acts of faith and convince himself, at least for a while, that there was some
kind of</p>
<p>meaning in Simon's ramblings. His equally chronic skepticism, he knew, would
soon enough reassert itself.</p>
<p>&quot;What the world calls sanity has led us to the present planetary
crises,&quot; Simon had said, &quot;and insanity is the only viable
alternative.&quot; That was a paradox worth some kind of consideration.</p>
<p>&quot;About that 23,&quot; Joe said, approaching Simon tentatively after the
meeting broke up.</p>
<p>&quot;It's everywhere,&quot; was the instant reply. &quot;I just started to
scratch the surface. All the great anarchists died on the 23rd day of some month
or other—Sacco and Vanzetti on August 23, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow on
May 23, Dutch on October 23—and Vince Coll was 23 years old when he was shot <i>on
23rd Street—</i>and even though John Dillinger died on the 22nd of July, if
you look it up, like I did, in Toland's book, <i>The Dillinger Days, </i>you'll
find he couldn't get away from the 23 Principle, because 23 other people died
that night in Chicago, too, all from heat prostration. 'Nova heat moving in,'
dig? And the world began on October 23, in 4004 B.C., according to Bishop Usher,
and the Hungarian Revolution started on October 23, too, and Harpo Marx was born
on November 23, and—&quot;</p>
<p>There was more of it, much more, and Joe patiently listened to all of it,
determined to continue his experiment in applied schizophrenia at least for this
one evening. They retired to a nearby restaurant, the Seminary, on Fullerton
Street, and Simon rambled on, over beers, proceeding to the mystic significance
of the letter <i>W—</i>23rd in the alphabet—and its presence in the words
&quot;woman&quot; and &quot;womb&quot; as well as in the shape of the feminine
breasts and spread-eagled legs of the copulating female. He even found some
mystic meaning in the <i>W </i>in Washington, but was strangely evasive about
explicating this.</p>
<p>&quot;So, you see,&quot; Simon was explaining when the restaurant was
starting to close, &quot;the whole key to liberation is magic. Anarchism remains
tied to politics, and remains a form of death like all other politics, until it
breaks free from the defined <i>'reality' </i>of capitalist society and creates
its own reality. A pig for President. Acid in the water supply. Fucking in the
streets. Making the totally impossible become the eternally possible. Reality is
thermoplastic, not thermosetting, you know: I mean you can reprogram it much
more than people realize. The hex hoax—original sin, logical positivism, those
restriction and constriction myths—all that's based on a thermosetting
reality. Christ, man, there are limits, of course—nobody is nutty enough to
deny <i>that—</i>but the limits are nowhere near as rigid as we've been taught
to believe. It's much closer to the truth to say there are no practical limits
at all and reality is whatever people decide to make it. But we've been on one
restriction kick after another for a couple thousand years now, the world's
longest head-trip, and it takes real negative entropy to shake up the
foundations. This isn't shit; I've got a degree in mathematics, man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I studied engineering myself, a long time ago.&quot; Joe said. &quot;I
realize that part of what you say is true. . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all true. The land belongs to the landlords, right now, because of
magic. People worship the deeds in the government offices, and they won't dare
move onto a square of ground if one of the deeds says somebody else owns it.
It's a head-trip, a kind of magic, and you need the opposite magic to lift the
curse. You need shock elements to break up and disorganize the chains of command
in the brain, the 'mind-forg'd manacles' that Blake wrote about. That's the
unpredictable elements, dads: the erratic, the erotic, the Eristic. Tim Leary
said it: 'People have to go out of their minds before they can come to their
senses.' They can't feel and touch and smell the real earth, man, as long as the
manacles in the cortex tell them it belongs to somebody else. If you don't want
to call it magic, call it counter-conditioning, but the principle is the same.
Breaking up the trip society laid on us and starting our own trip. Bringing back
old realities that are supposed to be dead. Creating new realities. Astrology,
demons, lifting poetry off of the written page into the acts of your daily life.
Surrealism, dig? Antonin Artaud and Andre Breton put it in a nutshell in the
First Surrealist Manifesto: <i>'total transformation of mind, and all that
resembles it.' </i>They knew all about the Illuminated Lodge, founded in Munich
in 1923, and that it controlled Wall Street <i>and </i>Hitler <i>and </i>Stalin,
through witchcraft. We gotta get into witchcraft ourselves to undo the hex
they've cast on everybody's mind. All hail Discordia! Do you read me?&quot;</p>
<p>When they finally parted, and Joe headed back for his hotel, the spell ended.
I've been listening to a spaced-out acid-head all night, Joe thought in his cab
headed south toward the Loop, and almost managing to believe him. If I keep on
with this little experiment, I <i>will </i>believe him. And that's how insanity
always begins: you find reality unbearable and start manufacturing a fantasy
alternative. With an effort of will, he forced himself back into his usual
framework; no matter how cruel reality was, Joe Malik would face it and would
not follow the Yippies and Crazies in the joy ride to Cloud Cuckoo Land.</p>
<p>But when he arrived at his hotel door, and noticed for the first time that he
had Room 23, he had to fight the impulse to call Simon on the phone and tell him
about the latest invasion of surrealism into the real world.</p>
<p>And he lay awake in his bed for hours remembering 23s that had occurred in
his own life . . . and wondering about the origin of that mysterious bit of 1929
slang, &quot;23 Skidoo. ...&quot;</p>
<p>After being lost for an hour in Hitler's old neighborhood, Clark Kent and His
Supermen finally found <i>Ludwigstrasse </i>and got out of Munich. &quot;About
forty miles and we'll be in Ingolstadt,&quot; Kent-Mohammed-Pearson said. <i>&quot;At
last,&quot; </i>one of the Supermen groaned. Just then a tiny Volkswagen inched
past their VW bus, like an infant running ahead of its mother, and Kent looked
bemused. &quot;Did you check out that cat at the wheel? I saw him once before,
and never forgot it because he was acting so weird. It was in Mexico City. Funny
seeing him again, halfway around the world and umpteen years later.&quot;
&quot;Go catch him,&quot; another Superman commented. &quot;With the AMA and the
Trashers and other heavy groups we're going to get buried alive. Let's make sure
that at least <i>he </i>knows we were in Ingolstadt for this gig.&quot;</p>

<p>The morning after the Wobbly meeting Simon telephoned Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; he asked, &quot;do you have to fly back to New York
today? Can you possibly stay over a night? I've got something I'd like you to
see. It's time we started reaching people in your generation and really showing
you instead of just telling you. Are you game?&quot;</p>
<p>And Joe Malik—ex-Trotskyist, ex-engineering student, ex-liberal,
ex-Catholic—heard himself saying, &quot;Yes.&quot; And heard a louder voice,
unspeaking, uttering a more profound &quot;yes&quot; deep inside himself. He was
game—for astrology, for <i>I</i> <i>Ching, </i>for LSD, for demons, for
whatever</p>
<p>Simon had to offer as an alternative to the world of sane and rational men
who were sanely and rationally plotting their course toward what could only be
the annihilation of the planet.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">(WE SHALL</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">
<b>NOT BE MOVED)</b></span></p>
<p>&quot;God is dead,&quot; the priest chanted.</p>
<p>&quot;God is dead,&quot; the congregation repeated in chorus.</p>
<p>&quot;God is dead: we are all absolutely free,&quot; the priest intoned more
rhythmically.</p>
<p>&quot;God is dead,&quot; the congregation picked up the almost hypnotic beat,
&quot;we are all absolutely free.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe shifted nervously in his chair. The blasphemy was exhilarating, but also
strangely disturbing. He wondered how much fear of Hell still lingered in the
back corridors of his skull, left over from his Catholic boyhood.</p>
<p>They were in an elegant apartment, high above Lake Shore Drive—&quot;We
always meet here,&quot; Simon had explained, &quot;because of the acrostic
significance of the street name&quot;—and the sounds of the automobile traffic
far below mingled strangely with the preparations for what Joe already guessed
was a black Mass.</p>
<p>&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,&quot; the priest
chanted.</p>
<p>&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,&quot; Joe repeated
with the rest of the congregation.</p>
<p>The priest—who was the only one who had not removed his clothes before the
beginning of the ceremony—was a slightly red-faced middle-aged man in a Roman
collar, and part of Joe's discomfort derived from the fact that he looked so
much like every Catholic priest he had known in his childhood, It had not helped
matters that he had given his name, when Simon introduced Joe to him, as
&quot;Padre Pederastia&quot;—which he pronounced with a very campy inflection,
looking flirtatiously directly in Joe's eyes.</p>
<p>The congregation divided, in Joe's mind, into two easily distinguishable
groups: poor full-time hippies, from the Old Town area, and rich part-time
hippies, from Lake Shore Drive itself and, no doubt, also from the local
advertising agencies on Michigan Avenue. There were only eleven of them,
however, including Joe, and Padre Pederastia made twelve—where was the
traditional thirteenth?</p>
<p>&quot;Prepare the pentad,&quot; Padre Pederastia commanded.</p>
<p>Simon and a rather good-looking young female, both quite unself-conscious in
their nakedness, arose and left the group, walking toward the door which Joe had
assumed led to the bedroom area. They stopped to take some chalk from a table on
which hashish and sandal-wood incense were burning in a goafs-head taper, then
squatted to draw a large pentagon on the blood-red rug. A triangle was then
added to each side of the pentagon, forming a star—the special kind of star,
Joe knew, which was known as pentagram, symbol of werewolves and also of demons.
He found himself remembering the cbrny old poem from the Lon Chancy, Jr.,
movies, but it suddenly didn't sound like kitsch anymore:</p>
<p>Even a man who is pure of heart</p>
<p>And says his prayers by night</p>
<p>Can turn to a wolf when the wolfbane blooms</p>
<p>And the autumn moon is bright</p>
<p>&quot;I-O,&quot; the priest chanted raptly.</p>
<p>&quot;I-O,&quot; the chorus came.</p>
<p>&quot;I-O, E-O, Evoe,&quot; the chant rose weirdly.</p>
<p>&quot;I-O, E-O, Evoe,&quot; the rhythmic reply came in cadence.</p>
<p>Joe felt a strange, ashy, acrid taste gathering in his mouth, and a coldness
creeping into his toes and fingers. The air, too, seemed suddenly greasy and
unpleasantly, mucidly moist.</p>
<p>&quot;I-O, E-O, Evoe, HE!&quot; the priest screamed, in fear or in ecstasy.</p>
<p>&quot;I-O, E-O, Evoe, HEr Joe heard himself joining the others. Was it
imagination, or were all their voices subtly changing, in a bestial and pongoid
fashion?</p>
<p>&quot;Ol sonuf vaoresaji,&quot; the priest said, more softly.'</p>
<p>&quot;Ol sonuf vaoresaji,&quot; they chorused.</p>
<p>&quot;It is accomplished,&quot; the priest said. &quot;We may pass the
Guardian.&quot;</p>
<p>The congregation arose and moved toward the door. Each person, Joe noticed,
was careful to step into the pentagram and pause there a moment gathering
strength before actually approaching the door. When it was his turn, he
discovered why. The carving on the door, which had seemed merely obscene and
ghoulish from across the room, was more disturbing when you were closer to it.
It was not easy—to convince yourself that those eyes were just a trick of <i>trompe
I'oeil. </i>The mind insisted on feeling that they very definitely looked at
you, not affectionately, as you passed.</p>
<p>This—<i>thing—</i>was the Guardian which had to be pacified before they
could enter the next room.</p>
<p>Joe's fingers and toes were definitely freezing, and auto-suggestion didn't
seem a very plausible explanation. He seriously wondered about the possibility
of frostbite. But then he stepped into the pentagram and the cold suddenly
decreased, the eyes of the Guardian were less menacing, and a feeling of renewed
energy flowed through his body, such as he had experienced in a
sensitivity-training session after he had been cajoled by the leader into
unleashing a great deal of pent-up anxiety and rage by kicking, screaming,
weeping, and cursing.</p>
<p>He passed the Guardian easily and entered the room where the real action
would occur.</p>
<p>It was as if he had left the twentieth century. The furnishings and the very
architecture were Hebraic, Arabic, and medieval European, all mixed together in
a most disorienting way, and entirely unrelieved by any trace of the modern or
functional.</p>
<p>A black-draped altar stood in the center, and upon it lay the thirteenth
member of the coven. She was a woman with red hair and green eyes—the traits
which Satan supposedly relished most in mortal females. (There had been a time,
Joe remembered, when any woman having those features was automatically suspected
of witchcraft.) She was, of course, naked, and her body would be the medium
through which this strange sacrament would be attempted.</p>
<p><i>What am I doing here? </i>Joe thought frantically. <i>Why don't 1 leave
these lunatics and get back to the world I know, the world where all the horrors
are, after all, merely human?</i></p>
<p>But he knew the answer.</p>
<p>He could not—literally could not—attempt to pass the Guardian until all
those present gave their consent.</p>
<p>Padre Pederastia was speaking. &quot;This part of the ceremony,&quot; he
said, camping outrageously, &quot;is very distasteful to me, as you all know. If
only Our Father Below would allow us to substitute a boy on the altar when I'm
officiating—but, alas, He is, as we all know, very rigid about such things. As
usual, therefore, I will ask the newest member to take my place for this
rite.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe knew, from the <i>Malleus malificarum </i>and other gri-moires, what the
rite was, and he was both excited and frightened.</p>
<p>He approached the altar nervously, noting the others forming a pentagon
around the nude woman and himself. She had a lovely body with large breasts and
fine nipples, but he was still too nervous to become aroused physically.</p>
<p>Padre Pederastia handed him the Host. &quot;I stole this from the church
myself,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You can be sure it is fully consecrated and
completely potent. You know what to do?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe nodded, unable to meet the priest's lascivious eyes.</p>
<p>He took the Host and spat upon it quickly.</p>
<p>The greasiness and electrically charged quality of the air seemed to increase
sharply. The light seemed harsher, like the glint of a sword, just as
schizophrenics often described light as a hostile or destructive force.</p>
<p>He stepped forward and placed the Host upon the thighs of the Bride of Satan.</p>
<p>Immediately, she moaned softly, as if the simple touch were more erotic than
one momentary contact could possibly be. Her legs spread voluptuously and the
middle of the Host crumpled as it sunk slightly into her red pubic hair. The
effect was, at once, powerful; her whole body shuddered and the Host was drawn
farther into her obviously moist cunt. Using his ringer, Joe pushed it the rest
of the way in, and she began breathing in a hoarse staccato rhythm.</p>
<p>Joe Malik knelt to complete the rite. He felt like a fool and a pervert; he
had never performed oral sex, or any kind of sex, in front of an audience
before. He wasn't even turned on erotically. He went ahead just to find out if
there was any real magic in this revolting lunacy.</p>
<p>As soon as his tongue entered her, she began heaving and he knew her first
orgasm would arrive rapidly. His penis finally began swelling; he began licking
the Host caressingly. Inside his temple, a drum seemed to be beating hollowly;
he hardly noticed it when she came. His senses spun and he licked more, aware
only that she flowed more heavily and thickly than any woman he had known. He
put his thumb in her anus, and his middle finger in her vagina, keeping his
tongue in the clitoral area, doing it up right—this was the technique
occultists call the Rite of Shiva. (Irreverently, he remembered that</p>
<p>swingers call it the One-Man Band.) He felt an unusual electrical quality in
her pubic hair and was aware of a heaviness and tension in his penis more
powerful than he had ever known in his life, but all else was drowned out by the
drumming in his head, the cunt-taste, cunt-smell, cunt-warmth. . . . She was
Ishtar, Aphrodite, Venus; the experience was so intense he began to feel a real
religious dimension to it. Hadn't some nineteenth century anthropologist argued
that cunt-worship was the earliest religion? He didn't even know this woman and
yet he had an emotion beyond love: true reverence. <i>Trippy, </i>as Simon would
say.</p>
<p>How many times she came, he never knew; he came himself, without once
touching his penis, when the Host was finally dissolved.</p>
<p>He staggered back dizzily, and the air now seemed as resistant to motion as
brackish water.</p>
<p>&quot;Yogge Sothothe Neblod Zin,&quot; the priest began chanting. &quot;By
Ashtoreth, by Pan Pangenitor, by the Yellow Sign, by the gifts I have made and
the powers I have purchased, by He Who Is Not to Be Named, by Rabban and by
Azathoth, by Samma-El, by Amon and Ra, <i>vente, vente, Lucifer, lux fiat!&quot;</i></p>
<p>Joe never saw it: he <i>felt </i>it—and it was like chemical Mace, blinding
and numbing him at once.</p>
<p>&quot;Come not in that form!&quot; the priest screamed. &quot;By Jesu Elohim
and the Powers that You fear, I command thee: come not in that form! <i>Yod He
Vah He—</i>come not in that form.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the women began weeping in fear.</p>
<p>&quot;Quiet, you fool,&quot; Simon shouted at her. &quot;Don't give it more
Power.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your tongue is bound, until I release it,&quot; the priest said to
her—but the distraction of his attention had its cost; Joe <i>felt </i>It
growing in potency again, and so did the others, judging from their sudden
involuntary gasps.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Come not in that form!&quot; </i>the priest shouted. &quot;By the
Cross of Gold, and by the Rose of Ruby, and by Mary's Son, I command and demand
it of thee: come not in that form! By thy Master, Chronzon! By Pangenitor and
Panphage, come not in that form!&quot;</p>
<p>There was a hiss, like air pouring into a vacuum, and the atmosphere began to
clear—but it also dropped abruptly in temperature.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">MASTER, CALL NO MORE UPON THOSE NAMES. I
MEANT NOT TO ALARM THEE.</span></b></p>
<p>The Voice was the most shocking experience of the night for Joe. It was oily,
flattering, obscenely humble, but there was still within it a secret strength
that revealed all too well that the priest's power over it, however obtained,
was temporary, that both of them knew it, and that the price of that power was
something it longed to collect</p>
<p>&quot;Come not in that form either,&quot; said the priest, more stern and
more confident. &quot;Ye know full well that such tones and manners are also
intended to frighten, and I like not such jokes. Come in this form which thou
habitually wearest in thy current earthly activities, or I shall banish thee
back to that realm of which you like not to imagine. I command. I command. I
command.&quot; There was nothing campy about the Padre now.</p>
<p>It was just a room again—an odd, medieval, mideastern room, but just a
room. The figure that stood among them could not have looked less like a demon.</p>
<p>&quot;OK,&quot; it said in a pleasant American voice, &quot;we don't have to
get touchy and hostile with each other over a little theatrics, do we? Just tell
me what sort of business 'transaction you went and dragged me here for, and I'm
sure we can work out all the details in a down-home, businesslike,
cards-on-the-table fashion, with no hard feelings and mutual satisfaction all
around.&quot;</p>
<p>It looked like Billy Graham.</p>
<p>(&quot;The Kennedys? Martin Luther King? You are fantastically naive still,
George. It goes back much, much farther.&quot; Hagbard was relaxing with some
Alamout Black hash, after the Battle of Atlantis. &quot;Look at the pictures of
Woodrow Wilson in his last months: The haggard look, the vague eyes, and, in

to him at Versailles. Or look into the Lincoln caper. Who opposed the greenback

Stanton the banker. And turned it over to the Archives with seventeen pages
missing? Stanton the banker. George, you have so much to learn about real
history. . . .&quot;)</p>
<p>The Reverend William Helmer, religious columnist for <i>Confrontation, </i>stared
at the telegram. Joe Malik was supposed to be in Chicago covering the SDS
convention; what was he doing in Providence, Rhode Island, and what was he
involved in that could provoke such an extraordinary communication? Helmer
reread the telegram carefully:</p>
<p>Drop next month's column. Will pay large bonus for prompt answers to these
questions. First, trace all movements of Reverend Billy Graham during last week
and find out if he could possibly have gotten to Chicago surreptitiously.
Second, send me a list of reliable books on Satanism and witchcraft in the
modern world. Tell nobody else on the magazine about this. Wire me c/o Jerry
Mallory, Hotel Benefit, Providence, Rhode Island. P.S. find out where The John
Dillinger Died for You Society has its headquarters. Joe Malik.</p>
<p>Those SDS kids must have turned him on with acid, Helmer decided. Well, he
was still the boss, and he paid nice bonuses when he was pleased. Helmer reached
for the phone.</p>
<p>(Howard, the dolphin, was singing a very satirical song about sharks, as he
swam to meet the <i>Lief Erikson </i>at Peos.)</p>
<p><i>James Walking Bear had no great love for palefaces most of the time, but
he had just dropped six peyote buttons before this Professor Mallory arrived and
he </i>was <i>feeling benevolent and forgiving. </i>After all, the Road Chief
once said at a very sacred midsummer peyote festival that the line about
forgiving <i>those who trespass against us </i>had a special meaning for
Indians. Only when we all forgave the whites, he had said, would our hearts be
totally pure, and when our hearts were pure the Curse would be lifted—the
white men would cease to trespass, go home to Europe, and vex one another
instead of persecuting us. James tried to forgive the professor for being white
and found, as usual, that peyote made forgiveness easier.</p>
<p>&quot;Billie Freschette?&quot; he said. &quot;Hell, she died back in
sixty-eight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know that,&quot; the professor said. &quot;What I'm looking for is
any photographs she may have left.&quot;</p>
<p>Sure. James knew what kind of photographs.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean ones that had Dillinger in them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, she was his mistress, virtually his common-law wife, for a long
time, and—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No soap. You're years too late. Reporters bought up everything she had
that showed even the back of Dillinger's head, way back, long before she came
here to the reservation to die.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, did you know her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot; James was careful not be spiteful and didn't add: all
Menominee Indians know one another, in a way you whites can't understand
&quot;knowing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did she ever converse about Dillinger?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. Old women always talk about their dead men. Always say the
same thing, too: never was another man as good as him. Except when they say
there never was another man as bad as him. They only say that when they're
drunk, though.&quot;</p>
<p>The paleface kept turning colors, the way people do when you're on peyote.
Now he looked almost like an Indian. That made it easier to talk to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Did she ever say anything about John's attitude toward the
Masons?&quot;</p>
<p>Why shouldn't people turn colors? All the trouble in world came from the fact
that they usually stayed the same color. James nodded profoundly. As usual,
peyote had brought him a big Truth. If whites and blacks and Indians were
turning colors all the time, there wouldn't be any hate in the world, because
nobody would know which people to hate.</p>
<p>&quot;I said, did she ever mention John's attitude toward the Masons?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Oh, yes. Funny you should ask that.&quot; The man had a halo around
his head now, and James wondered what that meant. Every time he took peyote
alone things like that would happen, and he'd end up wishing there were a Road
Chief or some other priest around to explain these signs properly. But what
about the Masons? Oh, yes. &quot;Billie said the Masons were the only people
John Dillinger really hated. He said they railroaded him to prison the first
time, and they owned all the banks, so he was getting even by robbing
them.&quot;</p>
<p>The professor's mouth dropped open in surprise and delight—and James
thought it was kind of funny to see that, especially with the halo turning from
pink to blue to pink to blue to pink again at the same time.</p>

<p>When Joe Malik got off the plane at Los Angeles International Airport, Simon
was waiting for him.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll talk in your car,&quot; Joe said briefly.</p>
<p>The car, being Simon's, was naturally a psychedelic Volkswagen.
&quot;Well?&quot; he asked as they drove out of the airport onto Central Avenue.</p>
<p>&quot;It all checks out,&quot; Joe said with an odd calm. &quot;It did rain
blue cats when they dug up Tlaloc. Mexico City has had unusual and unseasonable
rains ever since. The missing tooth was on the right, and the corpse at the
Biograph Theatre had a missing tooth on the left. Billy Graham couldn't have
gotten to Chicago by any normal means, so that was either the best damned makeup
job in the history of show business and plastic surgery or I witnessed a genuine
miracle. And all the rest of it, the law of Fives and all. I'm sold. I no longer
claim membership in the liberal intellectual guild. You behold in me a horrible
example of creeping mysticism.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ready to try acid?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Joe said. &quot;I'm ready to try acid. I only regret that I
have but one mind to lose for my Shivadarshana.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right on! First, though, you'll meet <i>him. </i>I'll drive right to
his bungalow—it's not far from here.&quot; Simon began humming as he drove;
Joe recognized the tune as the Fugs' &quot;Rameses II Is Dead, My Love.&quot;</p>
<p>They drove for a while in silence, and Joe finally asked, &quot;How old is .
. . our little group . . . exactly?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since 1888.&quot; Simon said. &quot;That's when Rhodes horned in and
they 'kicked out the Jams,' like I told you in Chicago after the Sabbath.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Karl Marx?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A schmuck. A dupe. A nebbish from the word Go.&quot; Simon made an
abrupt turn. &quot;Here we are at his house. The greatest headache they had
since Harry Houdini knocked out their spiritualist fronts.&quot; He grinned.
&quot;How do you think you'll feel talking to a dead man?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Weird,&quot; Joe said, &quot;but I've felt weird for the last week and
a half.&quot;</p>
<p>Simon parked the car and held the door open. &quot;Just think,&quot; he said.
&quot;Hoover sitting there every day with the death-mask on his desk, and
half-suspecting, deep down in his bones, how we suckered him.&quot;</p>
<p>They crossed the yard of the small, modest bungalow. &quot;What a front,
eh?&quot; Simon chuckled. He knocked.</p>
<p>A little old man—he was five foot seven exactly, Joe remembered from the
FBI files—opened the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Here's our new recruit,&quot; Simon said simply.</p>
<p>&quot;Come in,&quot; John Dillinger said, &quot;and tell me how an asshole
egghead like you can help us beat the shit out of those motherfucking Illuminati
cocksuckers.&quot;</p>
<p>(&quot;They fill their books with obscene words, claiming that this is
realism,&quot; Smiling Jim shouted to the KCUF assembly. &quot;It's not my idea
of realism. I don't know anybody who talks in that gutter language they call
realism. And they describe every possible perversion, acts against nature that
are so outrageous I wouldn't sully this audiences' ears by even mentioning their
medical names. Some of them even glorify the criminal and the anarchist. I'd
like to see one of these hacks come up to me and look me in the eye and say, 'I
didn't do it for money. I was honestly trying to tell a good, honest story that
would teach people something of value.' They couldn't say that. The lie would
stick in their throats. Who can doubt where they get their orders from? What
person in this audience needs to be told what group is behind this overflowing
sewer of smut and filth?&quot;)</p>
<p><i>&quot;May storms and rains and typhoons beat them,&quot; Howard sang on.
&quot;May Great Cthulhu rise and eat them&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;I got into the JAMs in Michigan City Prison,&quot; Diffin-ger, much
relaxed and less arrogant, was saying as he, Simon, and Joe sat in his living
room drinking Black Russians.</p>
<p>&quot;And Hoover knew, from the beginning?&quot; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. I wanted the bastard to know—him and every other
high-ranking Mason and Rosicrucian and Illuminati front-man in the
country.&quot; The old man laughed harshly; except for his unmistakable eyes,
which still held the strange blend of irony and intensity that Joe had noted in
the 1930s photos, he was indistinguishable from any other elderly fellow who had
come to California to enjoy his last years in the sun. &quot;The first bank job
I pulled off, in Daleville, Indiana, I used the line that I always repeated:
'Lie down on the floor and keep calm.' Hoover couldn't miss it. That's been the
motto of the JAMs ever since Diogenes the Cynic. He knew no ordinary bank robber
would be quoting an obscure Greek philosopher. The reason I repeated it on every
heist was just to rub it in and let him know I was taunting him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But going back to Michigan City Prison . . .&quot; Joe prompted,
sipping his drink.</p>
<p>&quot;Pierpont was the one who initiated me. He'd been with the JAMs for
years by then. I was just a kid, you know—in my early twenties—rand I had
only pulled one job, a real botch. I couldn't understand why I got such a stiff
sentence, after the D.A. promised me clemency if I'd plead guilty, and I was
kind of bitter. But old Harry Pierpont saw my potential.</p>
<p>&quot;At first I thought he was just another big-house faggot, when he
started tracking me around and asking me all sorts of personal questions. But he
was what I wanted to become—a successful bank-robber—so I played along. To
tell you the truth, I was so horny it wouldn't have mattered if he was a faggot.
You have no idea how horny a man gets in prison. That's why Baby-Face Nelson and
a lot of other guys preferred to die rather than go back to the big house again.
Hell, if you haven't been there, you can't understand. You just don't know what
being horny <i>is.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Well, anyway, after a lot of bull about Jesus and Jehovah and the Bible
and all that, Harry just asked me point-blank one day in the prison yard: 'Do
you think it's possible there might be a true religion?' I was about to say,
'Bullshit—like there might be an honest cop,' but something stopped me. I
realized he was dead serious, and a lot might depend on my answer. So I was
cautious. I said, 'If there is, I haven't heard about it.' And he just came
back, real quiet, 'Most people haven't.'</p>
<p>&quot;It was a couple of days afterward that he brought the subject up again.
Then, he went right on with it, showed me the Sacred Chao and everything. It
took my breath away.&quot; The old man's voice trailed off, as he sank into
silent memories.</p>
<p>&quot;And it really does go back to Babylon?&quot; Joe prompted.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not much of an intellectual,&quot; Dillinger replied. &quot;Action
is my arena. Let Simon tell you that part.&quot;</p>
<p>Simon was eager to leap into the breach. &quot;The basic book to confirm our
tradition,&quot; he said, &quot;is <i>The Seven</i></p>
<p><i>Tablets of Creation, </i>which is dated at about 2500 B.C. the time of
Sargon. It describes how Tiamat and Apsu, the first gods, were coexisting in
Mummu, the primordial chaos. Von Junzt, in his <i>Unausprechlichen Kulten, </i>tells
how the Justified Ancients of Mummu originated, just about the time the <i>Seven
Tablets </i>were inscribed. You see, under Sargon, the chief deity was Marduk. I
mean, that was what the high priests gave out to the public—in private, of
course, they worshipped lok-Sotot, who became the Yog-Sothoth of the <i>Necronomicon.
</i>But maybe I'm going too fast. Getting back to the official religion of
Marduk, it was based on usury. The priests monopolized the medium of exchange
and were able to extract interest for lending it. They also monopolized the
land, and extracted tribute for renting it. It was the beginning of what we
laughingly call civilization, which has always rested on rent and interest. The
old Babylonian con.</p>
<p>&quot;The official story was that Mummu was dead, killed in the war between
the gods. When the first anarchist group arose, they called themselves Justified
Ancients of Mummu. Like Lao-Tse and the Taoists in China, they wanted to get rid
of usury and monopoly and all the other pigshit of civilization and go back to a
natural way of life. So, grok, they took the supposedly dead god, Mummu, and
claimed he was still alive and was actually stronger than all the other gods.
They had a good argument 'Look around,' they'd say, &quot;what do you see most
of? Chaos, right? Therefore, the god of Chaos is the strongest god, and is still
alive.'</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, we got our ass whipped good. We were just no match for the
Illuminati in those days. Didn't have a clue, about how they performed their
'miracles,' for instance. So we got our asses whipped again, in Greece, when the
JAMs got started again, as part of the Cynic movement. By the tune the whole
thing was happening again in Rome—usury and monopoly and the whole bag of
tricks—the truce took place. The Justified Ancients became part of the
Illuminati, a special group still keeping our own name, but taking orders from
the Five. We thought we'd humanize them, like the anarchists who stayed in SDS
after last year. And so it went until 1888. Then Cecil Rhodes started the Circle
of Initiates and the big schism occurred. Every meeting would have a faction of
Rhodes boys carrying signs that said 'Kick out the JAMs!' It was the parting of
the ways. They just didn't trust us—or maybe they were afraid of being
humanized.</p>
<p>&quot;But we had learned a lot by our long participation in the Illuminati
conspiracy, and now we know how to fight them with their own weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck their weapons,&quot; Dillinger interrupted. &quot;I like to fight
them with <i>my </i>weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You <i>are </i>behind the big unsolved bank robberies of the last few
years—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. Just in the planning, though. I'm too old to vault over tellers'
cages and carry on like I did back in the thirties.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;John is also fighting on another front,&quot; Simon interjected.</p>
<p>Dillinger laughed. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm the president of
Laughing Buddha Jesus Phallus Inc. You've seen them— 'If it's not an LBJP it's
NOT an L.P.'?</p>
<p>&quot;Laughing Buddha Jesus Phallus?&quot; Joe exclaimed. &quot;My God, you
put out the best rock in the country! The only rock a man my age can listen to
without wincing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Dillinger said modestly. &quot;Actually, the Illuminati
own the companies that put out <i>most </i>of the rock. We started Laughing
Buddha Jesus Phallus to counterattack. We were ignoring that front until they
got the MC-5 to cut a disc called 'Kick Out The Jams' just to taunt us with old,
bitter memories. So we came back with our own releases, and the next thing I
knew I was making bales of money from it. We've also fed information, through
third parties, to Christian Crusade in Tulsa, Oklahoma, so they could expose
some of what the Illuminati are doing in the rock field. You've seen the
Christian Crusade publications—<i>Rhythm, Riots and Revolution, </i>and <i>Communism,
Hypnotism and the Beatles, </i>and so forth?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Joe said absently. &quot;I thought it was nut literature.
It's so hard,&quot; he added, &quot;to grasp the whole picture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'll get used to it,&quot; Simon smiled. &quot;It just takes awhile
to sink in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who really did shoot John Kennedy?&quot; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Dillinger said. &quot;You're only a private in our
army right now. Not cleared for that kind of information yet. I'll just tell you
this much: his initials are H.C.—so don't trust anybody with those initials,
no matter where or how you meet him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's being fair,&quot; Simon told Joe. &quot;You'll appreciate it
later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And advancement is rapid,&quot; Dillinger added, &quot;and the rewards
are beyond your present understanding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give him a hint, John,&quot; Simon suggested with an anticipatory grin.
&quot;Tell him how you got out of Crown Point Jail.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've read two versions of that,&quot; Joe said. &quot;Most of the
sources claim you carved a fake gun out of balsa wood and dyed it black with
your shoe polish. Toland's book says that you made that story up and leaked it
out to protect the man who really managed the break for you—a federal judge
that you bribed to smuggle in a real gun. Which was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither,&quot; Dillinger said. &quot;Crown Point was known as the
'escape-proof jail' before I crashed out of it, and, believe me, it deserved the
name. Do you want to know how I did it? I walked through the walls. Listen. . .
.&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">HARE KRISHNA HARE HARE</span></b></p>
<p><i>The sun beat down on the town of Daleville on July 17, 1933, like a rain
of fire.</i></p>
<p><i>Motoring down the main street, John Dillinger felt the perspiration on his
neck. Although he had been paroled three weeks earlier, he was still pale from
his nine years in prison, and the sunlight was cruel on his almost albino-tinted
skin.</i></p>
<p>I'm going to have to walk through that door all by myself, he thought. All
alone.</p>
<p>And fighting every kind of fear and guilt that has been beaten into me from
childhood on.</p>
<p>'The spirit of Mummu is stronger than the Illuminati's technology,&quot;
Pierpont had said. &quot;Remember that. We've got the Second Law of
Thermodynamics on our side. Chaos steadily increases, all over the universe. All
'law and order' is a kind of temporary accident.&quot;</p>
<p>But I've got to walk through that door all alone. The Secret of the Five
depends on it. This time it's my turn to be the goat.</p>
<p>Pierpont and Van Meter and the others were still back in Michigan City
Prison. It was all in his hands—being the first one paroled, he had to raise
the money to finance the jail-break that would get the others out. Then, having
proved himself, he would be taught the JAM &quot;miracles.&quot;</p>
<p>The bank suddenly loomed before him. Too suddenly. His heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Then, calmly, he drove his Chevrolet coupe over to the curb and parked.</p>
<p>I should have prepared better. This car should be souped-up like the ones
Clyde Barrow uses. Well, I'll know that the next time.</p>
<p>He left his hands on the steering wheel and squeezed, hard. He took a deep
breath and repeated the Formula: &quot;23 Skidoo.&quot;</p>
<p>It helped a little—but he still wanted to get the hell out of there. He
wanted to drive straight back to his father's farm in Mooresville and find a job
and learn all the straight things again, how to kiss a boss's ass and how to
look the parole officer straight in the eye and be like everybody else.</p>
<p>But everybody else was an Illuminati puppet and didn't know it. He did know
it and was going to liberate himself.</p>
<p>Hell, that's what a younger John Dillinger thought back in 1924—except that
he hadn't known about the Illuminati or the JAMs, then—but he was trying to
liberate himself, in his own way, when he held up that grocer. And what did it
lead to? Nine years of misery and monotony and almost going mad with horniness
in a stinking cell.</p>
<p>It'll be nine years more if I fuck up today.</p>
<p>&quot;The spirit of Mummu is stronger than the Illuminati's technology.&quot;</p>
<p>He got out of the car and forced his feet and legs to move and he walked
straight for the bank door.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck it,&quot; he said, &quot;23 Skidoo.&quot;</p>
<p>He walked through the door—and then he did the thing the bank tellers
remembered after and told the police. He reached up and adjusted his straw hat
to the most dapper and debonair angle—and he grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, this is a stick-up,&quot; he said clearly, taking out his
pistol. &quot;Everybody lie down on the floor and keep calm. None of you will
get hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, God,&quot; a female teller gasped, &quot;don't shoot. Please don't
shoot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry, honey,&quot; John Dillinger said easily, &quot;I don't
want to hurt anybody. Just open the vault.&quot;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">LIKE A TREE THAT'S PLANTED BV THE WATER</span></b></p>
<p><i>&quot;That afternoon,&quot; the old man said, &quot;I met Calvin Coolidge
in the woods near my father's farm at Mooresville. I gave him the haul—twenty
thousand dollars</i>—<i>and it went into the JAM treasury. He gave me twenty
tons of hempscript.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Calvin Coolidge?&quot; Joe Malik exclaimed.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Well, of course, I knew it wasn't really Calvin Coolidge. But that was
the form he chose to appear in. Who or what he really is, I haven't learned <i>yet.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;You met him in Chicago,&quot; Simon added gleefully. &quot;He appeared
as Billy Graham that time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean the Dev—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Satan,&quot; Simon said simply &quot;is just another of the innumerable
masks he wears. Behind the mask is a man and behind the man is another mask.
It's all a matter of merging multiverses, remember? Don't look for an Ultimate
Reality. There isn't any.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then this person—this being—&quot; Joe protested, &quot;really is
supernatural—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Supernatural, schmupernatural,&quot; Simon grimaced. &quot;You're still
like the people in that mathematical parable about Flatland. You can only think
in categories of right and left, and I'm talking about <i>up </i>and <i>down, </i>so
you say 'supernatural.' There is no 'supernatural'; there are just more
dimensions than you are accustomed to, that's all. If you were living in
Flatland and I stepped out of your plane into a plane at a different angle, it
would look to you as if I vanished 'into thin air.' Somebody looking down from
our three-dimensional viewpoint would see me going off at a tangent from you,
and would wonder why you were acting so distressed and surprised about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the flash of light—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's an energy transformation,&quot; Simon explained patiently.
&quot;Look, the reason you can only think three-dimensionally is because there
are only three directions in cubical space. That's why the Illuminati—and some
of the kids they've allowed to become partially illuminized lately—refer to
ordinary science as 'square.' The basic energy-vector coordinates of Universe
are five-dimensional—of course—and can best be visualized in terms of the
five sides of the Illuminati Pyramid of Egypt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Five sides?&quot; Joe objected. &quot;It only has four.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're ignoring the bottom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Go on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Energy is always triangular, not cubical. Bucky Fuller has a line on
this, by the way: he's the first one outside the Illuminati to discover it
independently. The basic energy transformation we're concerned with is the one
Fuller hasn't discovered yet, although he's said he's looking for it—the one
that ties Mind into the matter-energy continuum. The pyramid is the key. You
take a man in the lotus position and draw lines from his pineal gland—the
Third Eye, as the Buddhists call it—to his two knees, and from each knee to
the other, and this is what you get. . . .&quot; Simon sketched rapidly in his
notepad and passed it over to Joe:</p>

<p>&quot;When the Pineal Eye opens—after fear is conquered; that is, after
your first Bad Trip—you can control the energy field entirely,&quot; Simon
went on. &quot;An Irish Illuminatus of the ninth century, Scotus Ergina, put it
very simply—in five words, of course—when he said <i>Omnia quia sunt, lumina
sunt: </i>'All things that are, are lights.' Einstein also put it into five
symbols when he wrote <i>e = mc<sup>2</sup>?. </i>The actual transformation
doesn't require atomic reactors and all that jazz, once you learn how to control
the mind vectors, but it always lets off one hell of a flash of light, as John
can tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damn near blinded me and knocked me on my ass, that first time in the
woods,&quot; Dillinger agreed. &quot;But I was sure glad to know the trick. I
was never afraid of being arrested after that, 'cause I could always walk out of
any jail they put me in. That's why the Feds decided to kill me, you know. It
was embarrassing to always find me wandering around loose again a few days after
they locked me up. You know the background to the Biograph Theatre scam—they
killed three guys in Chicago, without giving them a chance to surrender, because
they thought I was one of them. Well, those three were all wanted in New York
for armed robbery, so nobody criticized the cops much for that caper. But then
up in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, they shot three very respectable businessmen, and
one of <i>them </i>went and died, and Hoover's Heroes caught all sorts of crap
from the newspapers. So I knew where it was at; I could never again surrender
and walk away a few days later. We had to produce a body for them.&quot; The old
man looked suddenly sad. &quot;There was one possibility that we hated to think
about. . . . But, luckily it didn't come to that. The gimmick we finally worked
out was perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And everything really follows the Fives' law?&quot; Joe asked.</p>
<p>&quot;More than you guess,&quot; Dillinger remarked blandly.</p>
<p>&quot;Even when you're dealing with social fields,&quot; Simon added.
&quot;We've run studies of cultures where the Illuminati were not in control,
and they still follow Weishaupt's five-stage pattern: <i>Verwirrung, zweitracht,
Unordnung, Beamtenherrschaft </i>and <i>Grummet. </i>That is: chaos, discord,
confusion, bureaucracy, and aftermath. America right now is between the fourth
and fifth stages. Or you might say that the older generation is mostly in <i>Beamtenherrschaft
</i>and the younger generation is moving into <i>Grummet </i>rapidly.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe took another stiff drink and shook his head. &quot;But why do they leave
so much of it out in the open? I mean, not merely the really shocking things you
told me about the Bugs Bunny cartoons, but putting the pyramid on the dollar
bill where everybody sees it almost every day—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hell,&quot; Simon said, &quot;look what Beethoven did when Weishaupt
illuminated him. Went right home and wrote the Fifth Symphony. You know how it
begins: da-da-da-DUM. Morse code for <i>V—</i>the Roman numeral for five.
Right out in the open, as you say. It amuses the devil out of them to confirm
their low opinion of the rest of humanity by putting things up front like that
and watching how almost everybody misses it. Of course, if somebody doesn't miss
something, they recruit him right away. Look at Genesis: 'lux fiat'—right on
the first page. They do it all the time. The Pentagon Building. '23 Skidoo.' The
lyrics of rock songs like 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'— how obvious can you
get? Melville was one of the most outrageous of the bunch; the very first
sentence of <i>Moby Dick </i>tells you he's a disciple of Hassan i Sabbah, but
you cant find a single Melville scholar who has followed up that lead—in spite
of Ahab being a truncated anagram of Sabbah. He even tells you, again and again,
directly and indirectly, that Moby Dick and Leviathan are the same creature, and
that Moby Dick is often seen at the same time in two different parts of the
world, but not one reader in a million groks what he's hinting at. There's a
whole chapter on whiteness and why white is really more terrifying than black; <i>all
</i>the critics miss the point&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; 'Osiris is a black god,' &quot; Joe quoted.</p>
<p>&quot;Right on! You're going to advance fast,&quot; Simon said
enthusiastically. &quot;In fact, J think it's time for you to get off the verbal
level and really confront your own 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'—your own
lady Isis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Dillinger said. &quot;The <i>Leif Erikson </i>is laying
offshore near California right now; Hagbard is running some hashish to the
students at Berkeley. He's got a new black chick in his crew who plays the Lucy
role extremely well. We'll have him send her ashore for the Rite. I suggest that
you two drive up to the Norton Lodge in Frisco and I'll arrange for her to meet
you there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like dealing with Hagbard,&quot; Simon said. &quot;He's a
right-wing nut, and so is his whole gang.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's one of the best allies we have against the Illuminati,&quot;
Dillinger said. &quot;Besides, I want to exchange some hempscript for some of
his flaxscript. Right now, the Mad Dog bunch won't accept anything but
flaxscript—they think Nixon is really going to knock the bottom out of the
hemp market. And you know what they do with Federal Reserve notes. Every time
they get one, they burn it. Instant demurrage, they call it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Puerile,&quot; Simon pronounced. &quot;It will take decades to
undermine the Fed that way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Dillinger said, &quot;Those are the kinds of people we have
to deal with. The JAMs can't do it all alone, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Simon shrugged. &quot;But it bugs me.&quot; He stood up and
put his drink on the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's go,&quot; he said to Joe. &quot;You're going to be illuminized.&quot;</p>
<p>Dillinger accompanied them to the door, then leaned close to Joe and said,
&quot;A word of advice about the Rite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>Dillinger lowered his voice. &quot;Lie down on the floor and keep calm,&quot;
he said, and his old, impudent grin flashed wickedly.</p>
<p>Joe stood there looking at the mocking bandit, and it seemed to him a freeze
and a frieze in time: a moment that would linger, as another stage of
illumination, forever in his mind. Sister Cecilia, back in Resurrection School,
spoke out of the abyss of memory: &quot;Stand in the corner, Joseph Malik!&quot;
And he remembered too, the chalk that he crumbled slowly between his fingers,
the feeling of needing to urinate, the long wait, and then Father Volpe entering
the classroom, his voice like thunder: &quot;Where is he? Where is the boy who
dared to disagree with the good Sister that God sent to instruct him?&quot; And
the other children, led out of the classroom and across the street to the church
to pray for his soul, while the priest harangued him: &quot;Do you know how hot
hell is? Do you know how hot the worst part of hell is? That's where they send
people who have the good fortune to be born into the church and then rebel
against it, misled by Pride of Intellect.&quot; <i>And five years later, those
two faces came back: the priest, angry and dogmatic, demanding obedience, and
the bandit, sardonic, encouraging cynicism, and Joe understood that he might
someday have to kill Hagbard Celine. But more years had to pass, and the
Fernando Poo incident had to pass, and Joe had to plan the bombing of his own
magazine with Tobias Knight before he knew that he would, in fact, kill Celine
without compunction if it were necessary. . </i>. .</p>
<p>But on March 31, in that year of fruition for all the IIluminati's plans,
while the President of the United States went on the air to threaten
&quot;all-out thermonuclear heck,&quot; a young lady named Concepcion Galore lay
nude on a bed in the Hotel Durrutti in Santa Isobel and said, &quot;It's a
lloigor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's a lloigor?&quot; asked her companion, an Englishman named
Fission Chips, who had been born on Hiroshima Day and named by a father who
cared more for physics than for the humanities.</p>
<p>The room was in the luxury suite of the Hotel Durrutti, which meant that it
was decorated in abominable Spanish-Moorish decor, the sheets were changed daily
(to a less luxurious suite), the cockroaches were minimal, and the plumbing
sometimes worked. Concepcion contemplated the bullfight mural on the opposite
wall, Manolete turning an elegant <i>Veronica </i>on an unconvincingly drawn
bull, and said thoughtfully, &quot;Oh, a lloigor is a god of the black people.
The natives. A very bad god.&quot;</p>
<p>Chips glanced at the statue again and said, more to himself than to the
peasant girl, &quot;Looks vaguely like Tlaloc in Mexico City, crossed with one
of those Polynesian Cthulhu <i>tikis.&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;The Starry Wisdom people are very interested in these statues,&quot;
Concepcion said, just to be making conversation, since it was obvious that Chips
wasn't going to be ready to prong her again for at least another half hour.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed?&quot; Chips said, equally bored. &quot;Who are the Starry
Wisdom people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A church. Down on Tequilla y Mota Street. What used to be Lumumba
Street and was Franco Street when I was a girl. Funny church.&quot; The girl
frowned, thinking about them. &quot;When I worked in the telegraph office I was
always seeing their telegrams. All in code. And never to another church. Always
to banks all over Europe and North and South America.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't say,&quot; drawled Chips, no longer bored but trying to sound
casual; his code number in British Intelligence was, of course, 00005. &quot;Why
are they interested in these statues?&quot; He was thinking that statues,
properly hollowed out, could transport heroin; he was already sure that Starry
Wisdom was a front for BUGGER.</p>
<p>(In 1933, at Harvard, Professor Tochus told his Psychology 101 class,
&quot;Now, the child feels frightened and inferior, according to Adler, because
he is, in fact, physically smaller and weaker than the adult. Thus, he knows he
has no chance of successful rebellion, but nevertheless he dreams about it. This
is the origin of the Oedipus Complex in Adler's system: not sex, but the will to
power itself. The class will readily see the influence of Neitzsche . . .&quot;
Robert Putney Drake, glancing around the room, was quite sure that most of the
students would not readily see <i>anything; </i>and Tochus himself didn't
really' see either. The child, Drake had decided—it was the cornerstone of his
own system of psychology—was not brainwashed by sentimentality, religion,
ethics, and other bullshit. The child saw clearly that, in every relationship,
there is a dominant party and a submissive party. And the child, in its quite
correct egotism, determined to become the dominant party. It was that simple;
except, of course, that the brainwashing takes effect eventually in most cases
and, by about this time, the college years, most of them were ready to become
robots and accept the submissive role. Professor Tochus droned on; and Drake,
serene in his lack of superego, continued to dream of how he would seize the
dominant role. ... In New York, Arthur Flegenheimer, Drake's psychic twin, stood
before seventeen robed figures, one wearing a goafs-head mask, and repeated,
&quot;I will forever hele, always conceal, never reveal, any art or arts, part
or parts. . . .&quot;)</p>
<p><i>You look like a robot, </i>Joe Malik says in a warped room in a skewered
time in San Francisco. / <i>mean, you move and walk like a robot.</i></p>
<p><i>Hold onto that, Mr. Wabbit, </i>says a bearded young man with a saturnine
smile. <i>Some trippers see themselves as robots. Others see the guide as a
robot. Hold that perspective. Is it a hallucination, or is a recognition of
something we usually black out?</i></p>
<p><i>Wait, </i>Joe says. <i>Part of you is like a robot. But part of you is
alive, like a growing thing, a tree or a plant.. ..</i></p>
<p>The young man continues to smile, his face drifting above his body toward the
mandala painted on the ceiling. <i>Well? </i>he asks. <i>Do you think that might
be a good poetic shorthand: that part of me is mechanical, like a robot, and
part of me is organic, like a rosebush? And what's the difference between the
mechanical and the organic? Isn't a rosebush a kind of machine used by the DNA
code to produce more rosebushes?</i></p>
<p><i>No, </i>Joe says. <i>Everything is mechanical, but people are different. A
cat has a grace that we've lost, or partly lost.</i></p>
<p><i>How do you think we've lost it?</i></p>
<p>And Joe sees the face of Father Volpe and hears the voice screaming about
submission. . . .</p>
<p>The SAC bases await the presidential order to take off for Fernando Poo,
Atlanta Hope addresses a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, protesting the gutless
appeasement of the comsymp administration in not threatening to bomb Moscow and
Peking the same time as Santa Isobel, the Premier of Russia rereads his speech
nervously as the TV cameras are set up in his office (&quot;and, in socialist
solidarity with the freedom-loving people of Fernando Poo&quot;), the Chairman
of the Chinese Communist party, having found the thought of Chairman Mao of
little avail, throws the <i>I</i> <i>Ching </i>sticks and looks dismally at
Hexagram 23, and 99 percent of the peoples of the world wait for their leaders
to tell them what to do; but in Santa Isobel itself, three locked doors across
the suite from the now-sleeping Concepcion, Fission Chips says angrily into his
shortwave,</p>
<p>&quot;Repeat none. Not one Russian or Chinese anywhere on the bloody island.
I don't care what Washington says. I'm telling you what I have seen. Now, about
the BUGGER heroin ring here—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sign off,&quot; the submarine tells him. &quot;HQ is not interested in
BUGGER or heroin right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damn and blast!&quot; Chips stares at the shortwave set That bloody
well tore it. He would just have to proceed on his own, and show those armchair
agents back in London, especially that smug W., how little they actually knew
about the real problem in Fernando Poo and the world.</p>
<p>Storming, he charged back to the bedroom. I'll just get dressed, he thought
furiously, including my smoke bombs and Luger and laser ray, and toddle over to
this Starry Wisdom church and see what I can nose out. But when he tore open the
bedroom door he stopped, momentarily stunned. Concepcion still lay in the bed
but she was no longer sleeping. Her throat was neatly cut and a curious dagger
with a flame design on it stuck into the pillow beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn, blast and thunder!&quot; cried 00005. &quot;Now that absolutely
does tear it. Every time I find a good piece of ass those fuckers from BUGGER
come along and shaft her!&quot;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the GO signal came from the White House, a fleet of SAC
bombers headed for Santa Isobel with hydrogen bombs, and Fission Chips, fully
dressed, toddled over to the Starry Wisdom church where he encountered, not
BUGGER, but something on an entirely different plane.</p>
