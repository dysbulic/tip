                                   American Pie
                                   By Don McClean


                                 A long, long time ago,
                                I can still remember how
                            that music used to make me smile.
                             And I knew if I had my chance
                          that I could make those people dance,
                         and maybe they'd be happy for a while.

                              But February made me shiver
                               with every paper I'd deliver.
                                Bad news on the doorstep
                              I couldn't take one more step.

                               I can't remember if I cried 
                          when I read about his widowed bride,
                          but something touched me deep inside
                                 the day the music died.

                             So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
                              drove my chevy to the levee
                                 but the levee was dry,
                              and them good old boys were 
                                drinkin' whiskey and rye
                            singin' this'll be the day that I die,
                               this'll be the day that I die.

                            Did you write the Book of Love,
                           and do you have faith in God above
                                if the Bible tells you so?
                              Do you believe in rock 'n roll?
                            Can music save your mortal soul?

                      And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
                         Well, I know that you're in love with him
                           'cause I saw you dancin' in the gym.
                             You both kicked off your shoes,
                            man, I dig those rhythm and blues.

                           I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
                         with a pink carnation and a pickup truck,
                              but I knew I was out of luck
                                 the day the music died.

                                    I started singin'
                               bye-bye, Miss American Pie
                              drove my chevy to the levee
                                 but the levee was dry,
                              and them good old boys were
                                drinkin' whiskey and rye
                            singin' this'll be the day that I die,
                               this'll be the day that I die.

                        Now for ten years we've been on our own
                          and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone.
                             But that's not how it used to be
                       when the jester sang for the King and Queen
                         in a coat he borrowed from James Dean.
                         And a voice that came from you and me.

                        Oh, and while the King was looking down
                             the jester stole his thorny crown.
                             The courtroom was adjourned,
                                no verdict was returned.
                         And while Lennon read a book of Marx,
                             the quartet practiced in the park.
                             And we sang dirges in the dark
                                 the day the music died.

                                    We were singing
                               bye-bye, Miss American Pie
                              drove my chevy to the levee
                                 but the levee was dry,
                              and them good old boys were 
                                drinkin' whiskey and rye
                            singin' this'll be the day that I die,
                               this'll be the day that I die.

                            Helter Skelter in a summer swelter
                         the Byrds flew off with a fallout shelter,
                             eight miles high and falling fast.
                              It landed foul out on the grass
                            the players tried for a forward pass
                         with the jester on the sidelines in a cast.

                        Now the half-time air was sweet perfume,
                        while the Sergeants played a marching tune
                                 we all got up to dance,
                            Oh, but we never got the chance,
                          'cause the players tried to take the field
                         But the marching band refused to yield.
                             Do you recall what was revealed
                                 the day the music died?

                                   We started singing
                               bye-bye, Miss American Pie
                              drove my chevy to the levee
                                 but the levee was dry,
                              and them good old boys were
                                drinkin' whiskey and rye
                            singin' this'll be the day that I die,
                               this'll be the day that I die.

                          Oh, and there we were all in one place
                                a generation lost in space,
                              with no time left to start again.
                        So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
                              Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
                           'cause fire is the Devil's only friend.

                          Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
                         my hands were clenched in fists of rage.
                                  No angel born in hell 
                              could break that Satan's spell,
                       and as the flames climbed high into the night
                                to light the sacrifical rite,
                             I saw Satan laughing with delight
                                 the day the music died.

                                     He was singing
                               bye-bye, Miss American Pie
                              drove my chevy to the levee
                                 but the levee was dry,
                              and them good old boys were
                                drinkin' whiskey and rye
                            singin' this'll be the day that I die,
                               this'll be the day that I die.

                              I met a girl who sang the blues
                          and I asked her for some happy news,
                           but she just smiled and turned away.
                             I went down to the sacred store
                         where I'd heard the music years before,
                      but the man there said the music woudn't play.
                         And in the streets the children screamed,
                         the lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.

                               But not a word was spoken,
                             the church bells all were broken.
                            And the three men I admire most,
                          The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost,
                          they caught the last train for the coast
                                 the day the music died.

                                 And they were singing
                               bye-bye, Miss American Pie
                              drove my chevy to the levee
                                 but the levee was dry,
                              and them good old boys were
                                drinkin' whiskey and rye
                            singin' this'll be the day that I die,
                               this'll be the day that I die.

                      They were singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
                              drove my chevy to the levee
                                 but the levee was dry,
                                them good old boys were
                                drinking whiskey and rye
                            singin' this'll be the day that I die.
