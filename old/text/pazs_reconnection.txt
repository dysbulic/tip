   "It is born at the very moment of our birth: as we are wrenched from
the Whole we fall into an alien land. This experience becomes a wound
that never heals. It is the unfathomable depth of every man; all our
ventures and exploits, all our acts and dreams, are bridges designed 
to overcome the separation and reunite us with the world and our
fellow-beings. Each man's life and the collective history of mankind 
can thus be seen as attempts to reconstruct the original situation. An
unfinished and endless cure for our divided condition."
                  (Octavio Paz...from Nobel Prize acceptance speech)
