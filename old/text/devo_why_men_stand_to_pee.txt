Why Men Stand To Pee

Seems God was just about done creating the universe, but he had two
extra things left in his bag of creations, so he decided to split them 
between Adam and Eve.

He told the couple that one of the things he had to give away was the
ability to stand up while urinating.  "It's a very handy thing," God 
told the couple, who he found under an apple tree. "I was wondering if 
either one of you wanted the ability."

Adam jumped up and blurted, "Oh, give that to me!  I'd love to.  Please, 
oh please, oh please, let me have that ability.  It'd be so great!  When 
I'm working in the garden or naming the animals I could just stand there 
and let it fly.  It'd be so cool, I could write my name in the sand.  Oh 
please, God, let it be me who you give that gift to, let me stand and 
pee, oh please!"

On and on he went like an excited little boy who had to pee. Eve just
smiled and told God that if Adam really wanted that so badly, that he
should have it.  It seemed to be the sort of thing that would make him
happy and  she really wouldn't mind if Adam were the one given this
ability.

And so Adam was given the ability to control the direction of his
misdirection while in a vertical position.  And so, he was happy and did 
celebrate by wetting down the bark on the tree nearest  him, laughing 
with delight all the while. And it was good.

"Fine," God said, looking back into his bag of leftover gifts, "What's
left here? Oh yes, Multiple orgasms."
