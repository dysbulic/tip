Thoughts On Love by Rumi
From: Fragments - Ecstasies
Translator-poet: Steve Phillips


  What is loving a woman?

a woman is God shining
through subtle veils

haughty spirit astride
the elegant mare
of her body

loving her
you love spirit
not a corpse

spirit is for lovers
the corpse is for necrophiles

heart's ease, laughter
meaningless, love...

Friend! you desire formless things
you are seeking the beloved
and don't even know
