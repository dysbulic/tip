A doctor and a lawyer in two cars collided on a country road.

The lawyer, seeing that the doctor was a little shaken up, helped him from
the car and offered him a drink from his hip flask.

The doctor accepted and handed the flask back to the lawyer, who closed it
and put it away.

 "Aren't you going to have a drink yourself?" asked the doctor.

"Sure, after the police leave," replied the attorney
