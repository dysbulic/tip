>    One day Bill decides to go there. He walks in with no shoes, jeans,
>    his T-shirt, and wild hair. The service has already started and so
>    Bill starts down the aisle looking for a seat. The church is
>    completely packed and he can't find a seat. By now people are looking
>    a bit uncomfortable, but no one says anything. Bill gets closer and
>    closer and closer to the pulpit and when he realizes there are no
>    seats, he just squats down right on the carpet. (Although perfectly
>    acceptable behavior at a college fellowship, trust me, this had never
>    happened in this church before!)
>    
>    By now the people are really uptight, and the tension in the air is
>    thick. About this time, the minister realizes that from way at the
>    back of the church, a deacon is slowly making his way toward Bill. Now
>    the deacon is in his eighties, has silver-gray hair, a three-piece
>    suit, and a pocket watch. A godly man, very elegant, very dignified,
>    very courtly. He walks with a cane and as he starts walking toward
>    this boy, everyone is saying to themselves: "You can't blame him for
>    what he's going to do. How can you expect a man of his age and of his
>    background to understand some college kid on the floor?"
>    
>    It takes a long time for the man to reach the boy. The church is
>    utterly silent except for the clicking of the man's cane. All eyes are
>    focused on him. You can't even hear anyone breathing. The people are
>    thinking, The minister can't even preach the sermon until the deacon
>    does what he has to do. And now they see this elderly man drop his
>    cane on the floor. With great difficulty he lowers himself and sits
>    down next to Bill and worships with him so he won't be alone. Everyone
>    chokes up with emotion.
>    
>    When the minister gains control he says, "What I'm about to preach,
>    you will never remember. What you have just seen, you will never
>    forget."
