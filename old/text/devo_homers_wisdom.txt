 THE WORLD ACCORDING TO HOMER SIMPSON
 
 The answer's to life's problems aren't found at the bottom of a 
 bottle, they're found on TV.
  ------
 Oh, yeah, what are you gonna do? Release the dogs?  Or the bees?  
 Or the dogs with bees in their mouth and when  they bark, they 
 shoot bees at you?
  ------
 Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not  whether you 
 win or lose... it's how drunk you get.
  ------
 Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, 
 never try.
  ------
 It's not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled  child, but 
 somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of  TV a day.
  ------
 Homer: Are you saying you're never going to eat any animal  again?  
 What about bacon?
 Lisa:  No.
 Homer: Ham?
 Lisa:  No!
 Homer: Pork chops?
 Lisa:  Dad, those all come from the same animal!
 Homer: Heh heh heh...ooh...yeah... right, Lisa. A wonderful... 
 magical animal.
  ------
 Marge: Do you want your son to be Chief Justice of the Supreme  
 Court, or a sleazy male stripper?
 Homer: Can't he be both, like the late Earl Warren?
 Marge: Earl Warren was never a stripper!
 Homer: Oh, now who's being naive?
  ------
 Homer: But every time I learn something new, it pushes out 
 something old!  
 Remember that time I took a home wine-making course and forgot how 
 to drive?
 Marge: That's because you were drunk!
 Homer: And how!
  ------
 Oh, Lisa, you and your stories: Bart's a vampire, beer kills brain 
 cells.  Now let's go back to that...building...thingie... where our 
 beds and TV...is.
  ------
 Operator! Give me the number for 911!
 ------
 Lenny: Hey, Homer? What do I tell the boss?
 Homer: Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman 
 I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!
  ------
 Big brother representative: Now, Mr. Simpson, may I ask why  you're 
 here?
 Homer's brain: Don't say revenge.  Don't say revenge.
 Homer: Ummm... revenge?
 Homer's brain: Okay, that's it.  I'm outta here.  (step step step 
 step step...slam)
  ------
 Homer: Okay, brain.  You don't like me, and I don't like you,  but 
 let's get through this thing and then I can continue killing you 
 with beer.
 Homer's Brain: It's a deal!
  ------
 Homer: But Marge! I was a political prisoner!
 Marge: How were you a political prisoner?
 Homer: I kicked a giant mouse in the butt!  Do I have to draw you a 
 picture?
  ------
 Homer: Bart, a woman is like a beer.  They look good, they smell 
 good, and you'd step over your own mother just to get one! (chugs 
 beer)
  ------
 Old man: Take this doll, but beware; it carries a terrible curse.
 Homer: Ooo, that's bad.
 Old man: But it comes with a free serving of frozen yogurt!
 Homer: That's good!
 Old man: The frozen yogurt is also cursed.
 Homer: That's bad.
 Old man: But it comes with your choice of toppings!
 Homer: That's good!
 Old man: The toppings contain potassium benzoate...
 Homer:
 Old man: That's bad.
 Homer: Can I go now?
  ------
 Getting out of jury duty is easy.  The trick is to say  you're 
 prejudiced against all races.
  ------
 Homer's brain: Use reverse psychology.
 Homer: Oh, that sounds too complicated.
 Homer's brain: Okay, don't use reverse psychology.
 Homer: Okay, I will!
  ------
 Homer: When I first heard that Marge was joining the police  
 academy, I thought it would be fun and zany, like that movie -- 
 Spaceballs.  But instead it was dark and  disturbing.  Like that 
 movie -- Police Academy.
  ------
 Marge: Homer, did you call the audience "Chicken"?
 Homer: No! I swear on this bible!
 Marge: That's not a bible. That's a book of carpet samples.
 Homer: Mmmm... fuzzy.
  ------
 Lisa: Dad, we did something very bad!
 Homer: Did you wreck the car?
 Bart: No.
 Homer: Did you raise the dead?
 Lisa: Yes.
 Homer: But the car's okay?
 Bart & Lisa: Uh-huh.
 Homer: All right then.
  ------
 Mmmmm... reprocessed pig fat...
  ------
 (praying): Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me.  As  an 
 offering, I present these milk and cookies.  If you wish me to eat 
 them instead, please give me no sign  whatsoever... thy will be 
 done (munch munch munch).
  ------
 Homer: (On George Bush) I didn't vote for him!
 Marge: You didn't vote for anybody.
 Homer: I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle.  Then 
 I became deeply cynical.
  ------
 What's the point of going out?  We're just going to  wind up back 
 here anyway.
