there are three major areas that are looked at in this scale.  each
question is stressing some of these aspects.  but each aspect is
intercorrelated so there aren't real strict boundaries.  the three
major aspects of group cohesion are interpersonal attraction (how much
you like the people in your group), group pride, and task commitment
(individual commitment to completing the group's goal).  despite their
intercorrelation, studies show that task commitment ultimately is the
predictor of group performance (how well they complete their task).

in task oriented groups (groups that were built with the primary
purpose of completing a project) the average score was 6.15.  the
average for social groups was 6.27.  the average for therapy and
support groups was 5.48.  the standard deviation for all of these is
roughly 1.5.
