Here's something fun to do, but you must follow the directions closely
and not cheat, okay?

***Make a wish before you start the quiz***

Warning! Do take the quiz as you read, there are only four questions,
and if you scan all the way to the end before finishing you won't get
the honest results.

Don't cheat. Scroll slowly and do each exercise. Don't look ahead.

Get pencil and paper and write it down. You will need it at the end. 
This is an honest quiz, that will tell you about your true self.

Enjoy!
