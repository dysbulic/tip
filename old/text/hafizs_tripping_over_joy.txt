	Tripping Over Joy

What is the difference
between your experience of Existence 
and that of a saint?

Well, the saint knows
that a spiritual path
is a sublime chess game with G-O-D.

And that the Beloved 
has just made such a Fantastic Move
that the saint is continually
tripping over Joy
and bursting out in Laughter
and saying, "I Surrender!"

Whereas, my dear,
I am afraid you still think
You have a thousand serious moves to make.
