To say you have no pain is like saying, "I am God."
To say "I" at the wrong time is a curse.
To say "I" at the right time is a gift of God.
For Hallaj it was timely; for Pharaoh a lie.
Behead the rooster that crows too early.

Anke u bi dard bashad rahzanast
zanke bi dardi "ana al-Haqq" goftanast
An "ana" bi vaqt goftan la`nat ast
an "ana" dar vaqt goftan rahmat ast
An "ana" Mansur rahmat shod yaqin
an "ana" Fer`awn la`nat shod be-bin
La jaram har morgh bi hangam-ra
sar boridan vajebast e`lam-ra

(Masnavi, II:2521-2524)
