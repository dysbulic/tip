                      A Blessing for Your Work
 
May the light of your soul bless the work you do with the
	love and warmth of your heart.
May you see in what you do the beauty of your own soul.
May the sacredness of your work bring healing, light, and 
	renewal to those who work with you and to those who see
	and receive your work.
May it release within you wellsprings of refreshment,
	inspiration, and excitement.
May you be present in what you do.
May you never become lost.
May your work never become a burden.
May the dawn find you awake and alert, approaching your
	new day with dreams, possibilities, and promises.
And, may you go into night blessed, sheltered, and protected.

				John O'Donohue,
