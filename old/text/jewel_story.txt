THE PRECIOUS JEWEL

All wisdom, it is has been reported, is contained in the 
various levels of interpretation of this ancient traditional tale:

In a remote realm of perfection, there was a just monarch who
had a wife and a wonderful son and daughter. They all lived
together in happiness.

One day the father called his two children before him and said:
"The time has come, as it does for all. You are to go down, an
infinite distance, to another land; there you shall seek and
find and bring back a precious Jewel."

The travellers were conducted in disguise to a strange land,
whose inhabitants almost all lived a dark existence. Such was
the effect of this place that the two lost touch with each
other, wandering as if asleep.

From time to time they saw phantoms, counterparts of their
country and of the Jewel, but such was their condition that
these things only increased the depth of their reveries, which
they now began to take as reality.

When news of his children's plight reached the king, he sent
word by a trusted servant, a wise man:

"Remember your mission, awaken from your dream, and remain
together."

With this message they roused themselves, and with the help of
their rescuing guide they dared the monstrous perils which
surrounded the Jewel. And by the Jewel's magic aid returned to
their realm of light, there to remain in increased happiness
for evermore.
