Today upon a bus, I saw a lovely maid with golden hair:
I envied her - she seemed so happy and wished I were as fair.
When suddenly she rose to leave, I saw her hobble down the aisle;
She had one foot and wore a crutch, but as she passed a smile.
Oh, God, forgive me when I whine;
I have two feet - the world is mine!

And then I stopped to buy some sweets.
The lad who sold them had such charm;
I talked with him - he said to me;
"It's nice to talk with folks like you.
You see,"he said," I'm blind".
Oh, God, forgive me when I whine;
I have two eyes - the world is mine.

Then walking down the street, I saw a child with eyes of blue.
He stood and watched the others play; It seemed he knew not what to do,
I stopped for a moment, then I said: "WHY don't you join the others, dear?"
He looked ahead without a word, and then I knew he could not hear.
Oh, God, forgive me when I whine.

I have two ears - the world is mine!
With feet to take me where I would go,
With eyes to see the sunset's glow,
With ears to hear what I know,
Oh, God forgive me when I whine;
I'm blessed, indeed! The world is mine.
