    <h1>1 Corinthians 13 (English - <acronym title="New Interational Version">NIV</acronym>)</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>If I speak in the tongues <sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup> of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.</li>
      <li>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</li>
      <li>If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, <sup>[<a href="#footnote2">2</a>]</sup> but have not love, I gain nothing.</li>
      <li>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.</li>
      <li>It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.</li>
      <li>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.</li>
      <li>It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</li>
      <li>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</li>
      <li>For we know in part and we prophesy in part,</li>
      <li>but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.</li>
      <li>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.</li>
      <li>Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</li>
      <li>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</li>
    </ol>
