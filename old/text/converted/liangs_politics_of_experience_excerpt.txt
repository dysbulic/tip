From R.D. Liang's _The_Politics_of_Experience_ (1967) pages 4-5.

"I cannot experience your experience. You cannot experience my
experience.

"I cannot avoid trying to understand your experience, because although
I do not experience your experience, which is invisible to me (and
nontestable, nontouchable, nonsmellable, and inaudible), yet I
experience you as experiencing.

"I do not experience your experience. But I experience you as
experiencing. I experience myself as experienced by you. And I
experience you as experiencing yourself as experience by me. And so
on.

"The study of the experience of others is based upon inferences I
make, from my experience of you experiencing me, about how are
experiencing me experiencing you experiencing me..."
