1.If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I
am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2.If I have the gift
of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I
have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 
3.If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the
flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.  4.Love is patient, love is
kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  5.It is
not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps
no record of wrongs.  6.Love does not delight in evil but rejoices
with the truth.  7.It always protects, always trusts, always hopes,
always perseveres.  8.Love never fails. But where there are
prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be
stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.  9.For we know
in part and we prophesy in part,  10.but when perfection comes, the
imperfect disappears.  11.When I was a child, I talked like a child, I
thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I
put childish ways behind me.  12.Now we see but a poor reflection as
in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then
I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.  13.And now these three
remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
