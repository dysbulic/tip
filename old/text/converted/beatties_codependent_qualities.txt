The preceding checklist is long but not all-inclusive. Like other
people, codependents do, feel, and think many things. There are not a
certain number of traits that guarantees whether a person is or isn't
codependent. Each person is different; each person has his or her way
of doing things. I'm just trying to paint a picture. The
interpretation, or decision, is up to you. What's most important is
that you first identify behaviors or areas that cause you problems,
and then decide what you want to do.
