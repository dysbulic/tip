               SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF SELF-ACTUALIZING PEOPLE
                           Summarized from Maslow

1.  Intrinsic rather than extrinsic learning. They are more concerned
with learning to be the best human being possible than with learning
that does not promote their fulfillment as human beings.

2.  Being values rather than becoming values. They are concerned with
ultimate values and are devoted to working at something very precious
to them, as if it were ordained by God or by fate. The joy-work
dichotomy disappears. Their work is their joy.

3.  Transcendent needs. Motivated to experience gratifications beyond
those necessary for ordinary living. They pursue beauty, truth, etc.

4.  Experiencing fully, vividly, selflessly, with full concentration
and total absorption. Without self consciousness. Experiencing with
continued freshness of appreciation.

5.  Growth choices rather than regressive or defensive choices for
behavior.

6.  Emergence of the inner self. Responsive to inner voice rather
than to voice of those calling for conforming to molds.

7.  Honesty rather than playing games in interpersonal relations.

8.  Courage to be one's self, even if it means being unpopular.

9.  Working to do well what one needs (wants) to do.

10.  Peak experiences or transcendent moments. Moments of ecstasy
when one is "surprised by joy."

11.  Identification of one's own defenses and having the courage to
give them up for more healthful ways of experiencing.

12.  Accurate perception of reality and comfortable relations with it.

13.  Spontaneity, natural, not scheming but not impulsive to
stupidity.
