These are the 10 winners of the 2001 Bulwar Lytton contest (run by
the English Department of San Jose State University), in which one
writes only the first line of a bad novel.

10) As a scientist, Throckmorton knew that if he were ever to break
     wind in the echo chamber he would never hear the end of it.

9) Just beyond the Narrows the river widens.

8) With a curvaceous figure that Venus would have envied, a tanned, 
    unblemished oval face framed with lustrous thick brown hair, deep
    azure-blue eyes fringed with long black lashes, perfect teeth
    that vied for competition, and a small straight nose, Marilee had
    a beauty that defied description.

7) Andre, a simple peasant, had only one thing on his mind as he crept
    along the east wall: "Andre creep... Andre creep... Andre creep."

6) Stanislaus Smedley, a man always on the cutting edge of narcissism,
    was about to give his body and soul to a back-alley sex-change
    surgeon to become the woman he loved.

5) Although Sarah had an abnormal fear of mice, it did not keep her
    from eking out a living at a local pet store.

4) Stanley looked quite bored and somewhat detached, but then penguins
    often do.

3) Like an overripe beefsteak tomato rimmed with cottage cheese, the
    corpulent remains of Santa Claus lay dead on the hotel floor.

2) Mike Hardware was the kind of private eye who didn't know the
    meaning of the word "fear," a man who could laugh in the face of
    danger and spit in the eye of death -- in short, a moron with
    suicidal tendencies.

AND THE WINNER IS...

1) The sun oozed over the horizon, shoved aside darkness, crept along
    the greensward, and, with sickly fingers, pushed through the
    castle window, revealing the pillaged princess, hand at throat,
    crown asunder, gaping in frenzied horror at the sated, sodden
    amphibian lying beside her, disbelieving the magnitude of the
    frog's deception, screaming madly, "You lied!"
