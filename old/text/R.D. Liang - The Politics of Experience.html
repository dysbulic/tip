    <h2>by R.D. Liang</h2>
    <h2>pages 4-5</h2>

    <p>"I cannot experience your experience. You cannot experience my experience.</p>

    <p>"I cannot avoid trying to understand your experience, because although I do not experience your experience, which is invisible to me (and nontestable, nontouchable, nonsmellable, and inaudible), yet I experience you as experiencing.</p>

    <p>"I do not experience your experience. But I experience you as experiencing. I experience myself as experienced by you. And I experience you as experiencing yourself as experience by me. And so on.</p>

    <p>"The study of the experience of others is based upon inferences I make, from my experience of you experiencing me, about how are experiencing me experiencing you experiencing me..."</p>
