These 
spiritual windowshoppers,
   who idly ask, How much is that?
Oh, I'm just looking.

They handle a hundred items
and put them down
shadows with no capital.

What is spent is love
and two eyes wet
with weeping.  But these walk
into a shop, and their whole lives 
pass suddenly in that moment,
in that shop.

Where did you go? "Nowhere."
What did you have to eat? "Nothing 
much."

Even if you don't know
what you want, buy something,
to be part
of the general exchange.

Start a huge, foolish, project, 
like Noah.

It makes absolutely no
difference what people
think of you.

          _The Illuminated Rumi_ translated by Coleman Barks
