	 An Autobiography in Five Short Chapters

1.  I walk down the street.
    There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
	 I fall in.
	 I am lost. 
			I am helpless.
			It isn't my fault.
	 It takes me forever to find a way out.

2.  I walk down the same street.
    There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
	 I pretend I don't see it.
	 I fall in, again.
			I can't believe I am in this same place.
			But it isn't my fault.
			I get out a little more quickly.

3.  I walk down the same street.
    There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
	 I _see_ it is there.
	 I still fall in.
			It's a habit.  But...
			My eyes are open.
			I know where I am.
			It _is_ my fault.
			I get out quickly.

4.  I walk down the same street.
    There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
	 I walk around it.

5.  I walk down another street.
