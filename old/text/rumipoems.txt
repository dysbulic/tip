THE CLEAR BEAD

The clear bead at the center changes everything.
There are no edges to my loving now.

I've heard it said there's a window that opens
from one mind to another.

but if there's no wall, there's no need
for fitting the window, or the latch.



THERE'S NOTHING AHEAD

Lovers think they're looking for each other,
but there's only one search: Wandering
this world is wandering that, both inside one
transparent sky. In here
there is no dogma and no heresy.

The miracle of Jesus is himself, not what he said or did
about the future. Forget the future.
I'd worship someone who could do that!

On the way you may want to look back, or not,
but if you can say "There's nothing ahead,"
there will be nothing there.

Stretch your arms and take hold of the cloth of your clothes
with both hands. The cure for pain is in the pain.
Good and bad are mixed. If you don't have both, 
you don't belong with us.

When one of us gets lost, is not here, he must be inside us.
There's no place like that anywhere in the world.


THE GUEST HOUSE

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes 
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows, 
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out 
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent 
as a guide from beyond.



ALL OUR LIVES

All our lives we've looked
into each other's faces.
That was the case today too.

How do we keep our love-secret?
We speak from brow to brow
and hear with our eyes.



SAY YES QUICKLY
 
Forget your life. Say "God is great." Get up.
You think you know what time it is. It's time to pray.
You've carved so many little figurines, too many.
Don't knock on any random door like a beggar.
Reach your long hand out to another door, beyond where
you go on the street, the street
where everyone says, "How are you?"
and no one says "How aren't you?"
 
Tomorrow you'll see what you've broken and torn tonight,
thrashing in the dark. Inside you
there's an artist you don't know about.
He's not interested in how things look different in moonlight.
 
If you are here unfaithfully with us,
you're causing terrible damage.
If you've opened your loving to God's love,
you're helping people you don't know
and have never seen.
 
Is what I say true? Say yes quickly,
if you know, if you've known it
from before the beginning of the universe.



LET'S GO HOME

Late and starting to rain, it's time to go home.
We've wandered long enough in empty buildings.
I know it's tempting to stay and meet those new people.
I know it's even more sensible
to spend the night here with them,
but I want to be home.

We've seen enough beautiful places with signs on them
saying, "This is God's house."
That's seeing the grain like the ants do,
without the work of harvesting.
Let's leave grazing to cows and go
where we know what everyone really intends,
where we can walk around without clothes on.

                   Love is reckless; not reason.
                      Reason seeks a profit.
                       Love comes on strong,
                   consuming herself, unabashed.
                  Yet, in the midst of suffereing,
                  Love proceeds like a millstone,
                 hard-surfaced and straightforward.
                   Having died to self-interest,
            she risks everything and asks for nothing.

             Love gambles away every gift God bestows.
                Without cause God gave us Being;
                without cause, give it back again.
           Gambling yourself away is beyond religion.
                 Religion seeks grace and favor,
                 but those who gamble these away
                      are God's favorites,
               for they neither put God to the test
              nor knock on the door of gain and loss.
