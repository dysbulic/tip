I know the sound of the ecstatic flute,
but I don't know whose flute it is.

A lamp burns and has neither wick nor oill

A lily pad blossoms and is not attached to the bottom!

When one flower opens, ordinarily dozens open.

The moon bird's head is filled with nothing but thoughts of the moon,
and when the next rain will come is all that the rain bird thinks of.

Who is it we spend our whole life loving?
