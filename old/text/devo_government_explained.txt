This little boy goes to his Dad and asks, "What is politics?" Dad
says, "Well, son let me try to explain it to you this way... I'm the
breadwinner of the family, so let's call me 'Capitalism'. Your Mom,
she's the administrator of the household, so we'll call her the
Government. We're here to take care of YOUR needs, so we'll call you
'The People'. The nanny, well, she works hard all day for very little
money, so we'll consider her 'The Working Class'. And your baby
brother... we'll call him 'The Future'. Now, think about that and see
if it makes sense."

So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what his Dad has
said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets
up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his
diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his
mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's
room. Finding the door locked, he peeks into the keyhole and sees his
father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed.

The next morning, the little boy says to his father, "Dad, I think I
understand the concept of politics now." The father says, "Good, son,
tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about". The
little boy replies, "Well, While Capitalism is screwing the Working
Class, the Government is sound asleep, The People are being ignored,
and the Future is in Deep Shit."
