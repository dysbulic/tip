<strong><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hello and welcome. Just for the record, I am neither a "youth"
or actually in the Holston Confrence. I am a 17 year old freshman at
Tennessee Tech in Cookeville, TN. I am now technically a semi-adult
member of the Cumberland Confrence, but the people back in the Holston
Youth are so cool, that I don't want to loose touch with them. To that
end I have made a small home page in their honor. It's not much yet,
but I hope to build on it until I like it. Enjoy, and I would love to
get any comments or suggestions that you might have on how to make
this a better page. Thanks for stopping by.

<A NAME="Adam">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Adam is from Cleveland, TN. <strike>He has not sent me a bio
yet, but</strike> I know that he draws some cool cartoons. I remember reading
<cite>The Adventures of Househead</cite> (I'm pretty sure that's right)
while on Salt and Light Tour. Here is what Adam has to say about
himself:<i>(I changed it to the first person)</i>
<br><br>
<font size=+2>A</font>dam <font size=+2>B</font>eeken-
I am a junior from Cleveland, Tennessee. I am
17 years old and attend Cleveland High School (State champs 3 years in
a row.) I enjoy Music (band and choir), Theatre, and going to Church
activities. I attend Wesley Memotial UMC. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends: 
<a href="#Matt">Matt Viser</A>, <a href="#Chalmer">Chalmer Harper</a>, David Thaggard, 
Ashley Wilson, and Sam Rogers. I am looking
for a good college to attend and I intend to major in Music Education.
I love all of my Salt and Light friends and I can't wait to see them all at the next
oppurtunity. Here is my picture <tt>0-l&lt;</tt>. <br>Always remember 
<strong><font size=+1>"Everyone is someone and Jesus Christ is Lord"</strong></font>

drop Adam a note</a> and tell him that you liked his bio. 
<HR width="90%" size=3>
<A NAME="Matt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Matt is a tenor in the Salt and Light Choir. I know that he is
from Cleveland, and that he and <a href="#Adam">Adam</a> have sung together in a show
choir. Matt has been having some trouble with his knee, and he
recently (11/6/96). His birthday is Nov. 11, so you can <A HREF="mailto:Viser3@aol.com?subject=Happy Birthday!"
onMouseOver="window.status='A Matt with mail is a happy Matt'; return true"

send Matt some e-mail</A> and cheer him up or wish him happy birthday.

<A NAME="Louis">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Louis is from Morristown. He likes exploring and baseball amoung other
things. When I went to Morristown with the Tech Chorale, I got to stay
at Louis' house for a night. He is a pool shark, and I found out that
he likes Clint Esatwood movies. He also likes the Beatles, and the
doorknobs to his room are baseballs (I thought that was cool.) Louis
is now a Senior at Morristown West High School, and he is an Eagle
Scout (wow.) Why don't you

<A NAME="Jane">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jane is right here in Cookeville with me. She is a freshman Music
Therapy major, and a really nice person. We are both in the Tech
Concert Choir, and I know that Jane is working on playing the guitar.
The music program here at Tech is supposed to be very good, and from
how I have seen the Music Majors working, I wouldn't doubt it. They
will tech you how to read music, and do ear training where you learn
relative pitch. Jane told me that this is challenging.
For those of you who don't know, music therapy <i>(as I understand
it)</i> is like psycotherapy, but the threapist uses music instead.
Jane is originally from Knoxville, TN, and she gives me rides when I
go to see people at UTK. As always, <A
HREF="mailto:JAD6833@tntech.edu?subject=Music Therapy is FUN!!!"
onMouseOver="window.status='Jane Jane is a hard worker'; return true">
harass Jane for me</A> and get her to send me some first hand
information.

Hello, 'tis me again. As I said I am a 17 year old
freshman at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, TN.
Right now I have little idea what major I will go into, and I don't
plan to decide for a little while now. I have a <A

schedule</a> right now. I like it here at TTU right now. I am active
in the Honors Program, as well as the Wesley Foundation, and First UMC
in Cookeville. I am actually an "adult" now. It is really weird not
being a youth member anymore. It's pretty much the same, except that
now I a leader...&lt;evil laugh&gt;...just kidding.
