				<body>Ok, if this is going to work, you are going to have to NOT post everything in French. I gather what this post is about but you have to understand my French is limited to oui, au revoir, bon jour, coq au vin, and Voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir.

So unless you are greeting me, bidding me adieu, asking me to sleep with you or inquiring about a fine chicken dish I am lost.</body>

				<body>D&apos;accord, mais il faut que je pratique à le mois un peu. Je suis ici depuis une année et je ne peux pas encore parler le français assez bien d&apos;exprimer les choses plus complexe que si je veux manger ou si je suis fatigue. À mon avis il y aura un vrai dommage si je n&apos;apprend pas quelque chose pendant que je suis en Afrique.

Franchement, given my level in French, you can assume that pretty much anything I know how to say in French is likely of little enough signifigance that you don&apos;t lose anything at all by not being able to read it.</body>

			<subject>Sets</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;In typical depression avoidance I spent the last couple days pouring my energies into writing computer programs. The project du jour was a trainer to work on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.setgame.com&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt; playing. One of the Stagiers had a copy when I was in Kaédi and I played with he and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mollytania.diaryland.com&quot;&gt;Molly&lt;/a&gt;, and she kicked the crap out of both of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking about the sets and how the math works and so wrote the program. It isn&apos;t very fancy, but good enough to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use it you&apos;ve got to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/&quot;&gt;SVG plugin&lt;/a&gt;. (The Adobe plugin only works in Internet Explorer unless you download the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/betaframed.html&quot;&gt;Alpha Preview&lt;/a&gt; or use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xml.apache.org/batik/&quot;&gt;standalone viewer&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/set_trainer/set.svg&quot;&gt;http://odin.himinbi.org/set_trainer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, there should be an embedded &amp;lt;object&amp;gt; tag. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com&quot;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt; seems to be eating it though. I suppose to protect against ActiveX browser exploits.&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>When in the hell am I (or the world at large for that matter) going to get to see actual proof that you went to France? Tell me there are pictures? There are pictures, right? I can&apos;t imagine your mom going and not documenting every minute of the vacation.

Watch out for that depression monster. It&apos;s nasty and a sneaky little bastard too.

You know that no matter how much code you write- it will be there to embrace you with its dark powers when you return. Better to deal with it than live with it and have it affect every part of your life.</body>

				<body>Cool. Yes, your hair always did have a mind of its own. There are no barbers in Africa? Why don&apos;t you just cornrow it and get it over with? Maybe I will nudge Brett about the pictures. &apos;Course, I think he is still in Bristol right now. I saw their (Brett, Wayne &amp; Amber) new house the other day when Johnny was in town- it&apos;s nice. Much nicer than the last one.</body>

				<body>Pretty much my only reasons to get it cut are women and functionality. Right now it isn&apos;t bothering me functionally and there are no especially interesting women, so I let it go.

Actually I poll sometimes and I still get about 50% who say it isn&apos;t a bad look for me so long as I&apos;m not grubby. As much as anything I&apos;m worried about my near complete loss of all non-functional musculature.</body>

&lt;p&gt;This one of me came out pretty good I think, though my hair in general was at that point where it was long enough to curl, but not long enough to start to weight itself down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;height: 450px; width: 600px; background: url(&apos;http://wheresbob.smugmug.com/photos/5107670-M.jpg&apos;); border: groove; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett and mom both had digital cameras and took several hundred pictures. Brett is supposed to get them up on the web, so that means it may well get done when I get back to the States.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;We had some girls in town from Senegal and I got to show them around. It has left me feeling a bit sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The easiest and quickest way to induce depression and alienation in an infant or child is not to touch it, hold it, or carry it on your body. Extensive scientific research has documented that these forms of sensory stimulation (touch, smell, and movement) during the formative periods of brain development are absolutely essential for normal growth and the development of the brain and behavior. Deprivation of these forms of sensory stimulation, called &quot;Somato-Sensory Affectional Deprivation&quot; (S-SAD), results in abnormal development and function of the brain... that accounts for the abnormal emotional and social behaviors that are
a consequence of S-SAD: depression/alienation, anxiety/boredom, hostility/rage, and violence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;--&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atlc.org/WhoWeAre/BOD.php&quot;&gt;James W. Prescott&lt;/a&gt;, PhD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family wasn&apos;t very touchy when I was a kid and though I enjoy it I am very clumsy with it. One of the sorts of people I really admire are those who are physically warm. It is something that I see pretty commonly with girls, but guys can do it too. I was sitting in the computer lab today and Dana walked up behind me to talk with me and rested his hands on my shoulders; completely casual, completely natural, completely comfortable. There is no way in hell I could ever pull that off with all but my closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fears come in part from knowing that some of the most socially undesirable people I know are judged such in part such because of their inability to discern the appropriateness of their touching. (Based from the things said about them behind their backs.) This is the class of &quot;creepy&quot; guys who would give girls unwanted massages or just loom. So far as touching guys I have pretty much no clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the intersex bit depends primarily on the attractiveness (physical and otherwise) of the other party. I&apos;m pretty sure that &lt;a href=&quot;http://celebritymalemodels.com/celebs/brad_pitt/gallery.php&quot;&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/a&gt; could put his hands on most anyone even if he wasn&apos;t famous (barring a severe social dysfunction). For this reason I&apos;ve been contemplating my attractiveness in &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminati.stderr.org/pipermail/jsfromtherim/2004-July/000301.html&quot;&gt;other circles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m pretty much a complete dating novice. I didn&apos;t start until I got to college and then I only had a few exclusive relationships (~3 months) with people I knew. Then hooking up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://livejournal.com/~innerdiva/&quot;&gt;Steph&lt;/a&gt; and dating for four and a half years means that I&apos;ve never asked a girl for her phone number (with romantic intentions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was liking one of the Senegalese girls, but really don&apos;t know how to tell if she was interested in me at all. I&apos;m pretty sure she liked talking to me. I recently had an experience with a girl that I really like spending time with, but that essential &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allwords.com/query.php?Keyword=spark&amp;Language=ENG&amp;FRA=1&quot;&gt;étincelle&lt;/a&gt; isn&apos;t there. How to know when someone is feeling that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m hoping that this issue will go something like crying. At one point I really didn&apos;t know how to deal with crying. When Danyel would start crying (especially as a result of our fighting) I&apos;d just sort of sit in an uncomfortable silence watching her. I&apos;m perhaps not masterful now, but I do better than average so far as emotional support. The change came from a simple combination of exposure to emotionality and getting more in touch with myself emotionally. Hopefully touch and social stuff will pass that was as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not here, though. I don&apos;t touch much of anyone here. I have been getting comfortable with that. I&apos;m betting there is some part of my brain atrophying because of it, but my choices are pretty limited. The idea of having casual sex is something that I don&apos;t know how to do and even if I did, other than the allure of something untried, it doesn&apos;t sound all that fun. It isn&apos;t the sex that I miss anywhere near as much as the connecting with another person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s not really anyone here that really captures my interest. There are a couple of possible Mrs. Right-Nows, but even if I did try to date here I would be seeing the person for a week every three months. (People en brusse get one week a quarter in the capitol.) It is just icky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always hesitant to propagate gender stereotypes, but something that I realized hanging out with these girls is just how much being &quot;one of the guys&quot; for the last year has left me craving emotional depth in my relationships. I really like these guys, but so far as feeling deeply emotionally stimulated; I&apos;m not generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two new ICT trainees; a boy and a girl. One is coming here and one is getting sent out en brusse. I went down to Kaédi and talked to both of them. I liked hanging out with both of them. While we were there though I learned that the guy was coming to Nouakchott and I tried (along with the person in the other site) to convince my APCD to change his mind. All of my arguments are definitely true, but I&apos;d be lying to say that I didn&apos;t want her here for my own benefit as much as anything. I&apos;ve been muddling through a depression for about a month now and I really don&apos;t see the guy that we are getting changing the dynamic such as to make it more satisfying emotionally...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, it is just something I need to work on. Both trying to be truer with the guys and watching out for other places to get support.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>&quot;I&apos;ve been muddling through a depression for about a month now and I really don&apos;t see the guy that we are getting changing the dynamic such as to make it more satisfying emotionally...&quot;

Just remember, no girl is going to make you happy. The older I get the more I see that you have to be comfortable in your own skin- able to be happy alone, happy quiet- before you can be happy with someone else. Get well first, and yes hang out with some well, with some nicer people. But don&apos;t expect the depression you are experiencing to be cured by a member of the opposite sex. She will mask the problem but it won&apos;t go away. If you are depressed, as I think you have been for a long time (my $.02), another person cannot cure this.

Have you liked being &quot;one of the guys&quot; for the last year? I know it has taught you things about yourself, about women and life in general. However, these guys, are not like the guys you previously encountered, i.e., willing to explore their feelings, be vulnerable, etc. Have these guys altered your previous perceptions of gender?

Not so much looking for a debate- just curious.

				<body>&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; border: thin solid gray; background-color: rgb(255, 204, 255); padding: .1em;&quot;&gt;Just remember, no girl is going to make you happy. The older I get the more I see that you have to be comfortable in your own skin- able to be happy alone, happy quiet- before you can be happy with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure I agree with you entirely on this. I&apos;m definitely on the same page so far as one is not going find their happiness in someone else. It is sort of like heading to Tibet to find peace. The peace, if it arrives, will come from the individual. That said, the decision to search and the spending time with wise people are often very productive in the search for peace. So, it is true that you won&apos;t find peace in Tibet, but at the same time if you are looking for peace Tibet might not be a bad idea. (Perhaps not the best, but not bad.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that looking for a romantic relationship to &quot;fix&quot; or &quot;complete&quot; you is setting yourself up for failure. I&apos;m not talking about looking for romance though. I&apos;m just talking about missing a certain depth in my friendships. To apply the idea of happiness coming from within to the need for community seems to say that all loneliness is neurotic. I think missing emotional intimacy, given my past of detachment, speaks of me having gained some depth, if anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; border: thin solid gray; background-color: rgb(255, 204, 255); padding: .1em;&quot;&gt;Get well first, and yes hang out with some well, with some nicer people. But don&apos;t expect the depression you are experiencing to be cured by a member of the opposite sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having hung out with me for four years did you know me to ever expect anyone else to understand me, let alone heal me? That takes a level of trust I&apos;ve not yet accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not like I&apos;m a recluse spending my days shunning all human contact and hiding in my house all day filling notebooks with my thousand page manifesto on the bleakness of existence. I do actually have a wide variety of friends who I like and who like me in return. I&apos;m thought a bit odd, but I&apos;m cool with that. I&apos;m not talking about a severe mental dysfunction here, just being lonely for some of the depth that I had with my friends back in the States.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

				<body>&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; border: thin solid gray; background-color: rgb(255, 204, 255); padding: .1em;&quot;&gt;Have you liked being &quot;one of the guys&quot; for the last year?

However, these guys, are not like the guys you previously encountered, i.e., willing to explore their feelings, be vulnerable, etc. Have these guys altered your previous perceptions of gender?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends here are generally &quot;cooler&quot; than the people I hung out with back home. Meaning, more like typical American college kids than the very interesting, but somewhat dorky, Honors crowd I was with back home. They&apos;ve definitely deepened my understanding of myself. I&apos;m getting better at the whole hanging out in a bar chatting and drinking a beer matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far as my ideas on gender they&apos;ve largely been strengthened. Before I was pretty insecure about my emotionality because I was surrounded by so many solidly grounded people. Hanging out with people with more traditional backgrounds I generally rank higher. I&apos;ve also just been living with these questions for a while longer and I&apos;ve started integrating some of the characteristics I was working on. A big part of the reason I didn&apos;t express my emotionality was being afraid of how it would make me look and as I get more comfortable with my social position I&apos;m more comfortable expressing those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if nothing else I&apos;m my own argument now. My arguments were always personal anyhow. The question wasn&apos;t &quot;how do genertics affect gender?&quot; it was &quot;how do my genetics determine what I can be?&quot; I feel much more comfortable that the world of emotional intimacy is as open to me as a guy as it is to any girl. The societal training definitely doesn&apos;t set guys up to take advantage of it, but so far as ability I&apos;ve not seen anything to suggest it isn&apos;t there.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

			<event>A while back we took pictures of everyone so that we could put together a book for the new trainees and help them put faces to names. I recently integrated those pictures into the my lists of volunteers.

Creative group that we have here a couple of our guys took all the pictures (about seventy of them) and put them all on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotornot.com/&quot;&gt;Hot or Not&lt;/a&gt;. It is not something I would have done myself, but it is kinda interesting and apropos to the discussion of beauty.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=O8AZNRE&amp;key=LBM&quot;&gt;My entry&lt;/a&gt; has a 7 now. Apparently that puts me at 67% which feels alright to me. Maybe with some nice abs I could bump myself into the top quartile. Someone gave me a 1 though. A 1? C&apos;mon now. I&apos;m not terribly conceited about my physical appearance, but I&apos;m not a fucking 1. Isn&apos;t a 1 missing teeth or an eye or something?</event>

			<subject>Topical</subject>
			<event>I was getting ready for my French class this morning and decided to be a little topical. So, for the verb consacre (meaning to dedicate as well as to consecrate) I decided on the sentence, &quot;A mosque is consecrated to the worship of God.&quot; Upon consulting my dictionary, I found the noun, &quot;worship&quot; is &quot;le culte.&quot; &quot;Interesting,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;a cult definitely has a different sense in English.&quot;

I thought nothing more about it until class when my teacher queried me as to what exactly I meant by that sentence. It turns out that the French word for cult is also &quot;culte.&quot; Fortunately for me my teacher knows my French sucks far too much to pull off a double entente like that.

Perhaps I should leave being topical until later...</event>

			<subject>Boxing</subject>
			<event>I went with some people the other night to try and find a TV to watch the Olympics. After a bit of looking we managed to find one at a hotel with a satellite. The only issue was that it was an Arab satellite and none of the stations had consistent coverage. We did manage though to catch some bits and pieces on news casts though. The most entertaining was a boxing match between Australia and Morocco.

Boxing normally isn&apos;t my sort of sport. Having seen it up close, it really is two guys just pounding the shit out of each other. Generally a bit too gruesome for me. If we could get commentators in the States though who are as unabashedly biased and emphatic as the Moroccan one was, I might give it a shot.

If you are a Muslim and you get bored, a nice pious way to pass the time is to start praying. In general praying is just recitation of verses from the Koran, the longer the better. The tonality of it is very flat and regular. It is chanting more so than anything. The vast majority of the commentary was like that; just a continual chant punctuated every so often with an &quot;imshi!&quot; (&quot;move!&quot;) directed at the Moroccan boxer. 

The part I think would most enhance American commentating though would be putting a little more God into beating the crap out of people. Whenever the Moroccan would land a solid hit on the Aussie it would prompt an al-humdillah (&quot;thanks to God&quot;) and if they&apos;d separate and there was a quiet bit there would be several inshallah&apos;s (&quot;if God wills [let us win]&quot;).

I guess it&apos;s only fair. God ought to be involved in everything you do, right? If you doesn&apos;t seem right bringing God into it, that suggests that perhaps you oughtn&apos;t to be doing it. I for one think it is kinda cool that they have managed to integrate the religious life so thoroughly.</event>

			<subject>Vermonster</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stder.org/~elw/&quot;&gt;Elijah&lt;/a&gt; is kind enough to give me web space since I was kicked off of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://honors.tntech.edu&quot;&gt;Honors server&lt;/a&gt;. I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Astderr.org&quot;&gt;Googling&lt;/a&gt; around his site and ran across a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.stderr.org/album07&quot;&gt;photolog&lt;/a&gt; of one of his friends eating a $35 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benjerry.com/&quot;&gt;Ben and Jerry&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; sundae called the &quot;Vermonster&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It consists of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20 scoops of ice cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 scoops of chopped walnuts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 ladles of hot fudge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 bananas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 chocolate chip cookies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 scoops of 4 toppings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 giant fudge brownie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whipped cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 large bucket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking maybe I&apos;ll fly into New York and make it back to Tennessee by way of Vermont since the only place I hear tales of this being sold is their Vermont headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something highly addictive in ice cream. I don&apos;t know what it is, but when I saw that bucket full o&apos; frozen goodness I&apos;d have sold my grandmother to slavers for a go at it. It&apos;s worse than heroin I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least during my month long readjustment sabbatical when I&apos;m holed up at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.holcomb.info/property/&quot;&gt;lake house&lt;/a&gt; watching all the movies I&apos;ve not seen in the last year, I&apos;m going to try and recreate it. Oh, what grand times those will be...&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m thinking I can make a pretty big dent in it. Consumption in volume was always a skill of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d be more than happy for company though if you find yourself with a free week or two you&apos;re more than free to come down and see how the place is shaping up. It should be a grand time. I&apos;m shooting for a Roman emperor sort of feel. Whatever my whims I&apos;ll indulge them. Perhaps a toga for effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on first being horribly sick with the richness of the food and then after I recover from that I reckon I&apos;ll gain about 15lbs. Perhaps I&apos;ll go out with my mom to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tva.gov/sites/sholston.htm&quot;&gt;dam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

			<subject>GRE</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;So, in principle I am eventually going to come back to the States and rejoin the &quot;civilized world.&quot; Not that I&apos;m looking forward to it especially, but that ol&apos; biological clock is a tickin&apos; and so I can&apos;t hang out in Africa forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current most appealing plan is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave Mauritania in Octoberish (stay an extra month to help in the transition with the person who will be taking my place)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel back to the States. I recently talked to someone who flew &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.royalairmaroc.com&quot;&gt;Air Maroc&lt;/a&gt; round trip from New York for $600, and I am hoping I can do it for about that&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend November and December practicing deep meditative states while watching DVD&apos;s at the lake house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;January to April move the burden from my parents to my extended family and travel around doing interviews on family history. (This is a project I&apos;d really like to see done for my kids and if I could get it done while most everyone is still alive, that&apos;d be great)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May to June head over land to Alaska with my two brothers and meet my mom up there for sightseeing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;July move to Berkeley, California and prepare to start grad school&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;August start into my computer engineering Ph.D. at UC-Berkeley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan is &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a dream. Me not working for nine months will likely be impossible. I&apos;ll only have $5000 coming out of the Peace Corps and that will dwindle quickly, I&apos;m sure. I would also have to make it into UC-Berkeley which is going to be nearly impossible, especially given my computer science undergrad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there is no harm in dreaming at this point... I am scheduled to take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gre.com&quot;&gt;GRE&lt;/a&gt; in October. I had to pick four schools and so I went with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eecs.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/&quot;&gt;Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ece.gatech.edu/&quot;&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecpe.vt.edu/&quot;&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I want in my grad school is to be sitting in a classroom and think, &quot;Oh my God, these people are all so much smarter than me. I am going to have to work so hard to keep up.&quot; I liked good ol&apos; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tntech.edu&quot;&gt;TTU&lt;/a&gt; good enough, but it did not incite those sorts of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<subject>Other Schools.</subject>
				<body>&lt;p&gt;Hrm, well first off, I can think of several other &quot;reach&quot; schools and just plain good schools you should try:
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unc.edu/&quot;&gt;UNC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uiuc.edu/index.html&quot;&gt;University Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cmu.edu/&quot;&gt;CMU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brown.edu/&quot;&gt;Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all have good CSC programs, and on some of my favourite sites(&lt;a href=&quot;http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/&quot;&gt;Lambda the Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) there are several really cool people who post to the site(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/&quot;&gt;Shriram Krisnamurthi&lt;/a&gt; from Brown is a good example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I would ditch Vandy, but that&apos;s just me(no offense to Dr. Talbert, I just don&apos;t think I would fit in the culture there, too antiauthoritarian. Hehe, I think the West Coast would be a &lt;b&gt;much&lt;/b&gt; better fit for me :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would prefer to just be able to communicate on the same level with people(higher would be cool too), but then again, I can&apos;t stand elitism and arrogance(and I admit I&apos;m not perfect, but I try).&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, you might want to check out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/201&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/&quot;&gt;Lamdba the Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, one of the replies &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ai.mit.edu/~gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg01421.html&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; a discussion I started on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.csail.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/ll-discuss&quot;&gt;Lightweight Languages&lt;/a&gt; mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Don&apos;t forget the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ai.mit.edu/~shivers/autoweapons.html&quot;&gt;Graduate Student&apos;s Guide to Automatic Weapons&lt;/a&gt; as long as you&apos;re thinking about grad school. Its chock full of valuable nuggets which have carried me through my first year(and hopefully beyond).&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>&lt;p style=&quot;border: thin solid gray; padding: 0.1em; margin-left: 2em; background-color: rgb(158, 213, 255);&quot;&gt;​They all have good CSC programs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m actually hoping to transition into computer engineering for grad school. I am really interested in actually producing things that make it out of the abstract world and have a physical form. When I&apos;m doing software work I can see the effects, but I don&apos;t get to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; stuff like you hardware guys do. I want that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That going to grad school in it is certainly debatable. I&apos;m looking at schools where CSC is in the engineering department, so maybe I&apos;ll have some flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

				<subject>Re: Other Schools.</subject>
				<body>&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve discussed this many times before. I think however you would be disappointed with an Engineering program of any sort(Software or CSC). To be honest, I would recommend a good circuit analysis class and some books like &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0387951504&quot;&gt;The Science of Radio&lt;/a&gt;. I realize other schools may be better, but many Engineers are lacking in software skills, and I think in CmpE program you found yourself, they would end up making you program, and you still wouldn&apos;t get the hardware experience. Plus, I know at Tech, the idea of &lt;b&gt;designing&lt;/b&gt; a circuit was a topic that was barely mentioned on the rarest of occasions. I mean, you need to know how to analyze circuits(and DiffE is involved in that, so beware :), but design is the hard part, and frankly, I don&apos;t know any place that teaches design. Its something that I myself would like to learn, and didn&apos;t in 6 years. I can design logic circuits, but really, other than very small stuff, all big stuff is done in VHDL(which is just another programming language...) because text is more efficient than pictures and building a large logic circuit is very difficult(I mean, shorts happen if two wires touch, and that is NOT a logic bug at all, I mean,  it would be like a compiler bug causing your program to execute wrong, okay, I realize your JavaScript experience means you can deal, but still, its whole nother element).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&apos;m not trying to discourage you from doing hardware. That&apos;s really not the point at all. Its just I think that you might find higher enjoyment from a purely theoretical CSC program. I would wager that the successful people who are concerned with &quot;practicalities&quot; are in industry, not academia. Academia excels at theory, and my experiences in Engineering research, and literature(both Soft and Hard) suggest to me that the words &quot;Ad Hoc&quot;  don&apos;t begin to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my research this summer, I was working with some guys on CNC machines. You don&apos;t get more real than that: its a robot that carves stuff out of metal :). The problem is they were more obsessed with creative research... so much so that I was told that originality trumps correctness, and getting it done trumps quality. So ditch that slow going &quot;mathematical&quot; understanding of stuff and make up something. The goal was publications, to keep the NSF grants flowing. If they ever get their machine to do anything, it will be because some lowly student accidentally accomplishes it, not because of their &quot;research&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self education has always worked for me. But then again, you may judge my experience to not be successful, so I dunno. I can help you with this if you like. Its all circuit analysis, but maybe that&apos;s something.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

			<subject>Prices</subject>
			<event>Question for the evening last night was, &quot;what would your price be for 30 minutes maximum of sexual activity?&quot;

It turns out that I am the cheapest date since I can be had for a mere four goats. Carl was second with 10 goats or alternately a well crafted paper mache rabbit stuffed with quality candies. His goal with the alternative was to not eliminate those with artistic talents, but lacking in worldly wealth.

Miriam was by far the priciest at $5000. (That&apos;s 10 camels!) She was accused of pricing herself out of the market especially when she said that she&apos;d have certain requirements about what exactly was and wasn&apos;t permissible behavior.

I think most of the difference came from her evaluating the question in terms of how much money it would take for her to compromise her values and me (having looser morals) thinking in terms of how much pleasure I think I could give someone in the half hour we allotted.

I can&apos;t come up with anything I could possibly do for someone in half an hour that would value $5000. Maybe if I could be a tour guide / love slave for a week in some exotic destination that could warrant it. My skills, which aren&apos;t nonexistent in the quick passion department, are decidedly stronger in the more emotionally involved area.

So far as blow jobs though, Miriam is a far better bargain than Carl who said it&apos;d take $100,000. Myself, $5000 sounds like a lot of money to me.

I remember reading something recently about how bisexuality is far more detrimental to the chances of a male engaging in sexual activity than a female. I need to work on the ardence of my heterosexuality.

A million dollars! It&apos;d take a million dollars for me to even see a guy naked. Touch his thingie? Never. Not if you held a gun to my head. Eww, that&apos;s just not natural. $5000? Hell no. Not unless he was really cute. I mean... Dammit.</event>

naked statue of a man. Then you could look without it being a &quot;real&quot; guy. I&apos;m being silly. Most naked men aren&apos;t cute. Naked bodies are a lot of things, but cute usually isn&apos;t one of them.  At least not after puberty sets in.

			<subject>Goals</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I have various and sundry things that I would like to accomplish at some point in my life. So far, major ones that I&apos;ve (sort of) accomplished:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learn to program computers
  &lt;li&gt;have a long term girlfriend
  &lt;li&gt;go to France and speak the language (I went to France and mangled the language, mais je suis all&amp;eacute; de toute fa&amp;ccedil;on.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves several (including):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learn sign language&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;visit Nepal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;watch (and comprehend) French TV&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;build something complicated and electronic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pay back the education department for fucking up my contract with them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get married&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One that I am toying with working on now is I think it would be really cool to see my abs before I die. Getting to the point that one can see their abs means being at 5-7% body fat. I&apos;ve been dropping a bit of fat thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminati.stderr.org/pipermail/jsfromtherim/2004-August/000306.html&quot;&gt;giardia&lt;/a&gt; and a generally poor diet, but I&apos;ve also dropped all muscle not required for movement. I&apos;d guess I&apos;m at 14-15%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;d be a good idea to get in shape for &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/ben/score_and_crash.mov&quot;&gt;WAIST&lt;/a&gt; anyway. Marc told me that I could join his gym for 5000um a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve got the money and the time. All that is required is
self-discipline. That is definitely something it would do me good to develop. A six-pack would be a nice bonus.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>You have no idea how much more I wish I&apos;d chosen your major than mine. You get to make &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;. Real stuff not just codify ideas in software. I like programming to be sure, but I&apos;d really like to know how to make &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; too. &amp;#x263A;

I&apos;m going to try really hard and transition that direction some for grad school. I&apos;m not sure that I want to live there permanently, but I&apos;d definitely like to be able to come visit. &amp;#x263A;

P.S. You ought to register for an account on &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;d save me having to copy and email my replies to you. I&apos;ve also got a couple entries that you can only read if you&apos;re one of my &lt;a href=&quot;/~ivankara/friends/&quot;&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt;.</body>

			<subject>Party Time</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I am recuperating from a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; long week. It started last Saturday and went something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saturday, August 28: spent most of the day getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/delirium/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Delirium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; htmlized and online. Slept in the bureau on the couch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sunday, August 29: worked on Delirium some more and went over to the Arc en Ciel auberge and in a classic lack of good sense stayed up all night watching movies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monday, August 30: was enrolled on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/nouakchott_notes/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nouakchott Notes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; staff and spent the whole day when I was supposed to be in meetings learning Pagemaker. That night was our mtr party for which I had downloaded seven hours of dance music and produced 40 liters of sangria.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuesday, August 31: I left the party at 5am and wandered to the bureau where I worked for about an hour before napping for a couple hours. I continued to work on Nouakchott Notes all day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wednesday, September 1: I pulled an all nighter working on &lt;i&gt;Notes&lt;/i&gt; and kept going pretty much all day. I am getting reasonably good at Pagemaker by this point. Also loosing the ability for coherent speech from lack of sleep. The long work day was broken by me wandering out to help someone change money. There are not undercover police officers posing as money changers and confiscating money and arresting people. Passed out on the floor of the hotel &quot;Welcome&quot; and spent the night in the middle of a roomful of people completely unconscious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thursday, September 2: Came back to put the finishing touches on &lt;i&gt;Notes&lt;/i&gt; and found that one of our two new ICT stagiaires had decided to go home. I decided to show her a few of the sights. After some Chinese food, ice cream, salsa dancing and gin I crashed at the Arc en Ciel again. (She also let me get a much needed shower.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friday, September 3: Spent the day visiting Nouakchott a bit, but mostly watching TV and chatting in the hotel. Saw her to her plane at 9pm and went home to be greeted by my surprised guardian who asked me if I&apos;d been on a trip for the last week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saturday, September 4: After some much needed sleep, spent today hanging out with another volunteer shopping for phones and pie pans. Headed out now to have some Mexican food with her and a Mauritanian who wants to work on his English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a good week, but exhausting. I&apos;m very happy with the &lt;i&gt;Nouakchott Notes&lt;/i&gt; though. I&apos;ve not gotten to make many pretty things in my life and it came out pretty good. I&apos;m definitely better prepared for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Newbies</subject>
			<event>We just recently lost one of our two ICT stagiaires. It is depressing because she was the most motivated and definitely the cutest of the two.

I think her decision took some thinking, but it came down to essentially that they assigned her to Aioun when she wanted to be in Nouakchott. Hector, who is the primary contact for the computer center in Aioun, and I, who is the primary contact for the Cisco Academy here in Nouakchott, both sent messages to Obie telling him that he&apos;d made the wrong choice in assignments. When I talked to him on the phone about it he made amorphous references to &quot;special considerations.&quot;

I&apos;ve now been hearing rumors that because of budget issues they have to cut down to 40 people before swearing in, in a week. They ought to be at 42 now. We&apos;ll have to see if they drop two more or not.

It just leaves me wondering if they put Lori in Aioun to cause her to ET. I&apos;ve not heard even the hint of a reasonable suggestion for their motivation yet and lots of reasons to not do what they did.

They are now talking about putting Jarad out there which I largely agree with, but I just wish they&apos;d talk to me about it. I have just felt completely out of the loop on all these decisions and it really frustrates me. It is causing me to rethink what I mean to the Peace Corps.</event>

Our latest party had recent hits from the BEP, Usher, Britney and Outkast.

The hardest thing here isn&apos;t the getting of the music as much as it is managing to be current enough to know what music to get.</body>

			<subject>Travelin&apos; Man</subject>
			<event>I have actually communicated interactively with &lt;a href=&quot;http://lofn.himinbi.org&quot;&gt;Steph&lt;/a&gt; again. We did a couple emails back and forth a couple week ago, but yesterday we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aol.com&quot;&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt;ed for a bit. It was entertaining.
 
One of the things that came up again is my life of leisure since I am headed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.world66.com/africa/mali&quot;&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt; in about two weeks for an excursion into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hullsgrove.com/DogonCountry.html&quot;&gt;Dogon Country&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsweek.com&quot;&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; ran an article on on Dogon a couple months ago and ranked it their top eco-tourism destination, but said to go now because it is changing under the influence of tourism.
 
This trip does come on the heels or my trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morocco.com&quot;&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.franceguide.com&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and the pig roast in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gouv.sn&quot;&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;. I definitely do travel a lot here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peacecorps.gov&quot;&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; get two days of vacation a month or 24 a year which isn&apos;t bad. I definitely want to use them all up.
 
They do come at a cost though. Since I have no appreciable savings I have to save any and all money I want to travel on. (Or beg it from my mom, which I don&apos;t like doing.) Fortunately everything here is really cheap, so it is not impossible, but it definitely takes sacrifices.
 
For this Mali trip I needed a budget of about $400 to make it through a week and a half. Hiring a guide for Dogon pushes the price up considerably. So, I&apos;ve changed all but 7000um to dollars and I have enough. That leaves me about 500um a day to eat on.
 
500um is about $1.50 a day. Even here in Mauritania that isn&apos;t a whole lot of money. If I was eating communally with a family it would be fine. Living on my own though it means, for instance, that my meals for today will consist of pasta with sugar and cinnamon for breakfast/lunch and dinner will be probably a sandwich.
 
I&apos;m pretty sure most anyone in the world living in a 15&apos;x10&apos; apartment with a bathroom and eating largely pasta could manage to save enough to take some trips. Especially if the trip was to go camping like this one is. I&apos;m sort of looking forward to being back in the States because I feel very comfortable getting by on very little. I&apos;m hoping I can keep up the travel thing. I just have to find a job flexible enough to let me do it. I suppose at the high end that is contract work and at the low end temp work. Maybe my dreams of professorship will some day come true.</event>

			<subject>Wuthering</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Said by Catherine in chapter IX of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/768&quot;&gt;Wuthering Heights&lt;/a&gt; (my favorite romantic novel and book for the day):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff&apos;s miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it. &amp;mdash; My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I&apos;m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; Heathcliff! He&apos;s always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don&apos;t talk of our separation again: it is impracticable; and &amp;hellip;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is bad right? All of my training to date labels this as nothing more than extreme &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allaboutcounseling.com/codependency.htm&quot;&gt;codependence&lt;/a&gt;. It does sound nice though. I think it is just the push toward the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartbeat2000.com/ego.htm&quot;&gt;annihilation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://resume.himinbi.org/csc_203_long_paper.html#appendix-peck&quot;&gt;ego&lt;/a&gt; coupled with absolute connection. I lose who I am in you and at the same time find myself there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it maintainable though? Is it a illusion destined for collapse?&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Projet du Jour: Calendriers</subject>
			<event>I woke up this morning feeling like I wanted to do something, but not really wanting to much about with setting up the lab which is going to be a really involved process. So, I decided to repair my old &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/get_calendar/&quot;&gt;calendar getter&lt;/a&gt;.

It goes on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://page-a-day.com&quot;&gt;Page-a-Day Calendars&lt;/a&gt; site and can download any calendars you have access to and send them to you.

A goal of mine over the next year is to clean up a good many of the partially finished programs I&apos;ve got lying around and make a useful website presenting them.</event>

			<subject>Seriously Though, Calendars?</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Ok, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/4229.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; seem a bit boring? Calendars? From a shell script? Umm, ok, that&apos;s something you can use Will, but what about the rest of the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I didn&apos;t want to post the rest of the story publicly. I&apos;m gun-shy since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tntech.edu/&quot;&gt;TTU&lt;/a&gt; kicked me off the &lt;a href=&quot;http://honors.tntech.edu&quot;&gt;Honors Server&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/speeches/&quot;&gt;copyright violations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neat thing I discovered while fixing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/get_calendar/&quot;&gt;calendar getter&lt;/a&gt; is a bug in their system. I was doing my working and getting different calendars and then I realized that my account wasn&apos;t supposed to be able to get at the calendars I was downloading. It turns out that I can download &lt;a href=&quot;http://page-a-day.com/catalog/2004_pad.html&quot;&gt;any calendar&lt;/a&gt; I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that I can resurrect my old page-a-day lists. They should start back up tomorrow. (They&apos;re named in honor of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordsmith.org/awad/&quot;&gt;Word-a-Day&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordsmith.org/awad/&quot;&gt;AWAD&lt;/a&gt;) list.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://honors.tntech.edu/mailman/listinfo/azad&quot;&gt;A Zen Quote A Day&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://page-a-day.com/catalog/preview_2004/0761129251.html&quot;&gt;The Little Zen Calendar&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://honors.tntech.edu/mailman/listinfo/atad&quot;&gt;A Trivia Question A Day&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://page-a-day.com/catalog/preview_2004/0761128395.html&quot;&gt;365 Amazing Trivia Facts Calendar&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://honors.tntech.edu/mailman/listinfo/amqad&quot;&gt;A Mensa Question A Day&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://page-a-day.com/catalog/preview_2004/0761128158.html&quot;&gt;365 Mensa Brain Puzzlers Calendar&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you feel like getting some wisdom or testing you knowledge, feel free to sign up. You can tell people too, just don&apos;t post it on the web because I&apos;m much afeared of getting in trouble now-a-days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple more I&apos;d like to make lists out of, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://page-a-day.com/catalog/preview_2004/076112828X.html&quot;&gt;Book Lover&apos;s Calendar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://page-a-day.com/catalog/preview_2004/0761128506.html&quot;&gt;365 Jokes, Puns and Riddles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://page-a-day.com/catalog/preview_2004/0761129294.html&quot;&gt;Zobmondo: 365 Odious Options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://page-a-day.com/catalog/preview_2004/0761130837.html&quot;&gt;Fact or Crap: It&apos;s Your Call&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues though are two fold. For each calendar I want to access I have to have the four letter code assigned to it. It is something that makes sense, like ZENN for the Zen calendar and MENS for the Mensa one. For some of these though I don&apos;t know the code and so would have to put in some guessing time. Secondly though, since I no longer have a server, I can&apos;t make new lists. I&apos;m thinking about looking into a mail to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com&quot;&gt;Livejournal&lt;/a&gt; gateway program. (A free one since I&apos;ve not got even $15 to my name right now.) Maybe I&apos;ll serialize these to a LiveJournal or maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/~titivillus/&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;&apos;ll get his privacy options built into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.titivillus.net/panopticon/&quot;&gt;Panopticon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Les Jeuxs Que Les Gens Jeuent</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been spending time this summer (when not &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminati.stderr.org/pipermail/jsfromtherim/2004-August/000307.html&quot;&gt;locked out&lt;/a&gt;) preparing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisco-academy.mr/&quot;&gt;my lab&lt;/a&gt; for next semester. Most of it is just getting all the operating systems standardized and setting up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samba.org&quot;&gt;domain controller&lt;/a&gt; and what-not. One of my more illicit projects though has been getting the place set up to host a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lanparty.com&quot;&gt;lan party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, a lan party is a simple thing. You get a big open space, everyone brings their computers and you connect them together. The most common sort of lan party centers around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.machall.com&quot;&gt;gaming&lt;/a&gt;, but there are other sorts as well, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ht04.org/workshops/OSCOMHackathon/index.php&quot;&gt;hackathons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://luna.yottadot.org/myegallery.php?&amp;do=showgall&amp;gid=6&quot;&gt;installfests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick in Mauritania is that no one owns a computer. To aid my poor deprived friends, I am getting these computers set up to let them play on. I just finished installing this morning the second major representative type of game. Already present, to represent first person shooters, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unrealtournament.com/ut2003/&quot;&gt;Unreal Tournament 2003&lt;/a&gt;. To compliment it in the category of real time strategy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blizzard.com/war3/&quot;&gt;WarCraft III&lt;/a&gt;. This lets people choose to spend their time running around blowing their friends into little meaty chunks, or building armies, fortifying cities and waging ceaseless war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really entertaining bit for me though is that they are both in French. So in UT when I electrocute my hapless opponent, my character cries &quot;c&apos;est chez moi&quot; or &quot;ça doit faire mal.&quot; That entertains me as much as the game itself. I spent a good 15 minutes in W3 finding different characters to irritate and hear their various exclamations. Being able to speak French would kick ass; everything is just cuter in French.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>oh, oh, and from experience sitting around a computer cafe a few times when all the campus labs were closed over xmas break while i was in france.... you&apos;ve got to learn the proper french responses!  i don&apos;t remember the positive ones really, but there were definitely plenty of choruses of &quot;putain!&quot; every few seconds.  not sure whether this is the same thing these guys would use in a proper lan party, but i suspect so -- i never perceived much taboo on the use of any particular words in public.</body>

				<subject>re: cuteness</subject>
				<body>Cuter? Perhaps not. Sexy? Have you ever heard someone speaking English with a French accent? Dear sweet baby Jesus, that&apos;s sexy! Even the most attractive of us could do occasionally with a bit of le français from time to time.

The key though is intelligibility. I&apos;ve got French friends here whose accents are decidedly not sexy. They would be if I wasn&apos;t spending so much time trying to decipher what they are trying to say that I&apos;ve not got time to think about anything else.

I think my French is progressing though. I&apos;m asking for stuff in restaurants and simply have people nod rather than ask me to repeat myself at least half the time now. I also had a couple of times hanging out with a group of volunteers (from en brusse) when I was asked to be the speaker since my French was the best in the group. Granted no one else at all spoke French, just Hassiniya and Pulaar, but it made me feel nice quand même.</body>

I think we did agree that lil&apos; children whining in French was cuter that whining in English, but that may have just been b/c I couldn&apos;t understand a word of it.</body>

			<subject>Revving Up</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;It looks like my life is going to be quite a bit busier this next year...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisco-academy.mr/contacts.html&quot;&gt;Malick&lt;/a&gt; and he told me his contract is up in November and he is not going to extend it. This comes on the heels of Hassen saying he is not working with the university this next semester. Also, if Dia is not already gone, he will be out of here as soon as these trainings are done. With Matt having switched his alliance to the wheat company, that just leaves me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting and wanting to be more involved this year. My French is nearly not wretched and I&apos;m developing a sense for how things work here. There is a big difference though between getting to the point where I can deal with being more active in teaching a class and getting to where I can deal with the confused snarl that is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.univ-nkc.mr/&quot;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is going to be interesting in any case. I need to sit down with Malick and have a nice long talk about how anything gets done here at all.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I got my ballot in today. Cast it for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnkerry.com/&quot;&gt;Kerry&lt;/a&gt; since I&apos;m pretty sure &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.georgewbush.com/&quot;&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; increases my chances of getting my ass kicked living in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mauritania.mr/&quot;&gt;Islamic republic&lt;/a&gt; about 20 times. This is a place where rulers are not always liked. (As evidenced by the number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3703694.stm&quot;&gt;coup attempts&lt;/a&gt; in the last month.) Right now most people I talk to assume that the American people are at least partially against many of Bush&apos;s actions. They will tell me that Bush is a bad man, but they still like Americans. If we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electoral-vote.com/&quot;&gt;re-relect&lt;/a&gt; him our culpability changes entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the congressional seat I wrote in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.holcomb.info/jim/jim_fishing.jpg&quot;&gt;dad&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s name. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/states/frosh/9701/02b/&quot;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; can bite my ass. I don&apos;t think my dad wants the seat anymore, but I think he deserves it.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Le Carême</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catholicherald.org/archives/articles/lenthistory.html&quot;&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt; is a period celebrated primarily by Catholics and beginning 48 days before &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reality.org.nz/articles/44/44-simmonds.html&quot;&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt;. It begins with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pmms.cam.ac.uk/~gjm11/poems/ashwed.html&quot;&gt;Ash Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, the day after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/shrovetuesday.shtml&quot;&gt;Shrove Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mardigrasday.com&quot;&gt;Mardi Gras&lt;/a&gt;. The period is really 40 days long to line up with other biblical periods of purgation like Jesus&apos; &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0095497/&quot;&gt;desert sabbatical&lt;/a&gt;, Noah&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0158828/&quot;&gt;flood&lt;/a&gt; and Moses&apos; &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0049833/&quot;&gt;search for Canaan&lt;/a&gt;. Not being made of the same stuff as biblical heroes, we mere morals get Sundays off, therefore 48 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/society/A0816577.html&quot;&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for the Sunday after the first full moon on or after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/VernalEquinox.html&quot;&gt;vernal equinox&lt;/a&gt; (the first day of spring). The Western church takes the equinox to be March 21. (The Eastern Orthodox does not necessarily and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.factmonster.com/spot/easter1.html&quot;&gt;doesn&apos;t always have the same date&lt;/a&gt; for Easter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presidents&apos; Day (which is really &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.factmonster.com/spot/washington1.html&quot;&gt;Washington&apos;s Birthday&lt;/a&gt;) is the third Monday in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year the lineup of these holidays will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ash Wednesday &amp;bull; February 9&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&quot;Presidents&apos; Day&quot; &amp;bull; February 21&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easter &amp;bull; March 27&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why,&quot; I can hear you thinking, &quot;do we care?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, traditionally Catholics recognize Lent by not eating meat on Fridays and being more charitable. This is, in my opinion, both too easy and boring. Since I&apos;m a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yakrider.com/Tao/Taoism_Daoism.htm&quot;&gt;philosophical Taoist&lt;/a&gt; and not Catholic I like to make up my own disciplines better suited to my needs. Highlights from the past have included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No caffeine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Daily meditation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20 days without talking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No masturbation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No profanity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year&apos;s was interesting: no speaking English to French speakers. (I live in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mauritania.mr&quot;&gt;francophone country&lt;/a&gt;, so most everyone speaks French.) Given the wretched state of my French I spent a lot of time in silence and perfecting my hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to why this eccentricity matters as to the occurrence of Presidents&apos; Day; in a word WAIST: the West African International Softball Tournament. I&apos;ve mentioned this before this is a big event here; literally the social event of the year. You&apos;ve played on team before and you&apos;re out there playing and cheering and having fun. Ok, for three solid days, do that with 40 or so people that you&apos;ve grown really close to through shared tribulation (like being thrown in the desert and expected to survive). For every night go out to parties and dancing. On top add being put up in cushy expat houses which have luxuries such as breakfast cereal and cheese. All in all it makes for an amazing weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WAIST is held Presidents&apos; Day weekend. This year Presidents&apos; Day falls within Lent. My current plan is to do the whole no English bit again, at least for the weekends. As much fun as spending all my time in silence would be, I&apos;d rather not. Enter the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05041a.htm&quot;&gt;dispensations&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not going to just take the weekend off. I&apos;m a fan of actions having their consequences and me having to adapt to meet them. Just taking the weekend off means that I was presented with something challenging and I responded by making my my task less difficult. Nothing inherently wrong with that except that I&apos;m doing it in the first place for the growth that comes from the challenge, so taking the easy way out is counter productive. At the same time I think being completely inflexible and just making myself speak French is not the right solution either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&apos;m going to set up a challenge that, if met, grants me a dispensation for the weekend. Since last year nearly killed me physically I figure I want to make it a physical challenge. So, I&apos;ve decided on two options, either of which will take serious work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be at 10% or less body fat (I&apos;m at 16% currently, so lose 12lbs of fat)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be able to bench press more than my weight (I&apos;m really weak right now and can bench about 100lbs, I weigh 177lbs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there is is. I have a goal now...&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/~ivankara/5513.html&quot;&gt;dispensations&lt;/a&gt; are off to a less than stellar start...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the name of &quot;protein loading&quot; Marc and I had a meat party. He brought some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cattaneobros.com/Products/Sausage/Chorizo/chorizo.html&quot;&gt;chorizo&lt;/a&gt; that came fresh from Spain with some volunteers. I brought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/pubs/cornbeef.htm&quot;&gt;corned beef&lt;/a&gt; and tuna from a new Chinese supermarket that just opened. These combined with some pilfered cheese and mayonnaise made for some tasty sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we only ate about a third of the corned beef and the house where we were invading was rapidly becoming permeated with the scent of potted meat. To remedy the situation I decided to try and finish the rest of the block off. We were out of bread, so I just set into it with some mayo and a fork. I managed to make it about halfway before I remembered the diet bit and just went and threw it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fun part was yet to come though. From the meat party we set out to the gym to put our newly acquired protein to work. The last time I was in a gym was probably June; June 2003. For the record, a meat party is not the best preparation for an end to a two year gym sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 15 minutes in my body tabled a motion. &quot;I move that we cover this place with corned beef and chorizo,&quot; it said. &quot;Interesting æsthetic choice,&quot; I responded, &quot;but I suspect the management might not appreciate it.&quot; &quot;Boors, c&apos;mon, you and I have vision. It will really liven this place up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I was only able to stave it off with a filibuster of &quot;donthrowup, donthrowup, donthrowup, donthrowup, donthrowup...&quot; chanted for about five minutes while sitting on the floor. I think that everyone was better off with the only color I added to the place being the disturbing shade of green I took on while exercising my mantra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did do a little lifting though. I can&apos;t really start anything serious though because the gym is going to close for a month starting on the 15th for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.factmonster.com/spot/ramadan1.html&quot;&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose it&apos;s meilleur que rien, n&apos;est pas?&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Damnation, I&apos;m sick. I had a cold that was going around and instead of getting better like it did for everyone else it seems to have settled in my chest to take up residence. I&apos;m hoping for bronchitis or pneumonia. There has been quite a bit of tuberculosis going around and I&apos;d rather not have that. I&apos;m headed in Monday to get a TB skin test...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is TB, then I&apos;m going to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0108358/&quot;&gt;Tombstone&lt;/a&gt; somewhere and watch it until I perfect &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/name/nm0000174/&quot;&gt;Val Kilmer&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s accent. That&apos;ll be my new consumption voice. If it bugs folks, screw &apos;em; they don&apos;t have consumption. I think it warrants some liberties.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Transitions</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;There is a girl named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daraevans.com&quot;&gt;Dara&lt;/a&gt; who was in town for a while getting a pesky case of dysentery treated. At the same time I was hanging out in the computer lab a lot trying to get some systems up and running for a lab out en brusse. As a consequence we ended up spending a good bit of time together and both enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Things were stayed at a platonic level. After she was gone I took a trip to Mali and was there with the girl who was the front runner in my list of potentials. As I hung out with her I found not only that there didn&apos;t seem to be much possibility, but also that I was finding the idea of dating Dara more attractive. After I got back we started sending &lt;a href=&quot;http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid40_gci213660,00.html&quot;&gt;SMS messages&lt;/a&gt; back and forth that were getting progressively more flirtatious, but never crossing the line.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;One night a few days ago I tried ecstasy for the first time. It was during this fun time that things shifted:&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dara: 10/08/04: 19H41&lt;/em&gt; Quick, think of some way i could get to nouakchott w/o being sick. Things really suck down here&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;To which I responded that things were not much better in Nouakchott. We had to pay 500um to get back from the beach and the ecstasy didn&apos;t seem to be working.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dara: 10/08/04: 21H&lt;/em&gt; Whatever funny guy... I am feeling better but going to bed. Hope u don&apos;t od... I want to see u again... I might have a little surprise for u, wink, wink.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;At this point Jess took my phone and responded with &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace&quot;&gt;I sooo wish you were here&lt;/span&gt;.&quot; I followed it up with a question as to whether casual drug usage was a serious character flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dara: 10/08/04: 21H21&lt;/em&gt; Not a problem... if u will forgive me for two things... drinking too much soda &amp;amp; dreaming about u every night :)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hmm,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;this would be a transition.&quot; Far sweeter that I would have done, but I am generally lascivious and obscure. It is part of my charm.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;This leaves us in something of a tenuous position though. I&apos;m swamped under work and I can&apos;t get out of town before the end of the month. She is in her first three months and could get in some serious trouble coming here, especially with all the security scares going on currently. I&apos;m heading down to Ka&amp;eacute;di for Halloween, but that is nearly three weeks away. I think it would be manageable if we could put a hold on things somehow. That isn&apos;t possible. So the emotional bits are continuing to move with absolutely no datum on the physical bits.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;It sounds shallow to me to be concerned about the physical aspects of a relationship, but that is what makes a romance for me. I&apos;ve got several good friends that I&apos;m very emotionally intimate with. The difference in a romance? I don&apos;t fuck my friends. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Nuts</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I just hate deleting these. If you knew the girl, you&apos;d know how out of her normal character this is. I think that is what makes it so entertaining...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 75%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jess is headed down and taking some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nestle.com/&quot;&gt;Nestle&lt;/a&gt; Mont Blanc. I bought it because it was 400um (regularly 1200um), and them remembered my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/~ivankara/5513.html&quot;&gt;dispositions&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&apos;t know what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praline&quot;&gt;praline&lt;/a&gt; was exactly though, only having seen the term in conjunction with ice cream. I was debating between it being a confection like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipegoldmine.com/scratch/scratch252.htm&quot;&gt;caramel&lt;/a&gt; and a nut, so when asking Dara if she liked pralines I also asked if she knew if they were nuts. Her response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dara: 10/10/04: 18H07&lt;/em&gt; Can&apos;t answer that. The only nuts i like r peanuts &amp;amp; &amp;hellip; yeah, nevermind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 75%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next one is intriguing more so than cute. I laid out my plans leading up to Halloween:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Oct 23: Take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gre.org&quot;&gt;GRE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senegal-online.com/anglais/villes/richard-toll/&quot;&gt;Richard Toll&lt;/a&gt; and find molasses and whiskey&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Catch the shuttle to Ka&amp;eacute;di&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Oct 31: Shake my booty&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Oct 31: Watch some porn&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Oct 31: Get drunk with Hitch&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Oct 31: Make out with Dara&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Nov 2: Watch the elections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In approximately that order. Her response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dara: 10/11/04: 7H50&lt;/em&gt; I had a feeling that was ur goal. My goal&amp;hellip; to enjoy myself in every way possible&amp;hellip; so we have the same goals, nice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 75%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I just want the opportunity to reconcile the reasonably quiet girl I hung out with a few weeks ago and the incipient nymphomaniac text messaging me.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Well, by all reports, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/5899.html&quot;&gt;hacking cough&lt;/a&gt; is only bronchitis and not tuberculosis. Until I start coughing up blood or the chest X-ray I&apos;m getting indicate so, my positive TB skin test will only indicate exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, most of the time when people are exposed to TB their bodies wall off the infection in their lungs. So, you have it, but it isn&apos;t really doing anything to you. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/G/20021761.html&quot;&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of it are taken once a day for 270 days. They have to first break down the wall your body has built and then kill the TB. If I was older, I would have to go off alcohol for nine months while taking them. As it is, my young liver should let me imbibe occassionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me remembering to take a pill every day for nine months... Suck.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;It is so completely and totally in my best interests to see that &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcvalentin.smugmug.com&quot;&gt;these pictures&lt;/a&gt; are never seen by anyone. Marc has a strange fascination with taking pictures where I look idiotic and putting them on the web. From our recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcvalentin.smugmug.com/gallery/247982&quot;&gt;Mali trip&lt;/a&gt; there is a whole series of Will asleep pictures. I can&apos;t help it though; they are just too fuckin&apos; funny not to share.&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>I am definitely in the worst shape I have been in for the last ten years. I never move. I work in front of a computer all day and it is too damned hot to exercise most of the time.

My weight is about the same actually, I&apos;ve just dropped all my muscle and replaced it with fat. It is pitiful. I&apos;ve got a friend from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bartertheatre.com/&quot;&gt;Abingdon&lt;/a&gt; who is headed home in a couple months to be a bridesmaid. She ordered her dress two inches smaller than she is right now. I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/5513.html&quot;&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt; thing going on, so we both have our motivation.

The plan is to start taking morning bike rides around town. Jogging would have been better exercise, but too much work. Best to start small.

As for the hair it doesn&apos;t get cut til next February, so it will be the longest it has ever been. It was getting really unmanageable, but I picked up some conditioner in Mali and that has helped a bit.</body>

				<body>I suppose that&apos;s fair. The magic of the internet makes cobbling a picture together pretty easy.

As for the ring... I wear it because it isn&apos;t time to take it off yet. I&apos;m still processing through our relationship in a way that I think warrants wearing it.

It is also pretty much the only piece of jewelry that was ever given to me, and it was you who gave it to me (or lent it and I have absconded), so that makes it special.</body>

				<body>Yeah, this is my penance for not being able to grow appreciable facial hair. I can&apos;t take part in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://studs.mr.pcvs.org&quot;&gt;moustaches&lt;/a&gt; for WAIST, so I&apos;m growing my hair out. I&apos;ve got a couple people who want me to dred it and I&apos;m considering.

I am going to try and pitch again for the losing team. I&apos;m going to table the proposition that if we win one game I&apos;ll shave the sides and spend the day with a mullet.

I&apos;ll only be young and stupid once. Well, young at least. &amp;#x263A;</body>

				<body>Yeah. I told you that I was going to keep wearing it. It hasn&apos;t been off my hang since I got here. You told me the situation under which you would not want me wearing it and I agreed. That situation has, as of yet, to come up. 

The girl with me in the picture is the wife of a friend of mine. No fooling around there.</body>

			<subject>Serrures et Cadenas</subject>
			<event>I arrived at my house at 1am last night completely worn out after a long day trying to get computers to work. I drug myself up to my door and put the key in the lock. It turned about halfway and then stuck completely, much to my distress. I tried turning it back and it wouldn&apos;t. I tried jiggling it to no avail.

I couldn&apos;t just crank on it because the lock, like most everything here, was made in China. Nothing against the Chinese, but their choice of fabrication materials is sometimes strange. For instance my keys would at first glance appear to be made of steel, like keys back in the States. Given the strength of the metal though, it is much more likely that it is made out of very thick aluminum foil. This means that even my most meager of attempts were bending the key and threatening to break it off.

Eventually I just gave it a yank that pulled it out of the lock. I then found I couldn&apos;t get it back in. Again, recall that the setting is me standing exhausted in front of my house at 1am after a good 12 hours at the university.

I take a look around and argue the wisdom of sleeping on the sidewalk. A minute passes and I trudge out to buy a sandwich walk on over to Marc&apos;s. I get to his place about 2am and crash exhausted on his couch, not to awaken until my French teacher calls me at 9am the next morning to ask me why I&apos;m not at home.

&quot;Ugh,&quot; I think to myself and wander back home.

I don&apos;t know what the hell I did to that lock, but the quote that came to mind was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0129387/&quot;&gt;Something About Mary&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;How in the world did you get the beans above the frank?&quot; There are a set of pins that are pushed up by the key. There are breaks in each one at different places and the different heights on the key make the breaks line up so the tumbler can turn. Somehow my exploits of the night before had gotten is so that pins lined up with the flat side of the key rather than the bumpy side.

A locksmith came in to try and open the door, but not surprisingly he was not successful. Eventually he just went at it with a hammer and screw driver. He managed to destroy the inside of the tumbler and remove the pins, but it still wouldn&apos;t turn. So, he just took a crowbar and pried at the door until the bolt snapped. I suppose that cheap materials sometimes have their advantages.

I&apos;d not really noticed, but the now destroyed lock is not attached to my door with screws. Instead it is welded straight to the metal of the door; making it irreplaceable without calling in a welder. Great.

My house is now secured with a big padlock. It ought to be fine though.</event>

			<subject>re: voting methods</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;This is something I wrote in reply to a message on a list I am on. It is something I find interesting, so I wanted to put it here too&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;background-color: rgb(248, 225, 244); color: black; border: thin solid rgb(168, 113, 158); margin-left: 2em; padding: .5em;&quot;&gt;What are everyones thoughts on the instant runoff ballot?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://accuratedemocracy.com&quot;&gt;Voting process reform&lt;/a&gt; is one of the things I think the US really needs to put into place and that there is no substantial reason not to do. As it is, all that we are doing is knowingly using a system that doesn&apos;t put people in office in accordance with the desires of the people as much as possible. It is like driving with a flat tire. No one is going to somehow argue that driving with a flat is good for a car. Likewise, who is going to argue that a democracy should not have leaders in accordance with the desires of the people?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;There are things like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electionmethods.org/college.htm&quot;&gt;electoral college&lt;/a&gt; which center around a debate as to whether to define &quot;the people&quot; geographically or by simple majority. That the system should represent the will of the electorate is unchanged though.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;background-color: rgb(248, 225, 244); color: black; border: thin solid rgb(168, 113, 158); margin-left: 2em; padding: .5em;&quot;&gt;Cons?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve read up on the issue because the math of determining the will of the people as effectively as possible really interests me.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fairvote.org&quot;&gt;Instant runoff&lt;/a&gt; is essentially what you describe. I get a ballot, I rank the candidates. The ballots are counted, whoever has the least number of votes is eliminated and their second choices given their votes. This continues until only one person is left.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the system only works properly if the party I am choosing over one of the primaries is going to for sure loose...&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say I mark my ballot:&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Nader&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Kerry&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Bush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;In principle, Nader will get eliminated in the first round with my token vote counted and my &quot;real&quot; vote going to Kerry.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that a bunch of people doing just what I did could possibly cause Kerry to lose in the first round since even though he may on average be ranked higher, he received fewer first round votes. Nader may then be eliminated in the second round leaving Bush the winner. So, the ability for a third party candidate to spoil the election is still present. It just changes it so that the third party candidate has to be strong enough to push one of the major contenders
out of the first round.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;A site I like on this issue is, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electionmethods.org&quot;&gt;www.electionmethods.org&lt;/a&gt;. They have a listing of different criteria laid out as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electionmethods.org/evaluation.htm&quot;&gt;mathematical axioms&lt;/a&gt; and situations where various voting procedures (mainly IRV, since it is the most well-known) fail.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>more on voting</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I got a reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/7535.html&quot;&gt;my post on voting methods&lt;/a&gt; saying essentially, &quot;if Nader makes it through the first round he is more fit to run against Bush and anyone putting Nader is going to put Kerry second anyhow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a valid critique of the particular example I gave, but not of the actual issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we have two parties. I fully expect this to remain true until we see some sort of voting process reform because any third party will necessarily draw more heavily from one party than the other, weakening it. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politicalcompass.org&quot;&gt;political spectrum&lt;/a&gt; though there is everything from communists to anarchists. All in all our two parties are not that markedly different. They can&apos;t be. They have to stay near the middle of the bell curve in order to garner enough political support to seriously oppose the other party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone voting for a third party candidate right now would almost certainly put the main party candidates in the same order. I.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gp.org&quot;&gt;Green party&lt;/a&gt; voters would put Kerry before Bush and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lp.org&quot;&gt;libertarians&lt;/a&gt; the opposite. In a system with a wider spectrum of positions this would not necessarily be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, imagine if there was a candidate who was generally attractive to one party, but who had some unpopular opinions on a couple single voter issues like abortion or gun control. One of the things about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.votenader.org&quot;&gt;Nader campaign&lt;/a&gt; is that he has not gotten very much press coverage of his actual positions. His language in general is very &lt;a href=&quot;http://youthdebate.newvotersproject.org&quot;&gt;straightforward&lt;/a&gt; and if this was actually making it into the media more, there are almost certainly be a significant number of people who would not want to see him elected. (Mostly Bush supporters, but we are giving him some hypothetical positions unpalatable to moderate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dnc.org&quot;&gt;democrats&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine then that there are lots of democrats who like the idea of him getting elected, but those moderate ones who don&apos;t like him would rather see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.georgewbush.com&quot;&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; in office. So the ballots could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;35% Bush, Kerry, Nader&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;34% Nader, Kerry, Bush&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;16% Kerry, Bush, Nader&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15% Kerry, Nader, Bush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Kerry gets pushed out in the first round because he has 31% (#3 (16%) + #4 (15%)) which is less than Nader&apos;s 34% (#2) or Bush&apos;s 35% (#1). Kerry&apos;s seconds then get divvied up and Bush wins 51% (#1 (35%) + #3 (16%)) to Nader&apos;s 49% (#2 (34%) + #4 (15%)). This is despite the fact that 65% (#2 (34%) + #3 (16%) + #4 (15%)) of people preferred Kerry to Bush. These numbers are close, but this is not really a fringe case. I just kept them close to try and show realism. This is something that can happen under a variety of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that I am against instant runoff as an alternative to plurality. I just think that the possible drawbacks need to be known.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Être au Régime</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;The only edible things in my house are a jar of mayonnaise, some beef jerky and vegetable shortening. So, upon getting up this morning breakfast possibilities were sorely limited. There&apos;s a boutique right around the corner that sells fruit and cereal and all sorts of appropriate breakfast fares. In the end though, not surprisingly, lethargy won out and I dined on tasty beef jerky dipped in mayonnaise. Yum, the breakfast of champions. Champions of what I&apos;m not sure, something surely&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I have been feeling a bit nauseous most of the morning. I hope I&apos;m not coming down with anything.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>GRE</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Well, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gre.org&quot;&gt;GRE&lt;/a&gt; is all done with. All in all I found it distressingly easy. I was taking the paper version and since the nearest testing center is in Egypt and I don&apos;t feel like paying $600 to take a four hour test. The questions on the paper version are grouped in sets of easy, medium and hard. I kept getting to hard questions and thinking them easy. This leaves two possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am amazingly intelligent and capable of such quick discernment that the questions were beneath me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The questions included a trick that changed the answer and I missed the trick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I couldn&apos;t generally see the trick, #2 is significantly more likely. I&apos;ll find out in about two months one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice break though was the essay question. The prompt was something like, &quot;a university education should offer a breadth of courses to &apos;truly educate&apos; a student.&quot; One of the courses I took at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tntech.edu&quot;&gt;TTU&lt;/a&gt; for entrance into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://honors.tntech.edu&quot;&gt;Honors Program&lt;/a&gt; was Honors 101. For that class we had to do a paper where we went around interviewing various people on four subjects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The purpose of a university education&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The function of the sciences in a university education&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The function of the humanities in a university education&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The meaning of life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I had already written this essay. It was better than that though because later in college I went to a couple conferences and was part of a panel that talked about the pedagogy of Honors 101 and my part of the presentation was the paper. Depending on time I would often summarize some of the different positions that students might take on the issues. In short, I spanked it. Not that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; will care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did though do my essay in pen and that is an error whose magnitude has as of yet to be seen. There was nothing on the sheet to tell me not to do it in pen, but in the instructions for the test it mentioned not using pens in general. So, hopefully they don&apos;t throw out my scores for illegal ink usage.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Voyagé</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve not been having many new experiences as of late. I&apos;ve certainly not drained Mauritania, but having been here for almost 500 days now I&apos;ve decidedly carved a niche. So, my first taxi ride by myself was something of a treat&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;7:30&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daraevans.com&quot;&gt;Dara&lt;/a&gt; kicks me getting out of the mosquito net. (Halloween was a time for a couple of new horizons.) I mumble a bit, roll over and go back to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;9:30&lt;/em&gt; - I wake up again to find myself nearly floating in a pool of sweat. The sun came up about 8:00 and since I&apos;m on the roof I&apos;ve been baking for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;9:45&lt;/em&gt; - I toss the matelas off the roof wander downstairs with the mosquito net tucked under my arm. The enticing scent of eggs and potatoes frying is on the air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;9:50&lt;/em&gt; - I&apos;m sitting eating some purloined eggs and thinking about how nice life is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;10:15&lt;/em&gt; - I continue my campaign of moral degradation by convincing Dara to take a nap rather than being responsible and going shopping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;12:00&lt;/em&gt; - Dara finally heads out to run her errands and we say goodbye. I am headed to the garage as soon as I take a shower.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;12:15&lt;/em&gt; - I get out of the shower.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;13:00&lt;/em&gt; - I look up from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553287893/qid=1099605755/&quot;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; and jar of olives (the only edible thing left in the house) and think about leaving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;13:30&lt;/em&gt; - I actually pack up my stuff and head out the door.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;13:45&lt;/em&gt; - After an extracted wander through residential Kaédi, I arrive at the garage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;13:50&lt;/em&gt; - After a bit of wandering and several not especially helpful guides, I arrive at the spot where one catches a car for Nouakchott. There are only one woman and the ticket seller there. This is troubling since there have to be ten people in the car, including the driver, before we will leave.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;15:00&lt;/em&gt; - I get a text message from Dara and tell her I&apos;m still sitting at the garage and she comes by and gives me a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kelloggs.com/brand/rk/&quot;&gt;Rice Krispies Treat&lt;/a&gt; from a care package. I am quite pleased even though I have to wait til sundown to eat it. (It being Ramadan and people would likely lynch me.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;15:45&lt;/em&gt; - The afternoon crowd starts to wander in and we have a carfull in fairly short order.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;16:15&lt;/em&gt; - The car packs up and we are off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;16:30&lt;/em&gt; - We make it to the main crossroads headed out of town and the driver stops and tells us to get out. He then drives off with all of our stuff. I sincerely hope he is coming back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;16:45&lt;/em&gt; - The driver comes back, packs us back in the car and takes us back to the garage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;17:00&lt;/em&gt; - Classic Mauritanian clusterfuck ensues. Ten guys or so standing around in a circle yelling at each other. Random people will wander by and stop and take part in the yelling. The driver is pissed about something. It is all in Hassaniya, so I really don&apos;t know what. Just for flair one guy has a police whistle and keeps blowing it at random intervals even though no one is paying him any heed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;17:15&lt;/em&gt; - Eventually they get fed up with the driver and pack us into a new car.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;17:25&lt;/em&gt; - We are off once again. Apparently for real this time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;18:00&lt;/em&gt; - We pass corn fields which are nothing other than some stalks covered in locusts. The road is covered with bands of them which take off and smack the windshield with dull thuds as we pass.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;18:15&lt;/em&gt; - We pass a fellow herding a bunch of cows. The interesting aspect was he was doing it on camelback. How he managed to do anything from the back of one of those ungainly beasts is beyond me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;18:30&lt;/em&gt; - The sun goes down and we break fast in the car with some water and dates. They don&apos;t offer me anything which is disappointing since I&apos;ve not eaten anything but some olives and eggs all day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;19:00&lt;/em&gt; - We stop in a town for dinner and tea. I don&apos;t know how this process works, so I am sort of sitting off to the side when someone yells &quot;Toubab, mangez&quot; (&quot;White guy, eat&quot;) and I oblige. We have the usual communal plate with some meat and gravy with bread.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;21:00&lt;/em&gt; - We get a flat and all trundle out of the car to wait for it to be fixed. As long as we are stopped everyone other than me takes the opportunity to pray.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;23:00&lt;/em&gt; - As we pass near towns I start getting SMS messages saying election returns are coming in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;1:00&lt;/em&gt; - We pull into the garage in Nouakchott and I head straight to &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminati.stderr.org/pipermail/jsfromtherim/2004-November/000315.html&quot;&gt;Obie&apos;s election party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 11 hours to make it about 450km. It could certainly have been worse. We did only have one flat. Our driver didn&apos;t replace the spare, so that is particularly fortuitous.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Mayo</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I may well be the least healthy person ever (barring all you dumbasses who smoke). I have been progressively working my way through a 32oz jar of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.luzianne.com/template_category.cfm?ID=6&quot;&gt;Blue Plate&lt;/a&gt; mayonnaise I bought in Mali. This is some tasty stuff. Steph and I used to buy it in Huntsville. It is, of course, mayonnaise though; aka. congealed vegetable oil and eggs. Probably the only thing less healthy that I could make a major part of my diet would be lead paint chips or strychnine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damnation it tastes good though. In an effort to make the most of my limited condiments, I attempted to spice up a kebab sandwich last night. A kebab is a piece of &quot;pain arabe&quot; (pretty much pita bread) with french fries, ketchup, mayo and some grilled ground meat (probably goat) on it. They are pretty good and especially so at 200um apiece. I can&apos;t make soup from a mix at that price. The inclusion of some bonus mayo was a given and I also had a jar of raspberry jam I lifted from Obie&apos;s. I mixed the two together and came out with this nice creamy fruit concoction. This went surprisingly well with the sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the end I had a ton of mayo combined with some red meat, french fries, jam and bread. I am &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; not going to be speaking English &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/~ivankara/5513.html&quot;&gt;during WAIST&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<subject>re: mayo</subject>
				<body>You need to try this. It is yummy.

32oz is a huge quantity of mayo, especially for one person to eat. The jar weighs a couple of pounds. I&apos;ve been exploring the splendor that is Blue Plate extensively.

A really good recipe that a bunch of us did was 2 cans stewed tomatoes, 2 cans tomato paste, 1 leg of goat boiled, chopped and sautéd with 3 onions and 2 cloves of garlic, and about 5 tablespoons of mayo. This made a nice creamy stroganoff sort of sauce that we ate on spaghetti. You may have to substitute for the goat leg. &amp;#x263A;

I&apos;ve never been able to match the tastiness that was nearly expired Kroger meat Fridays at 3&amp;amp;D, but I&apos;ve been trying. I&apos;m turkey hunting currently. They&apos;ve got them in Senegal and Mali, but the closest I&apos;ve been able to come here is a guinea fowl. I&apos;m gonna keep hunting though. Thanksgiving last year was chicken and that&apos;s just not right.</body>

				<body>mmmmm... kebabs.  you had to order a &quot;kebab royal&quot; to get the french fries thrown in where i was in france, though.  

is harissa common there?  might be a touch healthier than the mayo... and so yummy.

				<subject>re: harissa</subject>
				<body>Sounds intriguing. If it is a relative of mayo I am sure I would like it...

Oh Jesus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://i-cias.com/e.o/harissa.htm&quot;&gt;harissa&lt;/a&gt; is that pepper stuff? That&apos;s no relative of the amicable and pleasing experience that is mayonnaise. I&apos;m sure it is healthier for me, in that I can&apos;t do much more than look at it without bursting into tears. It is great for keeping me on a diet because I can just look longingly at any food that has been tainted with the stuff.

You like that stuff? Did you eat so much of it that it burned your taste buds off? I shouldn&apos;t be so harsh. It might taste really good. I&apos;ve never really been able to get past the pain to tell if it has a flavor apart from burning.</body>

				<body>yup, the spicy stuff  :)  love it.  not in huge amounts, but a little on a kebab royal is great.  then again, i also suffer from a curry addiction... and spicy food is mighty hard to come by in france outside the kebab stands.

i hung out with a fellow exchange student named larissa a lot at the time... it took us like half the year to figure out why people kept dropping the &apos;l&apos; and saying &quot;comme la sauce?&quot; whenever she introduced herself.</body>

Yes, you should not be so harsh. I have seen some of the crap you have eaten and the fact that you are still alive today in spite of it is either a testament to a very strong stomach or unwielding stubbornness. Or possibly both.</body>

				<body>Ok, I swear I did not forget your birthday. We have been on ten hour days the last couple of days at work, with one more to go tomorrow. I thought of it Monday night/Tuesday morning and pondered sending you an early birthday greeting. I considered it lame but then forgot to send you a happy b-day notice on your actual b-day.

Sorry:(

Hope you had a great b-day though:)</body>

			<event>After an enjoyable evening of drunken birthday pool I was not especially quick to haul my butt out of bad this morning. I finally managed to make it conscious around noon and put in a couple hours trying to configure a mail relay at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iset-rosso.mr&quot;&gt;ISET&lt;/a&gt; where I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samba.org&quot;&gt;domain controller&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the week. After all this strenuous intellectual work I switched gears to some manual and moved most of my stuff into the house where I&apos;m staying for a while. The place is really nice. It has a stove and a refrigerator and a hot water heater and a tv. This is a big step up for me since before I had only a mostly broken water heater.

The girl who owns the house is off to Dakar already. I had barely enough time to see her and get the keys before she was out the door. So the place is mine for a while. Well, mine and her cats&apos;&amp;hellip;</event>

			<subject>Gardien</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I spent the night in my new bed last night. It was quite nice. It doesn&apos;t have springs or anything, it is more like a futon mattress. It is a decided step up from the pieces of foam rubber I&apos;ve been sleeping on for the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday one of the British volunteers came by and dropped some clothes off that my roommate said he could have washed. He started but didn&apos;t finish and left saying that he was told the guardian would finish the work. I went out last night and didn&apos;t get around to talking to the guardian, so it wasn&apos;t until this morning that I discovered that he and I share an unfortunate characteristic: neither one of us can speak French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sentence was chock full of those damned articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;background-color: rgb(240, 197, 239); color: black&quot;&gt;&quot;He told me that Miranda told him that you could finish the washing. Is that true?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;background-color: rgb(139, 199, 255); color: black&quot;&gt;&quot;Il m&apos;a dit que Miranda l&apos;a dit que vous pouvez finir le lavage. N&apos;est pas?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m pretty sure that is at least in the neighborhood of what it is supposed to be. I was at this point gesticulating with a bag of clothes so you&apos;d think that would have given at least some slight contextual clues. I got nothing though. Not even a confused look. He was completely blank as though I wasn&apos;t standing in front of him at all. I wondered for a moment if perhaps my French was so atrocious as that the hearing of it had damaged his brain in some way. Or perhaps that God had annihilated me for sins against the French language and I was being left &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0038650/&quot;&gt;George Bailey&lt;/a&gt; style to see a world without me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a second attempt he decided that he couldn&apos;t will me out of existence and so took the clothes from me. I wandered back to my room not necessarily feeling as though I&apos;d communicated anything, but simply that I&apos;d laid some good groundwork for culpable deniability later when the bloke&apos;s clothes weren&apos;t washed. &quot;What?&quot; I&apos;d say, &quot;I gave him the clothes and told him that you said to wash them. I thought he understood me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I wasn&apos;t to get off that easily. A few minutes later when I was getting ready to get in the shower he called me back out to the washing machine. (She&apos;s got a washing machine!) He points to the clothes which are now lying in a little pile in front of the machine. &quot;You use that,&quot; he says. I don&apos;t especially like washing my own clothes let alone a relative stranger&apos;s. So I respond, &quot;I thought you were going to do it.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; he responds and I scurry off before he can rebut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I come back out I note that the clothes are now gone and the machine is empty. Wondering what is going on I find him out in the storage room filling a wash tub with water. &quot;That&apos;s not necessary,&quot; I say to him, &quot;you can use the machine.&quot; &quot;We are going to use the machine?&quot; he questions. &quot;Yes,&quot; I respond, pleased at this usage of &quot;we&quot; by which I mean &quot;him.&quot; So he comes back in and puts the clothes in front of the machine and looks questioningly at me before copying my earlier of ploy of running away before the other party can compose a proper argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well played,&quot; I think to myself. So I stuff some clothes in the machine. A good minute and a half of work that I invested fifteen trying to avoid and I call the British lad to tell him that he&apos;ll have to come and deal with his clothes because I am unable to communicate even the most rudimentary of concepts in French.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Moon Tower</subject>
			<event>I&apos;ve never seen it, but apparently the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106677/&quot;&gt;Dazed and Confused&lt;/a&gt; has a scene where a party is held at a tower dubbed the &quot;moon tower.&quot; I have a friend who really liked the idea of life imitating art and so decided that we ought to find something tall to climb and get high on.

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Finding a moon tower&quot;&gt;

The other night was the nineteenth birthday party for one of the British boys (their organisation does their service before college). After a couple hours of drinking the group was sufficiently liquored up to go run amok for a bit. It was decided to sneak into the stadium and climb one of the lights. These lights are somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 feet high and are literally the tallest things in the city other than a new building going in for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.woodside.com.au/&quot;&gt;oil company&lt;/a&gt; and maybe a couple of phone towers.

The task was not terribly daunting for the most part. As we were walking in we risked waking one of the guardians who sleep on the premises, but if we did all they could really do is kick us out. The dangerous bit was after we were in the stade proper. The construction is something I&apos;ve seen in Europe, but never in the States. The stands are accessible from the outside of the building, but not from the field. The only way to the field from the stands is a drop of about twelve feet. We muddled over this problem for a bit before shimmying down a water pipe that thankfully stayed attached to the wall. At this point we couldn&apos;t really say we just were wandering around, so this was the part where getting caught would have been bad.

Fortunately we awoke no one and our climb up the hundreds of rungs to the top of the tower was similarly uneventful. There are three poles holding the lights up and the ladders are on the inside with platforms every twenty feet or so. Falling at most places would likely have broken some bones but unless you caught your head probably wouldn&apos;t have killed you. Toward the top we had a few places that were toward the outside of the structure that were a bit scary, but remained uneventful.

Once we arrived we sat around and didn&apos;t smoke any illicit substances because that is wrong. Instead we just admired the view of Nouakchott at night and enjoyed the natural high of doing illegal things. We hung out talking til about 4am which was the British boy&apos;s birthday and wished him a nineteenth year that could measure up to this grand commencement. We then descended and headed home for a well deserved rest.

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;</event>

			<subject>Bad Days</subject>
			<event>I generally am a cheerful person. Well, perhaps not cheerful, content at least. I generally like my life and the things I do with it. I&apos;ve heard of &quot;bad days&quot; where you are in a funk and just generally feel unhappy. I&apos;m having something like one of those. Rather than feeling unhappy though I am just getting really irritated at the stupidity of everyone around me. Granted, this is a special sense of &quot;stupidity,&quot; meaning &quot;not thinking like I think they should,&quot; but that&apos;s pretty much the same thing.

I think me having left work at almost midnight and not having gotten to sleep until 1:30 only to be woken up at 8am to have French crammed in my head didn&apos;t help put my in an especially accommodating mood.

There&apos;s just so much going on right now. So many people have projects going on and want my help. There is a shortage of tech people here and definitely a shortage of people willing to work. So I always seem to be behind on work for someone. I think I can hold out for another week or so and try and get some stuff wrapped up, then I&apos;m sneaking off for a break. &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminati.stderr.org/pipermail/jsfromtherim/2004-November/000318.html&quot;&gt;Classes&lt;/a&gt; are started though and that&apos;s good.

I&apos;ve also probably been infected by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somethingpositive.net&quot;&gt;Something Positive&lt;/a&gt; which I discovered and read about a year&apos;s worth of yesterday while waiting on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.partimage.org&quot;&gt;ghosting process&lt;/a&gt;. Entertaining it is; chipper it is not.

			<subject>CDs</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;This is just a random note if any of those of you who read this are geeky types. Really geeky types...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is if you are the sort who would ever download and run software off the internet. Now, I am certainly not, I just pop off to my local EB and buy whatever I need. It is a four hour long plane flight, but it gives me the solace of knowing all my software is legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this friend though and much as I have tried to correct his wayward ways he continues to use those evil &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shareaza.com&quot;&gt;P2P&lt;/a&gt; filesharing programs. He has been having trouble with stuff he downloaded though and I decided to help him even though it would taint my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;250% of Your USRDA of Geekiness&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was downloading cd images that should, in principle, be ready to burn onto a cd. When he tried though they wouldn&apos;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a Linux system if a file is a valid ISO9660 image, you should be able to mount it on the loopback with the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mount -o loop &lt;em&gt;filename&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;mount_point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn&apos;t working out though. Upon running the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hexdump &lt;em&gt;filename&lt;/em&gt; | head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got output which looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;0000000 ff00 ffff ffff ffff ffff 00ff 0200 0100
0000010 5245 0002 0b00 da0a 0100 0100 0000 0000
0000020 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
*
0000210 4d50 0000 0000 0200 0000 0100 0000 0200
0000220 524d 534b 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000230 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you&apos;ve ever looked at an ISO image, you know that the whole first bit of the thing is 0&apos;s (like the first several thousand bytes). That this one starts with data means something is amiss. So, I went searching the internet for info on CDs and found that another common format for CD images is a straight binary copy of the disk. ISO images are fine, but they can only represent a single ISO filesystem. There are miltisession discs with multiple filesystems, or more frequently with games, a data track and then audio tracks. A straight binary copy simply gets all the data on the disk and then often relies on an external file to say where exactly the different tracks begin on the disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CD-ROMs are not as infallable of devices as one might think. It turns out that getting a disk spinning thousands of times a second and then hitting an exact spot with a laser is sort of difficult. This is the reason that you have problems with buffer under-runs with CD-Rs. Data has to be fed continually to the burner so that the laser can be kept on. If the laser is turned off the drive isn&apos;t precise enough to start back up just where it left off, so voila, coaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same problem exists when the drive is just reading normally. To counter it and allow the drive to properly find its position, there is extra data written to the disk to counter &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq02.html#S2-15&quot;&gt;jitter&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; Those first bytes you can see in the hexdump are those &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq02.html#S2-43-4&quot;&gt;jitter correction bits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend had somehow gotten his hands on a binary image incorrectly labeled as an ISO filesystem image. This leaves me with a couple choices. I am burning under &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linux.org&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;http://freshmeat.net/projects/cdrecord/&quot;&gt;cdrecord&lt;/a&gt; which has a &lt;code&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; option that should permit me to write this image straight to disk. As it is though I know that the disk has only a single data track and I would like to be able to mount it on the loopback. Also, since there are an extra 304 bytes for every 2048 bytes of user data, so there is about 15% unnecessary info in the image. I had to delete stuff just to get this image onto my machine, so for a couple 700mb images, that 200mb of wasted space is something I&apos;d like to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, my friend doesn&apos;t have the index file. Fortunately though for a single data track, creating one is trivial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;FILE &quot;cdimage.bin&quot; BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other modes were possible, but mode 1 is the most common. Just to verify though, checked what data was present at what would be the end of the track if it was being written in mode 1. I have to skip the 16 byte header and then the 2048 bytes of user data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hexdump -s $((16+2048)) -n 288 &lt;em&gt;filename&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;0000810 13c5 2b68 0000 0000 0000 0000 f700 f500
0000820 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
*
0000860 0000 0000 0000 3552 7db8 0000 0000 0000
0000870 0000 f500 f400 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000880 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
*&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this is checksum stuff, but bytes 5-12 should be 0s and they are. One more check is to see if the position that should be the start of the next track is one of those syncronizing frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hexdump -s 2352 -n 16 &lt;em&gt;filename&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;0000930 ff00 ffff ffff ffff ffff 00ff 0200 0101&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough it is. So, all I do now, knowing that I&apos;ve got the right format is run the image through a program to strip off those checksums and synchronization bits called &lt;a href=&quot;http://he.fi/bchunk/&quot;&gt;binchunker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bchunk &lt;em&gt;img_filename&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;index_filename&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;output_filename&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I now have a nice little ISO image that I can mount and burn no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

			<subject>Horrorscopes</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;After a very long night followed by an even longer day, I am completely without sleep. The latest edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/nouakchott_notes/&quot;&gt;Nouakchott Notes&lt;/a&gt; is done. Unfortunately, sometimes the holy grail of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peacecorps.gov&quot;&gt;Peace Corps&lt;/a&gt; privacy information, site assignments, are mentioned therein, and so I can&apos;t put them on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did excerpt and HTMLize a bit of it though to give you a sample: &lt;a href=&quot;http://will.mr.pcvs.org/december_2004_horrorscopes.html&quot;&gt;the horoscopes&lt;/a&gt;. We&apos;ve got serious stuff too. I think I could do the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tourismtunisia.com/&quot;&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; travel article without giving terrorists any clues as to how to find and kill volunteers. That would be doubly good, since I&apos;m trying to get my mom to go there with me in May.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Livres Partout</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m in the process of getting all my stuff put away having been evicted about a week ago. I got about a week and a half notice in a town where the average time it takes to find a house is measured in months. Fortunately, I had a friend who was kind enough to put me up and not charge me too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only own two things: clothes and books. Actually I don&apos;t even really own the books, I&apos;m just borrowing them from the Peace Corps libraries. Anyhow, I&apos;ve been sorting through the piles of books that have been collecting as I read. A while back, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mollytania.diaryland.com/&quot;&gt;Molly&lt;/a&gt; sent me a lovely collection of books that I&apos;ve been working though for the last couple months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of hefty lifting in there. Molly is a philosophy major and one of the sharper witted people I&apos;ve met. We&apos;ve had a tiff that both of us still believe ourselves to be in the right on and it casts an unfortunate shadow over our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I enjoyed the present quite a bit and decided to respond in kind by sending her the favorites out of the collection I am cleaning out of my house. There&apos;s something special in giving good books to a reader. I know how much I liked reading them and to know that she more than likely will get a kick out of them entertains me. Maybe she&apos;ll come into town for Christmas and I can get them to her then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, my selections are much more anecdotal. As much as I enjoy a good argument I love a good story more.&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>have you found that english language books have a special kick when you&apos;re living in not-english?  i can remember how each english novel we had in france made the rounds of all the american exchange students, and i&apos;m still half-convinced that every author i read while there, from salman rushdie to helen fielding, is a super-special artistic genius... suppose part of it&apos;s withdrawl from the ability to express complex ideas.</body>

			<subject>Ma Premiere Quiz</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I&apos;ve ever quizzed. I was taken with &lt;a href=&quot;http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=382&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which I saw in &lt;lj user=&quot;rumielf&quot;&gt;&apos;s journal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You scored as &lt;b&gt;Chaotic Good&lt;/b&gt;. A Chaotic Good person is someone who has little intrinsic respect for laws or authority, seeing them as insufficient to sustain what&apos;s right. These people work according to their own moral compass which, while good, is not necessarily always aligned with that of society.  Despite their chaotic tendencies, these people are good at heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Chaotic Good&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; width: 75%; background-color: gray; height: 4px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;75%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Lawful Good&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; width: 60%; background-color: gray; height: 4px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;60%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Neutral Good&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; width: 60%; background-color: gray; height: 4px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;60%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;True Neutral&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; width: 60%; background-color: gray; height: 4px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;60%&lt;/td&gt;

			<subject>Drama</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Into every life it seems like a little drama will fall. I got my fill last night with the ending of mine and Dara&apos;s brief relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Dara and I&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first met toward the beginning of September when she was in town on medical hold. We went out walking and chatted and whatnot. We had fun together and I found her spirituality especially interesting. Empathy is a really big part of how I operate and she seemed to have a solid feel for the humanity of the people around her. I was off to Mali for much of September and while I was there I thought about the time I spent with her. I was in the company of another girl who was
interesting to me, but who was proving fairly emotionally unavailable. I was comparing the idea of dating her with the idea of dating Dara and liking Dara more.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Once I got back in Mauritania we started communicating via text messaging. Mostly just silly and sweet things, but a rapport developed through it. For Halloween I went down to Kaédi and we began and consummated a serious relationship then. It was romantic and entertaining. I had some reservations about the differences in our ages (I&apos;m more than two years older than her) and romantic experience, but things looked doable.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;The month and a half since have seen lots of text messages, but only two actual physical meetings. Once when I went down to Kaédi again and then this weekend when she came in to see me.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Our time in Kaédi had strengthened my reservations, but I know that starting out in a relationship can be rough. I figured I&apos;d give it one more go with a clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Things did go somewhat better. For me there are two major parts to a relationship: comfort and passion. Comfort is the ability to go out shopping, cook a meal, and snuggle up under a cover to watch a movie together. It encompasses a basic trust and understanding of the other person&apos;s personality. Passion is the ability to, after the movie, head off to the bedroom and fuck until neither of you can see straight. It encompasses a similarity in arousal and sensuality.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Dara and I were doing well on the sweet comfort sorts of things. We hung out and talked and whatnot. So far as the passion though, I was having some problems. Not that it wasn&apos;t entertaining, but I just didn&apos;t feel right doing it. I knew that it was important to Dara to not just think of herself as fucking around. She wants a long term relationship and I think especially in a sexual relationship it is important.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;It is a very mature way to be. There&apos;s always a real risk of pregnancy and especially if you are firmly against abortion, as she is, you are playing with fire. It is not where I am at though. I&apos;ve got ten months left here and I&apos;m off for God-only-knows-where. I don&apos;t really want to spend those next ten months alone, I&apos;m not looking for anything too serious.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;It was fully my intention for us to break up when I left. I didn&apos;t feel good being physical with her because I knew that she wouldn&apos;t consent if she knew this wasn&apos;t a long term thing.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;I certainly spent a lot of time thinking about whether it was something I ought to worry about at this point. Perhaps I should just leave it til the end. From what I understand of her and what I understand of myself though, this would have just been a lie. I&apos;m eccentric and arrogant. She&apos;s kind and stable. In the long term, I think she&apos;d think me erratic and moody and I&apos;d find her confining. I trust my intuition generally, and I am pretty much certain this was not a relationship for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;So, I dealt with it maturely and decisively. Kinda.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;And by &quot;kinda,&quot; I mean &quot;crappily.&quot; I got quieter and quieter and less and less affectionate. I was spending a lot of time thinking to myself and hedging around the issue with questions. I still kept wondering if maybe it was something that would resolve itself and if I was being to dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about the long term and how reasonable it was to project about it. In that line of thought, these were the questions:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;th style=&quot;border-right: thin solid gray; border-bottom: thin solid gray&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center; border-right: thin solid gray; border-bottom: thin solid gray&quot;&gt;What do you seek with your life?&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Passion&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Adventurous&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border-right: thin solid gray; border-bottom: thin solid gray&quot;&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Intelligent&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Honest&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Deep&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Finally on the night before she was going to leave, I decided to leave it up to her. It was the right thing to do even though I was pretty sure how things would go down and I definitely didn&apos;t want to say what I knew would be something unpleasant to hear. It was dishonest not to tell her though and I couldn&apos;t not. Keeping the secret was leaving me pensive and moody and generally a bad boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;So, I told her and she packed up and left. I admired her for doing what was the right thing for her self-respect even though it was painful for the both of us. It was a surreal experience because it was all in silence. She got up, got ready, packed her stuff and I walked her out. From her getting up to her walking out the door, the last fifteen minutes she was in my house, not a word was said. I just didn&apos;t know what to say. There was nothing to be said other than &quot;I&apos;m sorry&quot; and even that felt too trite.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;After she left, I called Molly who was staying at the Arc en Ciel where I assumed Dara would go. I wanted to wake her up (since it was about 1am) and also to let her know to be ready to be supportive. Disturbingly, I got a message from her about a half hour later that Dara had never arrived and that she wasn&apos;t answering calls.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Dara and I hadn&apos;t said anything at all as she was leaving, let alone where she was going. I assumed she was headed to the hotel since there really aren&apos;t that many options. Nouakchott isn&apos;t a really dangerous city and we&apos;ve probably got a lower crime rate than any city of a comparable size in the States. Crime does exist though and we have had volunteers assaulted here before.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;I tried sending Dara some text messages and got no response. I went out and walked around the restaurants near my house to see if perhaps she had decided to grab a bite to eat (though it had been nearly an hour since she left at this point). Finding that she wasn&apos;t there I widened my search and eventually rode over to the Peace Corps bureau to see if she had ended up there. Thankfully, she was signed into the log and so I headed home.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I started getting text messages forwarded to me that I had sent to her over the course of our relationship&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;On my plans for Halloween:&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;blockquote&gt;GRE is the 23rd. The plan is take the test, run to Senegal for booze, catch the shuttle down, get drunk w Mark, make out w you, dance my ass off &amp;amp; watch porn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;On life:&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is.&quot; -Einstein&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Been fixin&apos; computers. Am still a little ill, but improving. You have no idea how much I&apos;d prefer to be lying in bed w you than dealing w these damned computers&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;On her education in degradation:&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has begun. :) Oh, the places we will go...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;From an evening out:&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I send messages highlighting our separation, does it make you sad? The focus does me a bit, but I&apos;m drunk, so it ain&apos;t that bad. Wish you were here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;I knew she wasn&apos;t dead at this point and I&apos;m assuming she was highlighting the abruptness of our transition. All of these messages though were for more than three weeks in advance. If anything, they were to me a statement as to how my behavior had been changing. I like the guy who sent those messages; he was present and involved. He wasn&apos;t being dramatic or worrying with guilt. Unfortunately, that guy wasn&apos;t who I was being and that was the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;</event>

			<subject>Jesus H. Fucking Christ</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I am too old for this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dara Evans: 2004/12/19 14:01:&lt;/em&gt; I am 2 days late, which is rare. Lets not panic, but all I can think is we could have fucked up the rest of our lives. I will keep u informed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which I had that special kind of fear that only goes along with the possibilities of seeing all your dreams for the future grabbed and shaken. I want to have kids at some point, sure. I&apos;d rather do it with someone that I hadn&apos;t broken up with and who I could see myself marrying. I also want to go to grad school and become a teacher. All that changes if I have to go get a job and start providing for a kid. Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been trying to keep relatively calm. I&apos;ve not been worrying about Dara much at all. I did though, a little bit ago just send a message to make sure everything was still that same and that she was doing alright. My message was &quot;Everything the same? This certainly is stressful. You alright?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dara Evans: 2004/12/19 22:11:&lt;/em&gt; Don&apos;t freak. U r making me nervous. No, nothing. I will text u pronto, promise. Im ok. Trying not to think about it &amp;amp; thinking that if this ok, i&apos;ll not have sex again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully she has better bargaining power with God than I do. This breakup burned off any good karma I had.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Four days with no news. This is bad bad stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dara Evans: 2004/12/19 23:00:&lt;/em&gt; Fuck, what do we do if this is real? Can I heandle this? What will my family say? &amp;amp; my friends? All I can do is sit here &amp;amp; pray its a false alarm.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response was simply that the opinions of other people are the least of our worries. Getting jobs, becoming adults, the end of the dreams of youth are what are scaring the hell out of me. If other people don&apos;t like it, fuck them and the horse they rode in on.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Appétits</subject>
			<event>I&apos;ve been spending a couple days with groups of new people and, as always, thinking both about them and myself and what I&apos;m looking for in the people I spend my time with.

A big thing for me right now is appetite. People hunger for different things; food, affection, intoxication, excitement, sex, whatever... I&apos;m finding that I most enjoy spending time with people who are involved with their appetites; sensual people.

My test generally is getting someone to describe eating big slice of &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/images?q=chocolate cake&quot;&gt;chocolate cake&lt;/a&gt;. There are some people for whom this is not a good measure. Some poor wretches are cursed with an allergy to chocolate; they are to be pitied. Unlike the Godless communists who simply don&apos;t like the stuff; they are to be constantly watched, especially around valuables and children. It is well known that the only thing that the only thing that can turn a person off chocolate is a taste for baby flesh. Often these are charming and charismatic people; frequently this is a part of the package deal they worked out with Satan. Don&apos;t be fooled however, their disdain for God&apos;s true food reveals the blackness of their hearts.

For normal people though, chocolate cake is a good benchmark. As I was saying, most everyone likes it. Not a whole lot of people really savor it though. If you&apos;re someone who has a moment where you can&apos;t speak after you stick that first bite in your mouth because your brain is too busy being happy, then I&apos;m talking about you.

The distinction is one of type as much as degree. It is the difference between one who experiences versus one who is consumed by the experience. I really like that consumption and find it much easier to do when I&apos;m around people who understand that drive.

You can see it on the dance floor too. Just watch people&apos;s faces and shoulders. You can see how much tension they are holding and how much they are aware of the other people who are on the dance floor. To my mind there is a certain confidence required for someone to be sure enough of themselves to exercise a little abandon. I can certainly say that my ability to let go in public has increased as my concern about public opinion has wanned.

I&apos;m not really sure yet if this is a personality thing or a confidence thing or some of both. I&apos;m definitely happier when I&apos;m being consumed by my passions, but perhaps there are those who weren&apos;t meant to live like that. Not really sure...</event>

				<body>Thank ye kindly. You can see from the shots that I&apos;ve taken to wearing a bandanna since my hair is almost to my shoulders now. It has been a year since I&apos;ve cut it and I&apos;ve got about a month until WAIST when I plan on chopping it off unless it gets considerably more easy to manage in the interim.</body>

			<subject>Karaoke</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve got &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/firewall_setup/&quot;&gt;several projects&lt;/a&gt; ongoing and in class productive procrastinator style, I&apos;ve spent much of today learning about something completely unrelated to any of my existing projects: karaoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new group will be having their Early Term Reconnect in a bit and we, the old ones, would like to show them a good time while they&apos;re in town. I personally have an interest in seeing some debauchery after the relative calmness of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcvalentin.smugmug.com/gallery/326987&quot;&gt;Halloween party&lt;/a&gt;. It was entertaining, mind you, but I didn&apos;t quite get it together&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some entertaining suggestions in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bissap (Hibiscus) Wine &amp;bull; obligatory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Baby Oil Wrestling &amp;bull; interesting if the raw materials can be collected&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karaoke &amp;bull; why get people drunk without giving them a chance to make fools of themselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is on this last that I have been researching today. When you go into a karaoke bar the discs that the DJ is playing are in &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbum.com/cdg_revealed.html&quot;&gt;CD+G&lt;/a&gt; format. This is just an extension to the normal audio CD specification that takes previously unused bits and uses them to store graphics information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, who wishes to transport and play karaoke, this presents two issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audio CD&apos;s are recorded with uncompressed 44.1kHz waveforms which occupy about 10mb for each minute of music. (44100 samples/second * 2 bytes/sample * 60 seconds/minute * 1 kilobyte / 1024 bytes * 1 megabyte / 1024 kilobytes ~ 5 megabytes/minute for each sample and there are two channels sampled, bringing it to 10mb/min) This obviously less attractive than modern music formats such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/amm/techinf/layer3/&quot;&gt;mpeg layer 3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vorbis.com&quot;&gt;ogg vorbis&lt;/a&gt; which are generally less than 1mb per minute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The unused bits are the R-W subchannels. The subchannels (P and Q) are used for timing information and for many CD players, it is not possible to access the subchannel information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other complaint about the CD+G format is that it is graphical. The information that is being stored has semantic information (the words that comprise the lyrics) that is lost in the conversion to CD+G. I think that for their audience and the timeframe when it was being released it was the right decision. For my purposes and lack of a need for backward compatibility, I would rather have something that left the lyrics as text rather than rasterizing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my time restraints though, I am just going to see what solutions exist for dealing with the first two issues since dealing with the third is interesting, but far more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially the +G is just a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://members.aol.com/royalef/gifabout.htm&quot;&gt;animated gif&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like programs exist for extracting that info and maintaining the timing. That file then can then be played in sync with the music. This allows both the transportation of the lyrics and the compression of the music.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>GRE</subject>
			<event>Well, the GRE people tell me they mailed my scores on December 11th. That makes it a month since they were mailed. The other people who had their scores sent to Nouakchott got theirs, but nothing for me yet.

They said nothing about me being disqualified for illegal pen usage though, which is what had me worried. They&apos;ve also sent a second copy which will hopefully not meet the same fate as it&apos;s predecessor.

Now, I wait&amp;hellip;</event>

			<event>Well, I got them. Not as good as I had hoped. A solid dose of mediocrity.

The verbal is alright at 680. That is 95th percentile. Sure wish that I was going into a field where strong verbal ability was especially useful.

The quantitative at 750 is in the 79th percentile. This is the one that matters unfortunately. Mean quantitative score for engineering is 721. This means I did better than average for the group I&apos;ll be competing in, but not significantly. I certainly don&apos;t feel good about it.

They sent me a paper that says the mean score is 598 and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StandardDeviation.html&quot;&gt;standard deviation&lt;/a&gt; 148, so at least I made it one interval (1.027&amp;#x3C3;) off the mean. I don&apos;t really understand this. For a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html&quot;&gt;normal distribution&lt;/a&gt;, 68% of the population is within &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConfidenceInterval.html&quot;&gt;one standard deviation&lt;/a&gt; of the mean, right? So, If I am more than one standard deviation from the mean, wouldn&apos;t I need to be in more than the 84th percentile? Surely the GRE is normal, right? Maybe the printout has old numbers on it, or perhaps, as the scores suggest, I can&apos;t do math.

Anyhow, my analytical writing score was 4.5/6 which is 52nd percentile. I just think that&apos;s crap. My arguments and construction were better than 52nd percentile. Granted, the gradation of the scale is pretty broad, but I really think that I did better than that. You all can comprehend my writing, right? I recognize that I have a certain penchant for convoluted sentence structure, but I don&apos;t think that it often clouds my meaning. Am I wrong?

I&apos;m really not sure what to do. These aren&apos;t bad, but they&apos;re not as good as I had hoped. I wonder if I send Berkeley my info and ask them if I have a shot if they&apos;d respond. Is that unprofessional?</event>

				<subject>Don&apos;t feel too bad :)</subject>
				<body>Ah, I&apos;m not sure anyone cares about the stupid writing thing anyway. Reading the descriptions of the differences seemed a bit... arbitrary to me. FYI, I got a 600 verbal, 760 quant, and 5/6 on the writing. 

Apparently, foreign students sometimes memorize word lists and get an 800 on the verbal without speaking a lick of English, and thus, the reason foreign students have to take the TOEFL(Test of English as a Foreign Language). My only comment is that if memorizing a word list can get you an 800 on a &quot;verbal&quot; test in a language you don&apos;t know, I must question its ability to accurately discern any verbal skill at all.

On an aside, getting to know people is as helpful on getting into a school as anything. At least that&apos;s the theory I&apos;m working on. I&apos;m actually going to start posting to my blog soon, and I&apos;ll journal some about what I&apos;m doing. Of course, I&apos;m going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nepls.org/&quot;&gt;NEPLS&lt;/a&gt; next month, and will hopefully get to meet some profs and I&apos;ll let you know how that goes. We&apos;re also going to be doing a Programming Languages reading group up here, and if you want I&apos;ll send you the papers and let you read along if you want :).

				<body>I think you should send them wherever you want. I think that&apos;s good enough. But I would wait. The scores get you in the door, but apparently there are some parts of the process that involve interviews, and I would say when you get back, trips to conferences and such that will make a huge difference. There&apos;s not a whole lot of room for improvement really.

Oh yeah, your statement of purpose(an essay) on your application will probably make a bigger difference than that retarded analytical writing section.</body>

			<subject>Winders</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I have occasionally irreverently joked that I am going to hell for my heathen ways. The scene I describe is a dank cavern with brimstone laden smoke hanging heavy in the air and a bright burning coal for my seat. Recent events have left me revising this picture of damnation. I&apos;m pretty sure that hell looks like a large company running a Windows domain that I am responsible for maintaining. There are no hot coals or demons with pincers because the physical pain would only serve to distract me from the true horror that is a Windows network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of students in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisco-academy.mr&quot;&gt;my class&lt;/a&gt; work for a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bsdassocies.mr&quot;&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt; which is having trouble with its domain. When they asked me to come have a look at it, I managed to swallow back the bile that rose in my throat and agreed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;BSD&apos;s Domain&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was relatively simple in description. They were trying to connect to shared folders on the workstations and were being denied. This is one of those relatively simple things that can break down in the oddest ways. Usually you just right click on the folder you want to share, configure the sharing and away you go. This time it was saying that access was denied even though the configuration was right. I found an interesting issue in the group policy editor (&lt;code&gt;gpedit.msc&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a setting in the group policy as to who is allowed to connect to the computer. It was blank and so I tried setting it to &quot;Tout le Monde&quot; (since this is all in French). After about two minutes, if I restarted the policy editor, the entry would be blank again. In the security editor I turned on all the auditing I could, but nothing was getting reported when the operating system was blithely throwing away my configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is exactly this which pisses me off. Despite my harsh words, I am not a blind anti-Microsoft bigot. I do respect that as an operating system it still beats Linux in ease of use. It lies somewhere between Linux and Apple in the &quot;I know better than you do&quot; schools of operating system design. It generally tries to keep you from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/joke/foot.htm&quot;&gt;shooting yourself in the foot&lt;/a&gt;, but often keeps you from putting your shoes on as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of situation is the most irritating. Where it is changing stuff not only without asking me, but also without telling me why. Again, this is a useful feature for grandmas and a royal pain in the ass for me who likes knowing what the hell my computer is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of Windows monolithic architecture is I can change settings for bunches of things (from networking to appearance to webbrowser) all in one place. Specifically, when I have a domain I can have those settings come from the domain controller so that all the systems on my domain are configured the same way. A useful idea and I was thinking that perhaps this setting was disappearing because an overriding setting was coming from the domain controller. The command &lt;code&gt;gpresult&lt;/code&gt; showed that there was a policy for the domain. The controller said that its settings were not affecting that setting, but I disabled the policy just to be safe. Running &lt;code&gt;gpupdate&lt;/code&gt; on the client didn&apos;t get to stop saying it was getting a policy from the controller, but a restart did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This did not fix the problem unfortunately. The setting seemed not to be disappearing, but I still couldn&apos;t connect. Some further mucking revealed that there was a separate setting for who was to be denied access and this was also set to &quot;Tout le Monde.&quot; I took that out and things started working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I wasn&apos;t especially irritated. The lack of telling me what was going on and the apparently misleading report from the domain controller that it wasn&apos;t overriding the setting were tiring, but par for the course. I then headed downstairs and found half a dozen other computers all acting like the one upstairs, but which weren&apos;t responding to the policy change. I mucked about for another hour or so trying various things before giving up and just leaving. It is just so frustrating to not have computers react in a consistent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replaced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iset-rosso.mr&quot;&gt;ISET&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s domain controller with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samba.org&quot;&gt;samba&lt;/a&gt; install a while back. I&apos;m thinking about trying to convince BSD to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 75%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, I have been making progress in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/~ivankara/15161.html&quot;&gt;karaoke hunt&lt;/a&gt;, sorta. I downloaded an archive yesterday with some 27,000 odd &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi&quot;&gt;midi&lt;/a&gt;s in it. The problems are twofold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They&apos;re midis, so they sound like 80&apos;s technopop regardless of the song&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &quot;collection&quot; isn&apos;t so much a collection as a huge jumble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my primary audience is drunk people, I figure intoxication will help reduce how much people care about the first issue. The second though will be exacerbated if no one can find the song they want to sing. To this end I have been doing some work using another of Linux&apos;s great features, the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Shell Scripts&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some basic organization. Some directories existed with the names of artists. The problem was that frequently there were songs by and artist that weren&apos;t in the directory. So, script #1: if a song has an artist name, put it in the directory with that same name. If the directory doesn&apos;t exist, create it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;IFS=&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&quot;; for file in *\ -\ *; do name=&quot;${file% -*}&quot;; [ ! -d &quot;$name&quot; ] &amp;&amp; mkdir &quot;$name&quot;; mv -v &quot;$file&quot; &quot;$name&quot;; done&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also bunches of zip archives, also with the name of directories that already existed. I wanted to get rid of them and put the files in the appropriate place. Script #2: for each zip if there&apos;s a directory which matches the zip name, extract the zip to that directory and then delete the zip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;for file in *.zip; do name=&quot;${file%.zip}&quot;; dir=$(ls -1p | grep -i &quot;$name/&quot;); if [ -d &quot;$dir&quot; ]; then pushd &quot;$dir&quot;; mv -v &quot;../$file&quot; ./; unzip &quot;$file&quot;; rm -fv &quot;$file&quot;; popd; fi; done&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since case matters on a Linux system, there are some directories which differ only in case. I need to go through those and collect the repeats in a single directory. Script #3: if multiple directories differ only in case, move the files from all of them into the first and remove all the empties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;for dir in $(ls -1 | uniq -di); do unset fdir; for sdir in $(ls -1p | grep -i &quot;^$dir/&quot;); do if [ -z &quot;$fdir&quot; ]; then fdir=&quot;$sdir&quot;; else mv -v &quot;$sdir&quot;* &quot;$fdir&quot;; rmdir &quot;$sdir&quot;; fi done; done&lt;/code&gt;

			<subject>Blinken Lights</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Christmas this year from my family was $100 or so credit on my credit card to buy electronics stuff. I really like the idea of making something blinking or moving or both. I understand a lot of the basics of circuits and whatnot, but making that leap from the abstract to the concrete is a major one. So, I am planning on a project that will be touch on my major interests. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blinking Lights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pretty Colors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Motors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lvr.com/usb.htm&quot;&gt;Universal Serial Bus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emanator.demon.co.uk/bigclive/&quot;&gt;Big Clive&apos;s page&lt;/a&gt;, I saw a project to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emanator.demon.co.uk/bigclive/rgb.htm&quot;&gt;arbitrary colors of light&lt;/a&gt; using combinations of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led&quot;&gt;LED&lt;/a&gt;s. I was thinking about doing a room at my families &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/riddlecreek/&quot;&gt;cabin&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thevospad.com&quot;&gt;VOS pad&lt;/a&gt;, so this would be good practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That still leaves off motors. Well, I was thinking that I could strap the light to a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor&quot;&gt;stepper motors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seattlerobotics.org/guide/servos.html&quot;&gt;servos&lt;/a&gt; and make it so I could aim it electronically. I&apos;ve tried doing stuff with motors before and fucked it up, so even though I can&apos;t come up with many places I need to aim a light electronically, I&apos;d like to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That really just leaves USB. I got a little USB frontpanel from &lt;a href=&quot;http://dragons-keep.net/&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; that connected via USB and enjoyed playing with it even though I never did anything especially productive with it. The simplest ways to interface with a computer are via the parallel port, but I&apos;d really like to learn a bit more about USB. I was hunting the web on USB today and noticed that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1335&amp;dDocName=en010168&quot;&gt;PIC16C745&lt;/a&gt; has USB support. I was already planning on using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=74&quot;&gt;PIC&lt;/a&gt; and so I think I&apos;ll just go with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;The Goal&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think getting this project to work would require me to learn a good bit about the electronics that fascinate me so. I&apos;d also have a light that I could hook up at parties or something. Not sure on what exactly I&apos;d do with it yet. The learning is the important bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End the end I want to be able to plug the thing in and then use a program like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Pretty Colors&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 75%;&quot; src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/light_project/ui_mockup.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

				<body>&lt;p&gt;First off, I forgot to mention this to you the other day, but you do know about &quot;sampling&quot; parts right? Most of these companies don&apos;t care about selling 1-2 parts, and most of their customers are professional designers rather than hobbyist, so they will send you &quot;samples&quot; of 1-8 pieces of several parts for pretty much nothing. So to help your money go further, you really need to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another aside, you probably want to be careful of getting surface mount parts if possible. I can&apos;t solder for crap(ask Wayne), but I can get DIP parts on a board without cold solder joints and shorts, but surface mount parts are beyond my skill. Of course, if I had soldering iron that wasn&apos;t crap it would help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the USB support. That&apos;s definitely the way to go for interfacing with PC&apos;s. Parallel ports are simple I admit, but between weird driver stuff, and the fact that everything else is moving to USB, you&apos;re more likely to happy with the &quot;professional&quot; results of using USB. Also, parallel ports can be weird about being bidirectional, and so USB is nice on that front too. The only thing you&apos;ll need to watch out for is that you may draw more power than the USB port can provide, so you&apos;ll want to buffer your USB port, and then provide an external power supply, I think the Microchip data sheet addresses this, and so you should look there. I know LED&apos;s are pretty minimal on power, but motors draw more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, like I said, get a stepper motor control chip like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allelectronics.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=285&amp;item=EDE-1200&amp;type=store&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;(I also like ordering from All Electronics). Make sure the chip matches the polarity and lead count of your motor though. Also, for things like motors that require power, you have to get parts like H-Bridges. An H-Bridge will take a 5V, small amperage logic signal and convert it to a high voltage, high amperage signal capable of powering/driving the motor. The spec/data sheets should have all the info you need, including circuit diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heh, you might want to mix your light controller with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.media.mit.edu/~ladyada/make/minty/index.html&quot;&gt;MP3 player&lt;/a&gt; and make the lights respond to the music. A PIC might not have the processing power to any DSP, but you could probably do some simple stuff, a couple of simple low-pass, mid-pass, and high pass filters could pull out a couple of frequency ranges and cause it respond in some way(maybe the bass signal drive the pitch, mid signal drive the yaw, and the high pitches affect the color?).&lt;/p&gt;</body>

			<subject>Helix</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;FYI, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.e-fense.com/helix/&quot;&gt;Helix&lt;/a&gt; fucking rocks. I was getting ready for class last night where we were supposed to set up a little network between two computers using a crossover cable. You have to be an administrator to do this and as I was getting ready, I discovered that the password had expired on all the administrator accounts. When I tried to change it, it told me that I didn&apos;t have the proper rights. How the hell I, the administrator, don&apos;t have the rights, is beyond me. The philosophical connotations of XP&apos;s vagaries I didn&apos;t have time to contemplate, so I burned a copy of Helix I downloaded a while back figuring I&apos;d give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a chance to show my students some Linux and Helix was great for that. It is all in cool hacker silvers and browns with neon green type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 75%&quot; src=&quot;http://www.e-fense.com/helix/gallery/Fgallery2-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s alpha blending all over the place. It just looks powerful. On startup you can put the system into French, but the French manual pages aren&apos;t installed, so all that is still English. Most of the programs had at least partial translation though which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had one XP box that I could use and I used that as the other end of our little network. Everything went smoothly other than I discovered I suck at making crossover cables. At the end I hooked the machine back up to the rest of the network and ran &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ethereal.com&quot;&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; for a while. It was nice to be able to show them that packets really were bouncing around the network and to explain some of them.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>I am headed off to the stade olympique (built shortly after Mauritania&apos;s recognition by the Olympic committee in 1979) to run stairs. I&apos;ve not run stairs since I was in high school. I&apos;ve not run at all other than a couple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gthhh.com&quot;&gt;Hashes&lt;/a&gt; in the last year and a half. I am going to die&amp;hellip;

I&apos;m still recovering from &lt;a href=&quot;http://geo.ya.com/travelimages/az-adha.html&quot;&gt;tabaski&lt;/a&gt; where I discovered I&apos;ve still not accomplished to make any Mauritanian friends. I had a couple people ask me if I had plans for the day, but got no invites. It is pitiful really; this is the biggest holiday of the year.

I sat around feeling depressed about not having done better in the last year and a half for most of the day. For the night though, the volunteers in Nouakchott headed out to our one dance club. I danced until 5:30am and then slept the whole next day. I&apos;m still not at 100%. I&apos;m getting old.</event>

			<subject>Exporting a Livejournal</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;&lt;lj user=&quot;titivillus&quot;&gt; asked me about something I mentioned about creating a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/a&gt; job to archive &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;livejournal&lt;/a&gt; posts.

			<event>Jesus H. Christ, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisco-academy.mr&quot;&gt;this place&lt;/a&gt; will be the death of me. I saw one of the teachers wandering by today and asked him about his class. There are only two classes going on right now at the academy: one headed by him and the other by me. I&apos;d heard that his students weren&apos;t showing up and I asked him about it. This predicated a bit of grumbling about at most one coming and him being tired, and then a quick &quot;je passe&quot; and he ducked out.

My French teacher (who is also a University English student) happened to be in the room and I asked him what exactly &quot;je passe&quot; meant. I thought maybe it was like &quot;j&apos;arrive&quot; and that he&apos;d be right back. My teacher just said, &quot;I dunno, we don&apos;t say that in French.&quot; Well, in any case, he never came back.

I asked him how many students they had and he told me a &quot;dixane&quot; (about ten). One of his students just wandered by and was saying he comes by for class, but there is never anyone here. I figured I&apos;d see if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cisco.netacad.net&quot;&gt;online system&lt;/a&gt; and see if I could get the email addresses of everyone. I&apos;ll start teaching the class even though I&apos;m not certified to, if it comes to that. It turns out there are only four students. I figure I can keep far enough ahead of them to teach.

I &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; don&apos;t feel like doing this. I currently use Sunday and Monday to handle work for various other projects. Spending them teaching a handful of students information I don&apos;t know well is not what I feel like doing. The Academy is going to fold though, and I&apos;ll feel bad if I didn&apos;t do everything I could to keep it from going under.</event>

				<body>how weird.  for some reason, i&apos;d never differentiated between &quot;dizaine&quot; and &quot;douzaine.&quot;  and hadn&apos;t even thought about the fact that i &quot;knew&quot; two words for a dozen.  and tennish is usually close enough twelvish that i might never have noticed if you hadn&apos;t said something.  cool!

sorry to hear the university&apos;s faltering along like that, though.</body>

			<subject>RAID</subject>
			<event>Dammit all. I am here at ISET working on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html&quot;&gt;IDE RAID&lt;/a&gt;. This system hates me for some reason. I did everything like I thought I was supposed to, but it stoutly refuses to boot from the RAID even though it will work booting from a CD.

Even worse now is the filesystem is completely trashed. When you make a new RAID the system it puts some info at the end of the disk so that it can build the arrays automatically if you like. Well, I like, and so I had it do that. Afterward though, you have to use &lt;code&gt;resize2fs&lt;/code&gt; to shrink the resultant system down a bit. Well, I made my raid and ran the program and it resized the partition to twice what it was before.

You&apos;re thinking you know my error, and that I accidentally did a RAID-0 instead of the RAID-1 I wanted. I didn&apos;t though. I have no idea why it did what it did. When I tried to use &lt;code&gt;e2fsck&lt;/code&gt; to fix it, it was making me hit &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to verify I wanted to continue even though a block was missing. There were about 20,000,000 blocks missing so this wasn&apos;t going to work.

Trying to force &lt;code&gt;resize2fs&lt;/code&gt; to put it back was failing with an error about a bad &quot;block bitmap.&quot; I eventually got desperate and tried &lt;code&gt;mke2fs&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s &lt;code&gt;-S&lt;/code&gt; and that finished killing it completely. Fortunately, I had done a backup using &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; and I&apos;m copying that back now.

I&apos;ve still got no clue, but I&apos;m going to try once more with the RAID just because I refuse to believe this process is that complicated.</event>

			<event>Holy shit. I copied the system back, checked it out and then let the system overwrite my backup space with the RAID. This should have been fine since the RAID should have replaced the backup within minutes. It is now massively massively damaged. Thousands upon thousands of errors. And my backup is gone. This is so unbelievably bad...</event>

			<subject>Shouldn&apos;t Work Ever Ever Ever</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;In the theme of &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0146882/&quot;&gt;High Fidelity&lt;/a&gt; and on the heels of my massive fuck-up last night; here is my top five list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Top Five Reasons I Ought to Be Flipping Burgers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 1em 0em .5em 2em; text-indent: -2em;&quot;&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Sail Automation and Intelligence Laboratory&apos;s Robot Simulator&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; I spent a summer trying to complete &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csc.tntech.edu/~artrent/&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/classes/csc370/370_index.html&quot;&gt;robot work&lt;/a&gt;. I just sort of wandered aimlessly through about a dozen fields I didn&apos;t really know anything about and never actually produced much of anything. Since I felt guilty I gave the department $600 when I got back off of co-op and they bought themselves and air conditioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0em 0em .5em 2em; text-indent: -2em;&quot;&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csc.tntech.edu/~dat/&quot;&gt;Talbert&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s Othello Server&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; After finishing my six and a half years of undergrad, I hung around for a semester to finish up my work on #1 of this list. So that I could stay on as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.tntech.edu/cc/&quot;&gt;helpdesk&lt;/a&gt; employee and because the subject interested me, I signed up for an independent study with Dr. Talbert. My big project was to generalize and document a &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/projects/othello_server/target/docs/othello_protocol.html&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; for managing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattelothello.com&quot;&gt;Othello&lt;/a&gt; playing AIs. I was already completely swamped with #1; ended up doing diddly squat and failed the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0em 0em .5em 2em; text-indent: -2em;&quot;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mil-tec.com&quot;&gt;Miltec&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s Missile Flight Visualizer&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; I worked on systems for visualizing why and how missiles in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.howstuffworks.com/missile-defense.htm&quot;&gt;missile defense system&lt;/a&gt; missed each other. I had a week before a big demo where I was working 12 hour days and finished it up with an nuit blanche. Doing semi-conscious file management is a really bad idea as my &lt;code&gt;rm&amp;nbsp;-rf&amp;nbsp;.&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: blink; background-color: black; color: rgb(206, 207, 189); border: thin solid rgb(255, 222, 178)&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2588;&lt;/span&gt;./backup/&lt;/code&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; showed. The command was taking a really long time to run and I realized what was happening about halfway through. I was actually using &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org/&quot;&gt;subversion&lt;/a&gt;, but the repository was in the directory I mangled. I told them a power failure had damaged my hard drive, which was true, just not the hard drive with the project on it and not at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0em 0em .5em 2em; text-indent: -2em;&quot;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iset-rosso.mr&quot;&gt;ISET&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s IDE RAID&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; This one comes in at #2 because it was so unbelievably irresponsible. I was doing filesystem work on a company&apos;s primary data server without a backup. That&apos;s like blow drying your hair sitting in the tub. You may not fuck up, but you may well and if you do it will likely be catastrophic. I was at ISET til past midnight and back again at 7:30 this morning. I managed to get a good bit of the system back and hopefully the damage was heaviest in the Linux portion and not the user data. The system is up now so people can start discovering if my stupidity deleted all their work. God, that was so fucking dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0em 0em 1em 2em; text-indent: -2em;&quot;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tntech.edu&quot;&gt;Tennessee Tech&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s Education Department&apos;s Portfolio System&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; The winner with a bullet. For a year and a half I was getting paid and meeting with people and setting stuff up all so the education majors at TTU could put submit their projects online and create an electronic portfolio. It was going to be an awesomely complex system which would do everything other than squeeze fresh OJ and give you a blow job. (At least not til version 2.) It ended up as a total wash leaving the education department with nothing but a huge quantity of code using systems that no one there was qualified to maintain. The worst though was me, who snuck off to Africa without so much as a word. At some point I need to give them about $10,000, then we might start to be even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 50%&quot;&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want the unifying theme (other than me), it is simple: &lt;strong&gt;arrogance&lt;/strong&gt;. Well, arrogance and being a chicken shit. I overestimate my abilities, then when I realize I&apos;m going to fuck up, I run away. It is sad really. The only thing that compensates is I really am very good. So long as I&apos;m not given enough rope to hang myself, I can actually be useful. Oh yeah, I also have the attention span of a humming bird on heroin, as my &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org&quot;&gt;project dumpspace&lt;/a&gt; can vouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 50%&quot;&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; For those who don&apos;t speak &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ugu.com&quot;&gt;unix&lt;/a&gt;, that command was supposed to be &lt;code&gt;rm&amp;nbsp;-rf&amp;nbsp;../backup/&lt;/code&gt; or &quot;delete the directory named &apos;backup&apos; and everything in it on level above the current directory in the directory tree.&quot; What I put, &lt;code&gt;rm&amp;nbsp;-rf&amp;nbsp;.&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: blink; background-color: black; color: rgb(206, 207, 189); border: thin solid rgb(255, 222, 178)&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2588;&lt;/span&gt;./backup/&lt;/code&gt;, with the added space, says &quot;delete the current directory and everything in it, also delete the directory &apos;backup&apos; in the current directory.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<subject>You blame yourself too much :)</subject>
				<body>&lt;p&gt;While I do think you&apos;ve made mistakes, since I&apos;ve been around for all of those but #2, I think I&apos;ll give you some counterpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#5. No one was supporting you guys right as near as I could tell. You were a young student, and while you were motivated mostly, they did the whole fire and forget thing and left you hanging. Of course, I also think the research that was going on was a bit shady from the top-level too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#4. Okay. Yeah, you screwed the pooch on that one :). On the other hand, Dr. Talbert gave you an &apos;F&apos; for your efforts, so really its all even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#3. Miltec is almost entirely to blame here. While my coop experience sucked, I had supervision on important stuff, I had peers and senior staff in the area I was working. Miltec needed a programmer and was too retarded to distinguish between &quot;experienced working programmer&quot; and &quot;coop student&quot;, and got exactly what they deserved. You had no senior staff experienced in your coop subject(programming), and so they really should not have hired a coop. I dunno, maybe you disagree, maybe others disagree with me, but they brought you in to do a major project for them as the sole real programmer on staff. That is not a &quot;coop&quot; experience. That is stupid. Oh yeah, the CVS thing was a big bummer, but in the long term its been a good experience, since you now understand in a deep way the concepts of redundant backups, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2. Okay, I dunno. I wasn&apos;t there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1. I class this one in the same category as #3. Stupid. Perhaps less so. I personally think you overcomplicated stuff. I also think they were overambitious, or at least, they should have sought a more gradual introduction of the technology(see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html&quot;&gt;Worse Is Better&lt;/a&gt;). They did not adequately supervise you. While they wanted your program to be easy to use(and could verify that), they should have checked on the administration aspects as well, and while most of them were not qualified, I know that Annette should have weighed in on this. I mean, again, they relied almost entirely on a single student. Maybe I missed something, but any manager who assumes that since their employee is a busy beaver they should just totally leave them alone is not doing their job. Managers are supposed to help keep track of the big picture and know what&apos;s going on. I really don&apos;t think you owe them much of anything. Okay, the sneaking off to Africa is kinda not so good(and since Annette is in ITS now I think it had more than a little to do with your server situation a while back), but the whole thing was a screwup, and I think it had the markings of one for a long time before you went to Africa and they should have seen that. Maybe I missed something here. Yeah, I do agree it is one your more spectacular screwups, and should be #1 on the list, but I&apos;m trying to toss in what&apos;s left of the story :).&lt;/p&gt;</body>

				<subject>Hi</subject>
				<body>I&apos;m on Ktron&apos;s friends list...I&apos;m Alex Brook&apos;s girlfriend, if you know him.  I saw your comments.  More to the point, I saw your icon!   Is it possibly an implication that the current President may, in for years, be replaced by a Senator from New York?  

If so, ROCK ON!

And if so, who made the icon?  May I snag it?

				<body>What an interesting interpretation... Actually, it is far less complex than that. Just ask Alex what my name is. If you&apos;d like to use it with the more complex symbology in mind, I&apos;d be honored. &amp;#x263A;</body>

				<body>Actually, Alex &amp; I already had that discussion, Will.  I felt pretty silly.  I think I&apos;ll leave the icon for you, but you keep it.  Who knows?  In four years you may be able to print it up and sell it as a bumper sticker ;)

			<subject>Jacques Prévert</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I have been flipping through Miranda&apos;s French textbooks in my spare time. I am still enamored with the idea of speaking the language at some point. I ran across some short poems by &lt;a href=&quot;http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A9vert&quot;&gt;Jacques Prévert&lt;/a&gt;. I like them because the French is easy to understand, but sometimes the ideas aren&apos;t. Here&apos;s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; width: 48%&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Pour Toi Mon Amour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Je suis allé au marché aux oiseaux&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em&quot;&gt;Et j&apos;ai acheté des oiseaux&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;Pour toi&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2.1em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot;&gt;mon amour&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Je suis allé au marché aux fleurs&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em&quot;&gt;Et j&apos;ai acheté des fleurs&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;Pour toi&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2.1em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot;&gt;mon amour&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Je suis allé au marché à la ferraille&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em&quot;&gt;Et j&apos;ai acheté des chaînes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.7em&quot;&gt;De lourdes chaînes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;Pour toi&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2.1em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot;&gt;mon amour&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Et puis je suis allé au marche aux esclaves&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em&quot;&gt;Et je t&apos;ai cherché&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: .5em&quot;&gt;Mais je ne t&apos;ai pas trouvé&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot;&gt;mon amour&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; width: 48%&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;For You My Love&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I went to the bird market&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em&quot;&gt;And I bought some birds&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;For you&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2.1em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot;&gt;my love&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I went to the flower market&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em&quot;&gt;And I bought some flowers&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;For you&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2.1em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot;&gt;my love&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I went to the junkyard&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em&quot;&gt;And I bought chains&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.7em&quot;&gt;Heavy chains&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;For you&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2.1em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot;&gt;my love&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;And then I went to the slave market&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em&quot;&gt;And I looked for you&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: .5em&quot;&gt;But I couldn&apos;t find you&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot;&gt;my love&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 75%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I have no idea what that means I bet that if I could say it with a good accent, it would increase my sexiness about 500%. It doesn&apos;t matter that it doesn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense. It just sounds cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m rapidly approaching the point where I&apos;m going to embrace hedonism as my modus vivendi. I&apos;ve been working a whole lot and it just leaves me lonely and tired. I figure my life doesn&apos;t really matter much in the grand scheme, so the least I can do is get some personal enjoyment out of it. I&apos;ve been paying attention to myself, and I&apos;ve narrowed my interests down to: eating sugar, sleeping, playing on the computer and having sex. I&apos;ve got the eating, sleeping and computers parts pretty well worked out, but the sex continues to elude me. Oh well, I suppose to have achieved 3/4 of my happiness isn&apos;t a bad percentage. &amp;#x5181;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I got this email today from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daraevans.com&quot;&gt;Dara&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Subject: hey&lt;/div&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
&lt;p&gt;Hey you!  Wanted to send you a short line to say I was thinking about you...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you got that computer fixed... sounds bad...
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;You know Will, I have been thinking a lot about our dating experience...mostly because it has been girls weekend down here in Kaedi and we have been talking about guys. I am happy right now with the way things are...I like being free...I was sorta stressful with when we were together...it was too hard to try and make a serious relationship work...but I have been thinking that maybe we can have a relationship that wasn&apos;t serious...I miss talking to you, having intellectual converstations...and I miss the sex a lot...a whole lot...I was having a good time in the bedroom...and I still think there are a lot of things I need to learn in there...and there is no better teacher than you...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you said that you wouldn&apos;t feel right doing that...was it because you think I wouldn&apos;t feel right doing that...or because you think it is morally wrong...or because of something else...but I am up for some fun when I am in town in a few weeks...as long as we don&apos;t have to be to serious...like I want to be able to do things with others and I am sure it is that way with you...and the same with WAIST...I want to have fun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go...looking for a relationship with not a whole lot of strings attached...&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;How is the school stuff going?? Still think you should apply to all of them!&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Peace,&lt;br&gt;Dara&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That certainly makes a fellow feel nice. Not really sure what to do though. The problem is that she&apos;s right; she&apos;s got quite a bit to learn in the bedroom. I like the idea of having sex, but I am not especially enamored with the idea of having sex where I&apos;m doing most of the work. Maybe this could work out well for the both of us. My gut says it is a bad idea though...&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I just got back from a week long hiatus at Marc&apos;s place. My arrangement with Miranda is that when she&apos;s got guests, I&apos;ve got to vacate her guestroom. She had someone in for the last week, so I was temporarily deplaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really nice. It was like being at a ClubMed. Not in the accommodations so much; I was living out of a backpack and sleeping on the floor. In the atmosphere though. Marc is really laid back and the most bismillah person know here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I should explain &quot;bismillah.&quot; Bismillah means literally in Arabic, &quot;in the name of God.&quot; You say it when you are starting anything, especially something you&apos;d like God to watch over. It is always said before eating or setting out on a long car ride. It is also used, more so by Peace Corps volunteers than Mauritanians, as a form of invitation. For example you&apos;ve cooked something and there are people sitting around, you might bring the pot in and say &quot;bismillah.&quot; That translated to &quot;come, take, this is available for taking.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usage makes sense and Mauritanians use it as well, just not as much. Giving is just something you do here. I was walking around with a bag of crackers the other day and ran into one of the network admins. While we were standing there talking he took the bag out of my hands without asking and grabbed a handful for himself. He can do that by rights. If I didn&apos;t want to share I wouldn&apos;t have been walking around with them. We also have a pecking order pissing contest going on, or at least he does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m pretty sure he has confused my insecurity speaking for unfriendliness. It is normal to greet for a couple minutes, especially someone I want to show respect to. I just can&apos;t do it. I run out of French words in about twenty seconds and even though I know it is allowed, I feel like an imbecile saying the same thing over and over again. Most people have gotten used to it because they know I only to speak anything, but this fellow I don&apos;t see often enough for it to sink in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anyhow, Marc is bismillah in the &quot;come and enjoy&quot; sense. Miranda has a really nice house, but I am always acutely aware of being a guest. I&apos;d never flop out on her couch and take a nap like I did a couple times at Marc&apos;s. I dunno what it is; maybe it is just how nice the place is. I don&apos;t like being the messiest thing in the room. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve not had much experience with illicit substances in my life. Before coming here, I think I&apos;d smoked pot once, and even that wasn&apos;t enough to really be affected. I&apos;d drunk from time to time, but at most parties I&apos;d nurse a single wine cooler the entire evening. The whole arena of intoxication was largely unexplored save a couple stumbling forays which ended rapidly with a loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mauritania has offered me a chance to broaden my horizons a bit. Nothing along the lines of a devolvement into debauchery or anything like that, but I&apos;ve gotten more into the bar scene more than I did in college and I&apos;ve run into some mild drugs. In particular, a friend of mine came into possession of some hashish a while back and I&apos;ve gotten better versed in the realms of high and stoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last weekend was an interesting example&amp;hellip; Tetrahydrocannabinol, aka. THC or the psychoactive chemical in marijuana, is not water soluble. It is however, soluble in both fats and alcohols. This means that if one wants to cook something with THC in it, it is much more effective if the THC is dissolved in a carrier to aid in absorption. For this particular project, our carrier of choice was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghee&quot;&gt;ghee&lt;/a&gt;, a clarified butter used in vedic rituals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had about ten grams of hash in 800 grams of butter. For reference, I&apos;ve seen five grams of hash seriously stone a group of about thirty people. So, this was a significant quantity of hash. We only used about half of the butter though in preparation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muesli&quot;&gt;muesli&lt;/a&gt;. This museli is a very dangerous concoction: oatmeal, flax seeds, molasses, honey, dried fruit and chocolate. Very tempting under normal circumstances, damn near irresistible when you&apos;re high, everything is delectable and you&apos;ve got the self-restraint of a five year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the day out with a breakfast of muesli and milk. Most everyone had between four and five tablespoons, not knowing its exact puissance, but knowing that it was likely near lethal. We then sat around playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pagat.com/invented/uno_vars.html&quot;&gt;uno&lt;/a&gt; for a bit before renting &lt;a href=&quot;http://echarry.web.wesleyan.edu/jembearticle/&quot;&gt;djembes&lt;/a&gt; (two for the day for 5000um) and heading to the beach. Some of us were starting to get sort of goofy even before leaving for the beach which was interesting since that was less than an hour since we ate. Normally it takes about two hours for eaten hash to start to get into the bloodstream. I suppose since it was breakfast, the combination of empty stomach and our bodies rhythms got things going quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had unfortunately had too much hash. A good level of high so far as group dynamics is this sort of stupid goofy giggly state. It is very much like being sleep deprived and tipsy simultaneously. Everything begins to get really funny and your attention wanders a bit, but you&apos;re still mostly present. We went past that though to pretty well &quot;fuckered&quot; as the British say. When we finally ended up out on the beach we just all lay around napping and staring at the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far as an experience it was entertaining. It just would have worked as well without everyone together in a group. It was just a shame to have everyone there and then be so content watching the waves to not talk. It was very relaxing though. Even if we mostly hung out in silence, there was still a certain sense of community. We weren&apos;t chatting, but we were still all there together, if that makes sense. Everyone wasn&apos;t so absorbed in their own world as to not be conscious of those around them. In any case, I got to work on my tan some though and play a little djembe. I wasn&apos;t especially skilled, but we had some people who were and it was fun listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 18h we wandered back to town, and I crashed on my bed pretty promptly and didn&apos;t get back up &apos;til 9 the next morning. All in all, an entertaining day. I&apos;m still really hesitant to use hash in a party setting though. I don&apos;t really understand it well enough to not end up stoning everyone into complacency. Alcohol is a cruder tool, but a safer bet. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 50%&quot;&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like being informed about the stuff I do and too interesting reads on the subject of pot are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

			<subject>Fit Quoi</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;You might remember, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/5513.html&quot;&gt;long ago&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about Lenten disciplines. Well, Ash Wednesday is this Wednesday so Lent is going to start. I am really not looking forward to this. Last year at this time I was all full of piss and vinegar; ready to grab the world by the tail and wrap it around and pull it down and put it in my pocket. Now I&apos;m older and wiser (or maybe just lazier). The idea of not talking for forty days depresses me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminati.stderr.org/pipermail/jsfromtherim/2004-February/000249.html&quot;&gt;didn&apos;t speak English&lt;/a&gt; during Lent last year. Since I don&apos;t really speak any other languages other than English, I spent pretty much 40 days in silence. It was really good for my French though and I really think it would be a good idea to do again. In the last couple days I&apos;ve been seeing how my vocabulary is getting reasonably good, but my accent is horrible. It is almost completely because I spend lots of time listening in French, but not much talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m going to temper it this year because I&apos;ve been feeling kinda lonely and depressed in the last couple months. I think spending no time at all talking for the next two months would drive me crazy. So, I&apos;ve modified my schedule a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; This is Catholic Lent, I get Sundays off. I&apos;m not Catholic, but I&apos;m not Christian either, so no use splitting hairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday - Thursday&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; No English. This leaves French as my second best option. That or hiding in my bed and not talking to anyone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday - Saturday&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; Conditional reprieve if I do a fast. I did a little fasting during Ramadan and liked how good food tasted when I waited a bit for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this way I can get out of the no English bit, but only by doing something reasonably hard. I like the idea. I also have a tendency to eat when I&apos;m nervous or thinking on something and fasting helps me learn to be more aware of my eating. I think this sounds like an interesting exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other Lent news, I&apos;ve finished my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://exrx.net/WeightTraining/WorkoutLogs.html&quot;&gt;exercise chart&lt;/a&gt;. This is a pretty sad experience really since I started the thing in October and there&apos;s only about fifteen entries on it. I have seen a little bit of progress though. Most importantly, I can do 80kg on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nautilus.com&quot;&gt;nautilus&lt;/a&gt; bench press. Since I weigh about 79kg (which I&apos;ve not weighed since high school), this means I get my dispensation. I can&apos;t do but about 70kg on the free weights, but fuck it, I wanna have the weekend off.&lt;/a&gt;</event>

			<subject>Superbowl</subject>
			<event>Well, I went and watched it last night. It was nothing remarkable. Because we are five hours off Eastern Time it didn&apos;t start until nearly midnight. To fill the intervening time we cooked and cooked and cooked. Then I ate and ate and ate. It was wondrous; chocolate chip cookies, salsa, tortilla chips, maffé, rice pudding, three different cakes, bissap wine&amp;hellip; By the time the game actually started I could hardly keep my eyes open.

It didn&apos;t matter all that much. I didn&apos;t care about either of the yankee teams playing and because the game was playing on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://myafn.dodmedia.osd.mil&quot;&gt;Armed Forces Network&lt;/a&gt; all the commercials were replaced with little Army infomercials. I managed to stay awake through it and got my football fix for the next year. In watching it I&apos;m sort of sad I didn&apos;t see it the year the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.titansonline.com&quot;&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; played and I might have actually cared.

After the game, the pilot for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fox.com/americandad/&quot;&gt;American Dad&lt;/a&gt; came on. That was pretty entertaining. Nothing terribly original, but good for some laughs. When I finally made it home at around 6am, I slept till time to go to the gym at 6pm. Other than the guy who kept calling me to complaining that I ought to come teach his class since his teacher hadn&apos;t shown up (which I disagree on), a very relaxing day.</event>

			<subject>Comeback</subject>
			<event>I had a good run over to the gym today. A car of teenagers pulled up next to me hollering shit at me. I managed to pick out a &quot;suck my dick&quot; out of the lot of it. Why is this good? Because I managed to get my response off before they were out of earshot.

As they were pulling off I flipped them off and managed to get out a collection of responses, &quot;fuck you,&quot; &quot;va te faire foutre&quot; (&quot;go fuck yourself&quot;) and &quot;gasamarak&quot; (&quot;may God shorten your life&quot;), before they got away. They pulled off the road a bit ahead of me. I kept running toward them and was gesturing for them to get out of their car and bring it. They rolled up their windows and pulled away when I got near them.

It sounds sort of serious, but it wasn&apos;t really. For one, they were Bilani teenagers. I outweighed the biggest one of them by probably 30 kilos. The standard of attractiveness is really thin for the guys and really chubby for the girls. There are a couple Maures who work out at the gym, maybe 2 or 3. It is mostly Black Africans, a few Moroccans and Libyans, and some French and us Americans. If it had come down to it, I could have probably held my own against two or three of them. It never would though. Maybe at night, but not in the middle of the day. Physical violence just isn&apos;t condoned. It would be like a fist fight breaking out in a fancy restaurant; it could happen, but it just won&apos;t.

They drove away from me and then pulled back and rolled down their windows and asked if I was English. I said I spoke English (I am still jogging at the point and wasn&apos;t going to get into semantics) and they said they were sorry. I thought that was interesting. Then they drove on. I headed on to the gym feeling proud for having remembered to curse back before the other party was too far away.</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;It is just bad programming to do &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/roster/Makefile&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;m kinda proud I got it to work though. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Inline XSLT in a Makefile&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
emails:
    @echo &apos;&amp;lt;stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; \
            xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; \
            xmlns:vol=&quot;http://pcvs.org/2004/05/volunteerML&quot; \
            xmlns:cil=&quot;urn:oasis:names:tc:ciq:xsdschema:xCIL:2.0&quot;&gt; \
             &amp;lt;import href=&quot;volunteers-html.xslt&quot;/&gt; \
             &amp;lt;output method=&quot;text&quot;/&gt; \
             &amp;lt;template match=&quot;vol:volunteers&quot;&gt; \
               &amp;lt;for-each select=&quot;$$population[not(@status)]//cil:EmailAddress&quot;&gt; \
                 &amp;lt;call-template name=&quot;EmailAddress&quot;&gt; \
                   &amp;lt;with-param name=&quot;output&quot; value=&quot;text&quot;/&gt; \
                 &amp;lt;/call-template&gt; \
                 &amp;lt;text&gt;&amp;amp;#xA;&amp;lt;/text&gt; \
               &amp;lt;/for-each&gt; \
             &amp;lt;/template&gt; \
           &amp;lt;/stylesheet&gt;&apos; | xsltproc --xinclude - volunteers.xml&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/roster/volunteers-html.xslt&quot;&gt;another stylesheet&lt;/a&gt; and calls into it to generate a list of all the email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, if you are sitting on a box with a SMTP server, try this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;telnet relay-test.mail-abuse.org&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;ll connect back to your box and try and relay through it. If you&apos;d like to do it yourself, try this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;telnet localhost 25
helo localhost
mail from: &amp;lt;fake@faker.org&gt;
rcpt to: &amp;lt;me@myisp.net&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your relay is open if you get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;250 2.1.5 &amp;lt;me@myisp.net&gt;... Recipient ok&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relays are frequently open to connections from &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;, so it doesn&apos;t really count unless you do it from somewhere else. You get the idea though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Un Flou</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Happy Late &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine&apos;s_Day&quot;&gt;Valentine&apos;s Day&lt;/a&gt;! Mine was pretty entertaining. The bits I remember at least. The day was pretty normal; I went to the uni and put together a &lt;a  href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/sed_ist_2005_outline.html&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; on basic computer repair. Then I came to the bureau and presented it to the new SED kids. It was pretty boring for all parties involved, but if you&apos;re not a big geek it is hard to get really enthralled by someone discussing computer repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening really started with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gthhh.com&quot;&gt;hash run&lt;/a&gt;. They are always pretty entertaining, and this one especially so because we there are a lot of people in town for ETR. There was a cap of 20 volunteers allowed to run. Unfortunately some of our best partiers were unable to participate, but we had a good showing none the less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hashers are described as &quot;drinkers with a slight running problem.&quot; For this reason the night is something of a blur. Highlights that I remember:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Me and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projecttrust.org.uk&quot;&gt;the Brits&lt;/a&gt; smoking most everyone else running. We kept having to slow down and let the rest of the group catch up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinking shots of some strange shudder inducing German concoction consisting of peppermint schnapps and whipped cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeing about eight people attempting to play &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.about.com/od/twister/&quot;&gt;Twister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The writhing mess that results from a bucket of ice being dumped on a crowded Twister board&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most everyone losing their shirts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinking lots and lots of beer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting whipped cream licked off my chest by some pretty girls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting whipped cream licked off me by a less pretty boy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eating quite a bit of whipped cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lots and lots of political career ending pictures being taken of everyone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dancing, dancing and more dancing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trying to smoke a cigarette and still not being terribly entertained by it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accidentally leaving my cigarette on &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcvalentin.smugmug.com&quot;&gt;Marc&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; phone and melting a hole in it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sending lascivious SMS messages in French to girls two thirds my age&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wandering out the Nouakchott&apos;s own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vip-nightclub.com&quot;&gt;VIP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drunken swing dancing to techno rave music&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being very very dizzy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buying a 2000um &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heineken.com&quot;&gt;Heineken&lt;/a&gt; that was the one beer too many&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collapsing with my head in a friend&apos;s lap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wandering home at around midnight (the drinking started at 7) &quot;shithammered&quot; as they say&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deciding I wanted a sandwich and going with Kari to find one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Falling asleep standing at the sandwich counter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waking
up with everyone in the shop looking at me since apparently they&apos;d
finished the sandwiches some time before and had to wait for me to come
back around&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kari and I managing to have between us enough coordination to make it to my place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trying to have a conversation with Molly and Miranda, but mostly just shouting incomprehensible French&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passing out on the couch and eventually getting carried to bed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waking up next to Kari and even though we&apos;d not done anything finding it entertaining to wake up unexpectedly next to a pretty girl&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wandering out at 10ish the next morning and finding myself still drunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Noticing that someone wrote cryptic French phrases all over my arms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Noticing that my shirt was covered in blue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Noticing that was because there were blue wings drawn on my back along with the phrase &quot;Je suis un ange sauf ici&quot; and a little devil tail poking out of my pants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An entertaining weekend and good preparation for WAIST. I&apos;ve really got to work on my pacing though. I trashed myself at New Years and last night I was out by midnight. I&apos;ve got to slow it down enough so I don&apos;t fall in the apples, quoi.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Firsts</subject>
			<event>This last week has been one full of firsts. I&apos;m in a bit of a rush and can&apos;t really cover the WAIST right now, so I&apos;ll do a quickie&amp;hellip;

As best I can remember, I&apos;ve never gotten burned for being too trusting. At least up until about a day ago. I came limping into town after an exhausting week and as I was getting off the taxi one of the guys who I rode in with told me he needed to call his brother and have him come pick him up. He asked if he could borrow my phone and I said &quot;sure.&quot; Then I turned around to put down my backpack and he ran off with my phone.

Suck.

I&apos;m not really that upset about it. It is just really irritating being cut off from everyone. I figure I learned to keep a closer eye on my phone in the future. I&apos;m not beating myself up over it though. I like being trusting. It is sort of like everyone is my friend, I just don&apos;t know them all that well yet. If I had to give that up to get my phone back; no deal.

So anyhow, lesson learned. This really is the first time I can think of that someone has taken advantage of me being trusting. Certainly people have tried, but I&apos;m not a complete idiot. This is just the first time someone has asked for my help and when I gave it to them essentially betrayed it.</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I am most frequently a computer geek, but unfortunately my geekery is not bounded there. Developmental psychology and analyzing the fuck out of things is also a habit of mine. I try and keep it contained, but sometimes after big events, like this last week, I just get me too worked up and it comes busting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m sorry. I try and be cool and disaffected. I&apos;ve just got a thinking problem. I&apos;m stepping up my already heavy regiment of intoxicants in hope of taking care of it. There&apos;s still a few persnickety brain cells holding out, so until I finish them off, just ignore these lapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Maslovian Peaks&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the humanistic psychology of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&quot;&gt;Abraham Maslow&lt;/a&gt;, there is the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/p/peak_experiences.html&quot;&gt;peak experiences&lt;/a&gt;. He used the term in conjunction with psychotherapy and mystical experiences, but I think it has more general applicability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that you have mental habits that are developed over the course of your life. Everything we do, we do for a reason, but sometimes stuff hangs around after its usefulness. Ask the adult children of alcoholics about the challenges of trusting again after being betrayed so deeply. Many such people will remain guarded for the rest of their lives even when they&apos;re with people they&apos;d be happier with trusting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;max-width: 40em;&quot;&gt;The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right; margin-right: 3em;&quot;&gt;-Samuel Johnson&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing habits of mind is not really a difficult process. You just watch for what you feel uncomfortable doing, figure out why you&apos;re uncomfortable and then decide if it is something you want to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of concerted effort at growth is not everyone&apos;s cup of tea. Most people are cool enough on their own to not feel a real need to play games with their head. It is something I do, but the habit was borne out of necessity as much as anything. I was so painfully introverted and depressed when I got out of high school that I had to choose between killing myself or trying to get over it. I figured I could always fall back on suicide, so gave changing a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, when someone does something that flies in the face of an existing habit it provides concrete evidence whether or not their way of acting was realistic. If things work out well then it generally leaves someone feeling freer and less burdened. Think &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0060345/&quot;&gt;The Grinch&lt;/a&gt;; the little Whos are shitty to him and he gets jaded and mean and moves into his cave on the mountain. He doesn&apos;t doesn&apos;t think he&apos;s cool enough to hang out with them and so steals Christmas out of spite. Then Little Cindy Lou Who shows him that he doesn&apos;t have to be so defensive and his heart grew three sizes that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last week I&apos;ve had two pretty solidly affirming experiences. One was spending a lot of time hanging out with a really cute and interesting girl at WAIST, and the other was walking into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iset-rosso.mr&quot;&gt;ISET&lt;/a&gt; and asking them to finance my computer repair trip around the South. These were two things that put me up for rejection and none was forthcoming. I&apos;ve been peaking a bit off of that for the last few days. Just generally feeling happy and positive. (Having my brain well sopped in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oxytocin.org&quot;&gt;oxytocin&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t hurt either.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dangers in peaks though is that because it is unmapped territory psychologically, one can overshoot. I could go around thinking myself a studmuffin or a übergeek and that I&apos;ve somehow just not noticed in the last 26 years. A bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ljhammond.com/cwgt/04.htm#8&quot;&gt;ego inflation&lt;/a&gt; is fair I figure since I&apos;ve never really had someone who knew nothing of my personality kiss me. I&apos;ve also never gone in and just asked for money from someone. Having these things work out for me is leaving me to rethink how I&apos;m perceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&apos;m keeping it fairly realistic. I know I&apos;m no sex god and though I am a minor god in the realm of computers, my near complete inability to manage my time does a lot to mediate the marketability of those powers. Under consideration though is the possibility that I might sometimes border on cute. I figure I&apos;ll head to the gym and put in some time just in case. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

			<subject>Role Model</subject>
			<event>As I mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/~ivankara/22346.html&quot;&gt;previous entry&lt;/a&gt; I decided to head to the gym. It was an impromptu decision and so I didn&apos;t have my clothes. I wasn&apos;t planning on doing anything too strenuous, so I just took off the button-down shirt I had on and was doing some light lifting in my wife beater and khakis.

As I was sitting down to do the bench the gym&apos;s trainer came up to me. Marc has told me that he&apos;s come up to him before and told him that his form was bad or whatever. I figured that I was going to get a tip of some sort. I do drop my wrists back on bench if I&apos;m not watching and I thought maybe he was going to tell me that.

It turns out that he wanted to tell me I wasn&apos;t supposed to work out in khakis. He said that it was bad for the gym if I was wearing khakis. I was a bit confused by this. I can understand why it is a bad idea for me to dirty my nice pants on grubby gym equipment, but as to why the gym should care I couldn&apos;t figure. Well, I hadn&apos;t taken into account my weight as a trend setter. He told me that if I woke my pants to work out in pretty soon everyone would be.

I must admit, I like myself in a tank top and khakis. It is actually my club outfit sometimes. Perhaps I should be more cautious with my sexiness. &amp;#x263A; At the very least, I, as an American, do carry a certain weight. Cool comes from America for Mauritania because that&apos;s where the music and movies come from. I don&apos;t really believe that anyone would start wearing khakis because of me, but it did convey a certain sense of efficacy to have someone caution me about leading others astray with my coolness.

Not that I didn&apos;t argue with the guy. I have become quite obnoxious. Back in the States I was obnoxious, but I wasn&apos;t confrontational. If someone said something to me I thought was dumb I&apos;d do it and then sulk to my friends. Now, I just bicker with them. Unfortunately, my sarcastic and questioning tones are pretty much identical in French. So when I come out with &quot;you think that if I wear pants everyone is going to do the same thing?&quot; instead of the intended &quot;what is your malfunction?&quot; I convey &quot;huh? I don&apos;t understand the words coming out of your mouth.&quot; It is probably better that way since I think people would be pissed if they realized how rude I am trying to be.</event>

			<subject>Jesus H. Christ</subject>
			<event>In what could be the most &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snopes.com/religion/tsunami.asp&quot;&gt;offensive email&lt;/a&gt; I&apos;ve gotten ever, my well meaning and apparently addled father forwarded me &quot;God Protects His Own.&quot; It is just a short inspirational message about Meulaboh, Indonesia where the nasty Muslims wouldn&apos;t let the peaceable Christians celebrate the birth of their Savior. So the day after Noel they had to all leave town to a nearby mountain to open their presents and whatnot. While they were gone God showed those meanie Muslims what-for and drowned the whole lot of them with a tsunami. Praise Jesus!

Fuck.

Does this really make someone feel good? To believe that God is a viscious son of a bitch? How the hell do you hear about hundreds of thousands of people drowning and the subsequent destruction and think, &quot;Go Jesus!&quot; That&apos;s just fucked up. I just wish people were better at keeping in mind the humanity of humanity. Unfortunately, it is all too easy to forget when the other party lives halfway around the world or when they&apos;re stupid bigoted mother-fuckers.</event>

				<body>You think that is what your Dad thinks? I was just curious, cuz from what little I know of him I wouldn&apos;t think the letter would make him feel good. I could see him thinking it was interesting in the &quot;can you beleive that?&quot; sense. Maybe even a little irony in that that is what conservative Xtians threaten non believers with and sure enough look what happened. The irony is only there though if you don&apos;t believe any God was judging those people in the tsunami. Would think he&apos;d have sympathy for the people that died regardless.

I know him just well enough to fill in the details with my own ideas though so, I wouldn&apos;t put money on that synopsis.

				<body>You need to create an account. There&apos;s some stuff that isn&apos;t public &apos;cause I&apos;d probably get in trouble with someone.

As for my dad, I&apos;ve got no freakin&apos; clue. He says the dumbest things sometimes. I do think that he is basically compassionate. Him being a bit shortsighted though is well within reason.</body>

				<body>It amuses me how some people(usually Christian) go on about the horrors of &quot;Sharia Law&quot;, while they themselves would employ something similar here if they got their way.

I don&apos;t know about your dad, but some people read these things and forget that the tsunami drowned people of a great number of religions(including Christian). Anyway, its a bummer when people are insensitive about stuff like this.

Of course, some people ask &quot;Why do bad things happen to good people?&quot; My own take is that all of us our guilty of sin and a more appropriate question is: &quot;Why do good things happen to bad people... myself included.&quot; Also, tsunami and other disasters remind me that, even if we treated others right and lived right and in touch with our environment, crap like this would still happen. Anyway, I&apos;m still recovering from my Boston trip(I&apos;ll journal about it later, suffice to say I&apos;ve been to programming languages conferences in Boston now...).</body>

				<body>To Peace Corps Parents whom it may concern;

No amount of self-righteous rightwing propaganda will ever, ever &quot;turn&quot; or &quot;save&quot; your child from their path to save the world, and in fact it will only be a sore spot of enmity between you, please stop sending it, and or discussing politics over the phone; we can&apos;t afford it, and you won&apos;t want to after you get that first $500 phone bill.

(luckily, my parents are as left as I am, but my PC roomie had, I kid you not, multiple hour-long &quot;discussions&quot; pre-voting about dubya with her father, over international long distance.</body>

			<subject>WAIST &amp;mdash; Part #1</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Ugh. I&apos;ve been pulling long days trying to get caught up on work a bit. If it is possible to work oneself dumb, I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s what I&apos;m doing, or at least blind; everything seems blurrier than normal. Maybe it&apos;s like with working out, and it&apos;ll make me stronger mentally in the long run to have stressed my brain a bit. Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I wanted to get my basic outline from WAIST recorded before my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lyricsxp.com/lyrics/l/little_plastic_castle_ani_difranco.html&quot;&gt;goldfish memory&lt;/a&gt; wipes it away. This is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; long, to the point where I had to break it up to get it to post. Here&apos;s the fist bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 60%&quot;&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/02/17 &amp;mdash; Thursday &amp;mdash; Day 0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Risky Business&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risky Business:&lt;/strong&gt; Obie got into town a couple days ago and in celebration he hosted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hasbro.com/games/pl/page.viewproduct/product_id.9491/&quot;&gt;Risk&lt;/a&gt; tournament at his house. It was an entertaining evening in general, though I didn&apos;t play Risk all that long. The other people at my table were a little miffed at me speaking French and so did me in first. I did get to go watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0283111/&quot;&gt;Van Wilder&lt;/a&gt; though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I called it a night pretty early. I found out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daraevans.com&quot;&gt;Dara&lt;/a&gt; decided that Mauritania isn&apos;t her sort of place and so is now back in the States. That put of a bit of a damper on things, and so I went home to pack up. She didn&apos;t seem very happy here, so I&apos;m glad she did what she felt she needed to. At the same time, we did have fun hanging out and I hate for anyone to go. She is the first volunteer to willingly call it quits in the whole two years I&apos;ve been here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/02/18 &amp;mdash; Friday &amp;mdash; Day 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Taxiiiii&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxiiiii:&lt;/strong&gt; Since there was a shitton of volunteers headed down to Dakar, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dunsmore-eidson.smugmug.com&quot;&gt;Jess&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to head up the organization of some group transport. At 6am we convened upon the Peace Corps bureau and loaded forty people into two big prison buses. All the seats were pulled out and the doors welded shut except for the back ones. Along the sides were two benches and then a couple stools you could set up in the middle. We managed to get out of town pretty quick and a mere three hours later we were in Rosso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We made it across the border in a record hour and a half, and there weren&apos;t even any bribe attempts. Then into sept places for another six hours to Dakar. I was with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strolle.com&quot;&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; and the timer he&apos;d started on his watch when we pulled out showed 11 hours and 59 minutes as we pulled up to the American Club to begin WAIST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I&apos;ve been practicing my beer drinking and I&apos;m to a point where I can actually stomach the stuff. If I&apos;m trying, I can even drink it and not just sip. I was getting to work on my new skill when I learned that the rosters we had to turn in for our teams were limited to twenty people apiece. This is a bit of a problem since there were about 70 of us and twenty times two is nowhere near 70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The first team had already been picked from our best softball players and the second was left empty and captianless. I figured I&apos;d take the job since the primary requirement was yelling at people to do stuff and that&apos;s one of my skills. I filled the roster the easy way: first come, first serve. This left some people who weren&apos;t paying attention to be a bit disappointed, but there was little choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Viking&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viking:&lt;/strong&gt; I pretty soon regretted my decision to capitan a team. Not that I minded the telling people that the rosters were full; everyone was really cool about that. I couldn&apos;t leave the club though and go search out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://frenchfood.about.com/library/weekly/aa010403a.htm&quot;&gt;croque monsieur&lt;/a&gt; I&apos;d been jonesing for. There&apos;s a nice little sandwich shop near the Club Atlantique called the Arc En Ciel that does a tasty monsieur. I got the roster turned in and snuck off before the captains&apos; meeting to hunt one down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;My homestay was with a cool Zambian fellow with Don King hair named Mwavi. Unfortunately, before I made it out of the club, I ran into the other people in my homestay and found out they were about to head out. I had to forgo the sandwich to go with them. It was me, Dan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/~calebjudy/&quot;&gt;Caleb&lt;/a&gt; and two Senegalese volunteers: Jess and Audrey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Last year all of the fellows who were cool and had the ability &lt;a href=&quot;http://studs.mr.pcvs.org&quot;&gt;grew mustaches&lt;/a&gt;. The tradition continued this year, but not to be outdone we had a few fellows in the new group sporting mohawks in addition. In what is not a big coincidence, they were also all fellows with girlfriends. You&apos;d have to be pretty fucking sexy to not look like a bit of a git with a mohawk. Dan who&apos;s from my group, not to be outdone by these whippersnappers, decided to follow suit. He asked me to aid him, but I was a bit tipsy and didn&apos;t figure I ought to be operating a razor, so we recruited Jess. After assuring her that he realized just how silly he&apos;d look and that she wouldn&apos;t be held responsible, she made short work of his hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Barbering done with, we all headed out the Viking. The Viking is a bar in downtown Dakar which is has a good combination of cool atmosphere and not too expensive beer (1000cfa). At one point we attempted a move to the Iguana, but discovered the beers were three times the price, and so returned to the Viking to get a little better greased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Once upon a time, there was a fellow who went through all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kfc.com&quot;&gt;KFC&lt;/a&gt; training courses, but when he requested to open his franchise in his beautiful African home of Dakar, Senegal, he was refused. Not willing to let the man get him down, he moved back and opened &quot;Cesar Friend Chicken, Kentucky&quot; which offers a surprising facsimile of the Colonel&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recipezaar.com/58947&quot;&gt;Original Recipe&lt;/a&gt;. Having gotten greased we wandered off in search of chicken, but found the place closed. I wasn&apos;t really feeling the evening (and it was 3am), so I decided to head back to Mwavi&apos;s for a couple hours sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/02/19 &amp;mdash; Saturday &amp;mdash; Day 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Softball&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Softball:&lt;/strong&gt; The first day of WAIST is an exposition series to determine the rankings for the next day. We had three games and managed to lose them all. I really liked being out on the field, but I only pitched a couple of innings this time and wasn&apos;t into the action as much as last year. I still had a whole lot of fun playing. I was doing the capitan thing and switching people in and out for a lot of the games. After a bit there was a coup d&apos;etat and someone sober took over captaining. I&apos;m not really sure why, since I think I was doing pretty good. The whole day is a bit blurry though, so maybe I&apos;m wrong on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We had a volunteer, Ben, from last year who flew over from the States just for this weekend. I really wish I could play softball. If I could, I would seriously think about doing the same thing. It was just so much fun. It seems a little silly though to pay almost $1000 to come and suck really hard at softball. Usually, I can at least hit. Not necessarily terribly well, but I make contact with the ball. It turns out that the affects of whiskey include decreased coordination. I wish someone had thought to mention this to me before I got up to bat. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Marine Party&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marine Party:&lt;/strong&gt; There are five &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usmc.mil&quot;&gt;Marines&lt;/a&gt; stationed in Dakar. They have a nice big house and every year they throw a party for everyone. Well, cover is 4000cfa and drinks are bar priced, so I suppose it is more fair to say they host a party for everyone. Lots of nice loud music and dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Something that I realized as I was walking into this party was just how many people I&apos;ve gotten to know in the last two years. I know all of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org&quot;&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but I&apos;ve also had a couple opportunities to meet people from Senegal and recognized a whole lot of faces. It was really cool walking into a room with a couple hundred people and recognizing about half of them. I probably knew more people than anyone else there since no one from Senegal or Mauritania has done as much visiting in the other country as me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Leah&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leah:&lt;/strong&gt; I wandered outside and pretty much as soon as I got out there Ban walked up to me leading a really cute girl wearing a sexy black satin top and asked &quot;how about this one, will you make out with him?&quot; She looked me over and for whatever reason went with yes. I, of course, was up for it. That&apos;s like free money. Will you take free money? Will you kiss a pretty girl? Well, duh. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;My previous shortest period of time between meeting someone and kissing them was about a month and a half. So, sufficit to say dropping to 15 seconds was a whole new sort of experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Peace Corps Senegal had a debauchery contest going on between the different regions. You got different points for differing levels. Stuff like kissing was 5 points or something. Kissing someone of the same gender was worth more and making out with two people simultaneously worth still more. I&apos;m not sure on all the details, but as a method for adding a little spice to WAIST, I give kudos to whoever came up with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;My mystery woman was a part of that. Ben was in the process of introducing her to the men of Mauritania to let her choose properly. She&apos;d already passed over a couple of what I consider to be our leading contenders. I still can&apos;t quite figure why she stopped with me. My hair has started getting curlier and as long as it is, I&apos;m working some serious &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spookyboutique.com/boutique/details/goldilocks.html&quot;&gt;Goldilocks&lt;/a&gt; ringlets right now. Maybe she&apos;s got a thing for fictional characters, I dunno. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Streaking&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streaking:&lt;/strong&gt; I wandered back inside with her to get a drink and someone said that Mauritania was about to do their annual streak. I knew that this was supposed to happen around midnight, but I&apos;d not paid attention to the time at all. I excused myself and wandered around the corner to find what was going on and found things beginning to ramp up for naked time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Another first for the evening was running about with no clothes on. All in all it wasn&apos;t that bad. I didn&apos;t have my glasses on and I was in the company of about ten other people, so I didn&apos;t feel isolated and I couldn&apos;t see anyone&apos;s reactions. Even with my poor vision, I did notice quite a few flashbulbs as we headed through the bulk of the party. Hopefully none of these pictures end up on the internet like ever other embarrassing thing I&apos;ve done here &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcvalentin.smugmug.com&quot;&gt;has&lt;/a&gt;. If it does, I hope I at least looked good. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Entering Jerusalem&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entering Jerusalem:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentin managed to miss out on the streaking somehow. He said the first he knew of it was seeing out prodigious nudity come streaming from around the corner of the building. (He may not have used the exact term &quot;prodigious nudity,&quot; but that was the gist.) Not to be left out of the entertainment he did a bit of trimming on one of the Marines&apos; palm trees and clothed himself in fronds. A few people attempted to denude him, but he managed to do a good stint wearing only &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/durer/adam-eve-1507.jpg&quot;&gt;vegetation&lt;/a&gt; and duct tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Jumper&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jumper:&lt;/strong&gt; Normally the Marine party streaking ends with everyone in the pool. The Marines had a new house this year and though there was a pool it wasn&apos;t really necessary to jump in it to finish up. The majority of us opted not to take a dip since it was cold as balls. After a bit though, the allure of standing water proved to much for some of our desiccated crew, the clothes came off again and people went into the pool. The pool though lacked a diving board and half the fun of a pool is making splashes. To remedy the situation, people scaled the pool house and started doing naked cannonballs off the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;By this time I had relocated my new friend who happened to have smuggled some gin into the party. I, therefore, had more interesting things to occupy my attention than freezing cold water. We hung out by the pool though and watched the good natured if a bit dangerous fun until one of the Marines came and shut it down. At one point Lisa came up with her camera and started shooting a movie before asking me, &quot;so, what&apos;s her name Will?&quot; I did sort of know her name. I knew I&apos;d asked it and been given it, and that it was an L name. The specifics were a little fuzzy though. I was a little uncertain about the mores for this situation, but I had a sense that having stuck my tongue in her mouth would make asking her name again a bit awkward. I&apos;ve actually seen the video which is unfortunately too dark to make out my looking over her shoulder and mouthing, &quot;I&apos;ve got no fucking clue, fuck off and go away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Chicken&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicken:&lt;/strong&gt; I eventually saw the mystery beauty off with some other people from her homestay and discovered that everyone from mine had already left. I went wandering around the rapidly unraveling party not quite partied out yet. Around the back, I discovered a big grill full of chicken. I hung out with Lisa and Kristen chatting for a bit and consuming lots of tasty poulet. Around 4:30 I got my fill and started to get sleepy, so wandered back to Mwavi&apos;s where a bleary-eyed Jess let me in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

			<subject>Captain Will</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I am very very tired. There is a Senegalese volunteer in town on medical hold. She was in Nouadhibou visiting and decided to go out for a swim. Out at the point there is a large shipwreck and she wanted to just go swim around it. Once she got close though there were currents threating to pull her under the boat and so she grabbed a hold of it to keep from going under. This is the Atlantic side of Nouadhibou and the tide is pretty fierce. While she was holding on she got battered against the boat quite a bit and cut up pretty badly before managing to get on top of the boat. After they got her off the boat, put 32 stitches in her and carted her down to Nouakchott; Air Mauritania went on strike so she couldn&apos;t leave town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, she has been hanging out with Marc and I for the last couple days. Thursday I had to work and didn&apos;t catch up with them till at night when, against better judgment, I went with them to the 3000um Lebanese place. I&apos;m pretty much flat broke at this point. Things were pretty tight, but having my phone stolen pretty much killed my reserve. What exactly I&apos;m going to do for the party I want to go to in Senegal for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick&quot;&gt;Saint Paddy&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://wilstar.com/holidays/patrick.htm&quot;&gt;Day&lt;/a&gt;, I&apos;ve got no idea. Things generally work out though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we decided to do a repeat of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/20370.html&quot;&gt;beach djembe party&lt;/a&gt;, except without the djembes since we&apos;re poor and lazy. Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/20690.html&quot;&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt; is still going on this was a fast or French day. I was really unwilling to speak French anymore, but if everyone else was going to be stoned I wanted to join in. Since I am allowed to drink stuff I made myself a nice glass of sugared milk with melted butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was odd is that I was fine for the three or four hours we were at the beach. I was a little goofier than normal, but not really impaired. I went over to visit some Senegalese fellows with the British girls and while we were talking I was all of a sudden hit hard. I wasn&apos;t completely dazed, but I kept having the sensation of coasting through the conversation. Normally you begin a statement or story with the intent of conveying some piece of information. That intent sort of guides how you talk and gives you a sense of direction. Well, I kept losing the intent. I&apos;d be in the middle of saying something and not really remember where I was headed with it. I&apos;d double back and give it another shot, but then I&apos;d lose it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just really odd for it to have taken so long. I suppose this is what happens when one drinks melted butter not having eaten anything in the last day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having fun hanging out and I didn&apos;t want to stop. Most everyone was headed to the Mexican place, and I was (a) fasting and (b) poor: a very unfortunate combination. Marc and Kay though came up with an interesting three part disposition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Captain Will had to refer to himself solely in the third person and always with the honorific &quot;Captain&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Captain Will had to end all declarative statements with a gravely &quot;arrgh&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Captain Will had to end all interrogative statements with a &quot;huh?&quot; intoned with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scooby-doo.com&quot;&gt;Scoobyish&lt;/a&gt; lilt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In return Captain Will would get to eat Mexican with his friends and they would pay for it. Normally Captain Will is pretty stubborn about changing his disciplines, but this was cute and entertaining. It also required quite a bit of mental discipline on the part of Captain Will to remember to constantly refer to himself in the third person. Arrrg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Will though doesn&apos;t really get obnoxious when he&apos;s stoned; he just gets goofy. Captain Will needs a bit of alkehol to really savor obnoxiousness (and this was going to be obnoxious), so he decided to pass by his house and grab his bottle of gin. Remember that the Captain hadn&apos;t eaten anything since the night before and it was now 8pm, and he has giardia, so his stomach was about as empty as stomachs can be. The couple shots of gin and Fanta he threw back pretty much sealed the deal. He was either going to have to eat or he was going to throw that gin right back up. So he took the plunge with a tortilla chip and soon discovered that it is quite difficult to constantly refer to oneself in the third person, and orders of magnitude more difficult when simultaneously drunk and stoned. Arrg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fun though, for me at least. I was at the point where most everything was funny, so it didn&apos;t take much. I&apos;m pretty sure most everyone else was enjoying themselves as well. We all headed out to a DVD store afterward and I watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357413/&quot;&gt;Anchorman&lt;/a&gt; with Kim. (There is just a TV and two chairs in a little booth so we had to split up.) It was a pretty funny movie with some decently quotable lines. By the time it finished it was almost 1am and we were too tired to go out, so we all headed home for some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;While at WAIST, the Senegalese volunteers were selling CDs to help finance their Gender and Development (SeneGAD) projects. I didn&apos;t get a chance to buy a CD before leaving, but I did get a cover, and I wanted to take note of the artists so that I can be on the lookout for stuff from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Viviane is someone I&apos;m interested in seeing in particular. She is Bilani and a native of Mauritania, but was supposedly banished for ten years or something like that to Senegal for being an uppity woman. Rumor is her music is a really solid blend of both the modal Mauritanian stuff and the more rhythmic Senegalese. She was in town a while back, but I missed the concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Hip hop is also really popular in Senegal. It is not uncommon to see young fellows with a side of their face covered in adhesive tape in a crude imitation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vh1.com/shared/media/news/images/n/Nelly/sq-nelly-bandaid-uni.jpg&quot;&gt;Nelly&lt;/a&gt;. I, myself, am something of a hip hop fan, so I&apos;m keeping an eye open for these as well:&lt;/p&gt;

			<subject>WAIST &amp;mdash; Part #2</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Here is a continuation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/23046.html&quot;&gt;the longest entry ever&lt;/a&gt;. I really don&apos;t expect anyone to read this, I just want to get as much as I can down so that I&apos;ll maybe be able to recall something in ten years. It is an amazing amount of info in general; I suppose the fact that each day began at 8am and went till around 4am gave quite a bit of time to cram stuff into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/02/20 &amp;mdash; Sunday &amp;mdash; Day 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Umping&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Umping:&lt;/strong&gt; Dan and Caleb,
who had gotten a bit more sleep than myself woke me up around
7:30. You know how sometimes your brain works on stuff while you&apos;re
sleeping and you wake up with an answer? Well, despite not having
really &quot;slept&quot; per se, I woke up remembering a rule from last year
that teams have to serve as umpire for the game before theirs. Since
my team was playing at 9:30 this meant we ought to be umping the 8:00
game. Fortunately, Caleb was willing to help out and we made it to the
field before the game.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;There were really only two deficiencies
in my umping. One, I was operating on about six hours sleep in two
days. Two, I don&apos;t actually know any of the rules of softball. Caleb
does however and so he was the home plate ump and I took first and
second base. To make things more interesting though, the teams playing
were Peace Corps Gambia (anglophone) and a team of Senegalese
(francophone). Caleb speaks Hassaniya and so I was the closest thing
to a bilingual person there. The Senegalese liked to argue about every
third or fourth call, so I&apos;d come trotting in from the field, get call
from Caleb and explain it to the Senegalese. Then they&apos;d bicker and so
I&apos;d repeat it yelling and tell them to send the next batter up. The
only problem was a couple times when they were actually right and I&apos;d
say &quot;no, that&apos;s not the rule. Be quiet. Go back and send the next
batter... What? Oh, that is the rule? Umm, ok, nevermind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Softball&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Softball:&lt;/strong&gt; After this
came our chance to play. Our first adversaries? The Dakar Tigers; a
bunch of private Christian middle school kids. They kicked our
asses. We were better behaved than in years past, but we still had
several mothers up in arms over the danger our beer bottles on the
field posed to their little darlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;                                                                                                                      I was playing catcher at the beginning and managed to split my
pants pretty early into the game. I didn&apos;t have any other pants on
hand and so kept playing with my split pants. I was wearing undies so
I wouldn&apos;t imagine anyone was too upset, but it was a bit
breezy. Hitchcock had on shorts under his workout pants, and so he
gave me his pants. Though the splitting passed without comment, I
think I saw some mothers shielding innocent eyes when I dropped trow
on the side of the field to change. Oh well, we were all adults, well,
other than those of us that were in middle school.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Our next game was against the
Senegalese from the game I umped that morning. True to form they kept
complaining about most of the calls. Fortunately I was in left field
and my voice was pretty much shot the previous days screaming, so no
one heard my drunken &quot;niquez vos mérés&quot; (&quot;fuck your mothers&quot;) and &quot;get
of the goddamned field, you sons of bitches.&quot; Carl was umping the game
and he would have had to throw me out. I really wanted to play and
they kept holding everything up. I was really sad because I knew it
was likely my last game ever, and I was pissed at having to play
people who cared more about winning than having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;In the end we lost by one point. What
sucked was halfway through the game there was a scorekeeping disagreement
and we gave them a point. The way it works is the ump tracks outs and
strikes, but the two teams track the score. In a really serious game
the ump checks at the end of each inning, but we were a couple behind
and when he checked there was a discrepancy. We had each of the
players we&apos;d said scored a run, and were pretty sure we were right,
but wanted to get on with playing and not bicker. So we gave them the
point.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Umping Megalomania&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Umping Megalomania:&lt;/strong&gt;
After the game I hung around for a bit because I heard that Peace
Corps Benin was playing and that they might be short players. I really
wanted to play some more and especially in a Peace Corps game. It
turned out that Benin had their requisite ten, but the umps that were
supposed to show up didn&apos;t. So, I got to be the ump for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;This was a whole lot of fun since it
was Peace Corps Benin against Peace Corps Tamba (from Senegal). They
were both just looking to have a good time and everyone was really
friendly. This is good since I myself was pretty drunk and if they had
wanted serious I could not have provided. I kept forgetting how many
strikes there were and I had to ask the batter. As for outs, the teams
took and left the field pretty much of their own accord. In fact I
wouldn&apos;t call myself an umpire so much as rowdy fan behind home
plate.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The pitchers were having a bit of
trouble getting the ball to home plate, and lots of people were
walking. There is nothing more boring than batters not swinging and
people just walking around the bases, so eventually I started awarding
bonus strikes to people who would at least try and hit the ball. That
worked better and the game started to move a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The one really big damper on the whole
thing was when someone overthrew first base and drilled Jill in the
leg. It is sort of odd that she was sitting in the first base coach&apos;s
box since she was supposed to be the line ump. I suppose it was so
that she could properly nurse her bottle of whiskey. We had a tense
bit where we carried her off the field and had a car come and get her.
Play resumed and in the end Tamba won out by a point.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Pool&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pool:&lt;/strong&gt; I wandered back
to the American Club and played a bit of Marco Polo with my teammates
in the pool. Since I had so pants I just swam in my boxer briefs. It
turns out that they are fairly revealing when wetted. Mine especially
so, since there is a sizable hole in the butt (which I learned of
from my kindly friends&apos; mockery). It is tough to effectively cover
both one&apos;s balls and ass simultaneously. I was fine though so long as
I stayed in the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After a bit I got out and put my sweats
back on and starting looking around for people from my homestay. I saw
Jess still in the pool and so went over to talk to her. One of the
other Senegalese volunteers thought I looked like I needed to do some
more swimming and came over to help me. There was a bit of a tussle
and even though I went back in I also managed to convince him to come
with me. FYI, sweatpants can hold a surprising amount of water.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Bonfire&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonfire:&lt;/strong&gt; The event for
the evening was a bonfire at one of the fields. I went and changed and
then met up with Mark and Kay to finally get my &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/23046.html#cutid3&quot;&gt;croque monsieur&lt;/a&gt;. After
some gossip and tasty sandwiches we headed to the bonfire.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I managed to catch up with &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/23046.html#cutid6&quot;&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;
(whose name I got from one of her regionmates during the day) pretty
early. We hung out for a bit chatting and whatnot. The 2000cfa cover
included all the beer you could drink, so I just wandered from one
group of drunkards to another.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Peace Corps Mauritania calmed down a
bit this year with the new kids; at the same time Peace Corps Senegal
had a much better showing than last year. This left us much more
evenly matched and there was a certain rivalry. This started to take a
darker turn as the night progressed and we decided it would be best to
just air our differences. The best forum? A &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217505/&quot;&gt;Gangs of New York&lt;/a&gt;
style brawl. So we all took the field and had two masses of about
forty people on a side yelling insults at each other. At some point
someone took the initiative and went barreling into the other group and
things turned into a free for all. It was a good natured free for all
though. It consisted mostly of people getting drug to the ground and
quite a bit of beer getting spilled.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After the brawl things calmed for a
bit. I found Leah and practiced not sounding like an idiot with at
least a bit of success. Then Mitch brought out his guitar and we
started into various campfire favorites like &quot;Closer to Fine&quot; and
&quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.&quot; My voice being completely shot for anything over
a low growl cut into my ability to participate on that one.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Julie decided that things had calmed a
bit and gave birth to the topless beer relays. I got recruited as an
obstacle and ended up standing out in the field for quite a bit
without my pants on since the topless beer relays were not terribly
well organized. A couple false starts ended up just being gaggles of
topless girls running about together (which was sufficiently
interesting to keep me from getting too bored). I gave up my place as
an obstacle after a bit since there was a girl who really wanted he
boyfriend in the relay and he obviously wanted to hang out without his
pants on more than I did.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The relays did start eventually, but
they met an abrupt and surprising end when one of the Marines decided
that it was too risque. Danny decided to discuss the matter. Turns out
that discussing things with a drunk Marine is not a great idea. I
wasn&apos;t there to hear the discussion, but I could see the Marine jump
Danny from where I was and start pounding on him. One of Mauritania&apos;s
own got ejected from the bonfire as well over the incident. It was
just a mess and managed to pretty much kill the party.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I was operating on about six hours
sleep in two days at this point as well as having spent about 90% of
my conscious time intoxicated and having just recently rumbled. I felt
like dying, but Leah was headed out to the afterparty, so I couldn&apos;t
really say no.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Viking Revisited&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viking Revisited:&lt;/strong&gt; We
ended up back at the Viking in record force. There were probably 100
people crammed into this relatively little bar. I went and hung out
with some of Team Mauritania for a bit and tried my hand at smoking
again. I&apos;m still not good at it and it still doesn&apos;t affect me enough
mentally to offset the lung cancer and death and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I came in with Leah and we were
enjoying a brief celebrity. We had our picture taken together by five
or six different people over the course of the evening. I think it was
a combination of a couple things. For my friends, I&apos;ve not really
hooked up but one time since I arrived over 600 days ago. To see me
with a girl was amusing. There also weren&apos;t all that many
international relations, so we were a bit unique in that. As much as
anything though, I think it is that we were both reasonably sweet
people. It is just cute to get a shot of sweet people being sweet even
if it is fleeting. (Though I learned later she was making out with
someone else while I was wandering around, but what&apos;cha gonna do?)
&amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Fries&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fries:&lt;/strong&gt; After some
socializing I was getting hungry and so Leah and I headed out to find
some hummus. Unfortunately the hummus store was closed at 1am, so we
settled on one of the few open places and ordered a plate of fries.
There was a bit of confusion on what exactly &quot;fries&quot; entailed. Sort of
like how the Brits have &quot;chips&quot; which are kinda like America&apos;s steak
fries. We wouldn&apos;t call these fries so much as oil soup with mushy
potato bits. Yum.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We hung out for a bit and fished some
potato bits out of the soup and let them slide down our throats. With
sufficient salt and ketchup you could pretend that they were real
fries that you&apos;d somehow already chewed and forgotten. Just getting to
hang out for a bit and talk was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Iguana&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iguana:&lt;/strong&gt;We wandered
back to the Viking and conversed more intimately in an out of the way
corner until they closed the place down. Leah decided to call it a
night, or morning I suppose since it was 3am. I was pretty beat myself
and wandered to the Iguana in hopes of finding someone from my
homestay to head home with.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The Iguana in Dakar is essentially the
same bar as the Iguana in Saint Louis (where I &lt;a
href=&quot;http://marcvalentin.smugmug.com/gallery/351214/7/14051576&quot;&gt;passed
out&lt;/a&gt; New Years). I really like the place and like the atmosphere,
but I was so tired I couldn&apos;t see straight. So, I gave up and headed
home.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Lost&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost:&lt;/strong&gt; The kindly taxi
driver who was taking me home completely lied about having the
slightest clue about where we were going. He kept asking me for more
specific directions and I kept reiterating that I didn&apos;t live here and
I had no clue. Eventually he started asking random people on the
street and this worked better than his previous &quot;random turning&quot;
plan. After about an hour we pulled up at Mwavi&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Doormat&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doormat:&lt;/strong&gt; Mvavi had
asked only one thing of us when laying out the ground rules: &quot;don&apos;t
wake me up.&quot; It was now 4am again and I didn&apos;t have a door key. I
tried my previous ploy of light knocking in the hopes that one of the
guys was asleep in the front room and would wake up. I then got
desperate and rang the doorbell, but this was also to no avail. After
about ten minutes I gave up and just curled up on the doormat. Dan and
Caleb came back about half an hour later and I drug myself into a
bed.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

				<body>That is probably for the best. I was really lucky that no one could hear me since Senegalese aren&apos;t the world&apos;s most peaceable people. I&apos;ve not seen much physical violence at all here in Mauritania, but a couple times I&apos;ve seen fights in Senegal. That I could have gotten my ass kicked is not unreasonable.

I&apos;m just amazed at times at how impolite I&apos;ve gotten here. My Southern gentile is slowly being bled out by Africa.

Have you ever done much serious cursing at someone in any language? I just can&apos;t see it.</body>

				<subject>Re: intelligence</subject>
				<body>based on being around campus during the world cup, i kinda gathered the impression that they tend to be a bit passionate.  (there were lots of senegalese students.) whenever they won a game, no matter what hour of the day, there&apos;d be like a little victory parade, yelling, shouting, etc.  

_seriously_ cursing at someone in any language?  not so much.  but drunkenly peppering my speech as if i were trying out for a role in &lt;i&gt;pulp fiction&lt;/i&gt;, quite frequently.  for a long time after partying a few times with a mixed group of brits, americans, and australians, i could barely drink without randomly yelling &quot;bloody fucking hell&quot; in the middle of conversations...</body>

				<subject>re: interjections</subject>
				<body>My favorite one when hanging out with Brits is &quot;what, what?&quot; I grab the front of my shirt in imitation of a smoking jacket and take a couple puffs on an imaginary pipe. The other new drunken penchant I&apos;ve gained is speaking really bad French really loud. Also the incidence of &quot;quoi&quot; go way up. Pretty much all sentences end in quoi with a liberal sprinkling in the middle. French is actually kinda fun when I don&apos;t mind sounding like an idiot.</body>

			<subject>WAIST &amp;mdash; Part #3</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Almost to the end of this. This one is about as long as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/23046.html&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/24133.html&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;; it&apos;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/02/21 &amp;mdash; Monday &amp;mdash; Day 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Semi-final&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-final:&lt;/strong&gt; My team
was eliminated by losing all of our games, but the good team had won
all of theirs except the first (against Team Asia) which they tied.
Going into the semi-finals their first game was against Team Asia.
Both teams were undefeated, so they both needed to lose twice to be
eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The game was pretty interesting, but it
was clear that our team was just better. My memory of the whole thing
is a little fuzzy. This was my third day operating on four hours of
sleep or less, and that with the alcohol leaves most everything a
blur.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Samich&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samich:&lt;/strong&gt; We had some of
our Senegalese brethren show up for our game since we&apos;d told them it
ought to be entertaining. Among them was Leah and after the game we
headed back to the Arc en Ciel to get some sandwiches. Like most
everything else, the conversation is something of a blur. At some
point I discovered she was an excellent horseback rider and that she
had a sense of the Middle East as a &quot;spiritual homeland.&quot; She likes
trance and electronica, but doesn&apos;t know the names of any artists. Oh
yeah, she prides herself on her normalcy. I practiced being normal
since it seemed a good idea while hanging out with someone who values
it. Unfortunately, any time I try to do anything, I start thinking and
if I&apos;m not really careful I start asking random questions. FYI, Leah
has never punched someone in the face, nor has she ever been
especially inclined to. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After samiches she gave me a hand in my
search for alcohol. There is a Score supermarket near the American
Club that carries all the major types of cheap whiskey: Black, Club7,
Dark Molly, Bony Old Man... We had, over the course of two days,
emptied their stock. A liter of Black costs around 2200cfa ($4.50). A
liter of Johnny Walker is about six times that much. I was looking for
effect since as long as I live I will never buy whiskey for the taste.
So we hopped on a route taxi and went down to a gas station she knew
of, then back for the last game well supplied.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Championship&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Championship:&lt;/strong&gt; The last
game was against Team Asia again since they needed to lose twice to be
eliminated. The coaches considered briefly rotating in the second
string and increasing the chances of losing the game since that would
have left us with a final game where either team stood a chance to win
the championship. It was eventually thrown out as being sort of
insulting since there was really no way they were going to win against
the first string and it would be just postponing the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;To be honest the game was less engaging
than last year because the teams were not evenly matched. The final
score was something like 19 to 9 which is a slaughter in softball. I
don&apos;t really enjoy heckling people who are losing. Team Asia&apos;s
supporters had a good time however. Since there were probably a
hundred Peace Corps volunteers standing around cheering the taunts
tended toward personal hygiene, lack of utilities and gastrointestinal
afflictions. Everything stayed friendly though which was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Drunkenness&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drunkenness:&lt;/strong&gt; In honor
of our last game pretty much everyone was shitfaced. My stomach was
really not pleased with me when I told it more whiskey was moving in,
but there wasn&apos;t an outright revolt. After the first little bit I was
too busy running around yelling to really notice feeling nauseous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;For me drinking is as much about
permission as actual intoxication. I don&apos;t know if I like that or not,
but it&apos;s true. I&apos;m not normally really comfortable acting like an
idiot, but if I&apos;ve got a bit of a drunk going on I can sort of
separate actions out as part of drunk time and not have to have them
be a part of sober Will&apos;s identity. It sounds sort of immature, but as
I think about it I like it. It means that people can count on getting
one set of more reserved and responsible behaviors normally. Then for
party times I can be looser and less responsible, but it is contained.
That I might integrate these two, I guess is possible, but I don&apos;t see
any real reason to try for it.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Case in point, there were big bags of
chalk that had been used to mark the field on the sidelines. I got
into it and came out covered in chalk up to my elbows. I then went
looking for something interesting to cover in chalk. Our t-shirts were
white so this didn&apos;t offer much potential. One of the members of our
staff, Cheikh, was there and he was decked out in a full suit; dark
brown; perfect. I walked up to him and gave him a nice big hug leaving
two huge white handprints across his back. In mere moments he was
transformed from a run of the mill softball spectator to a unique and
intriguing work of art, and I told him this before wandering off to
find something else black to hug. He liked it though, no permanent
damage done and it included him in fun that he had been mostly
watching to date.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;My next target was a little less
amicable. Alice taught me that apparently an equitable exchange for
the soiling of a black fleece is the emptying the better part of a
beer into the offender&apos;s pants. Lesson learned, and I&apos;d run out of
both chalk and desire by that point.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We won the game handily and took the
field in a huge rowdy mass. We pulled Cheikh out onto the field and he
got carried around by the crowd for a bit. There was much rejoicing.
After things calmed down a bit it was decided there should be an all
Mauritania mostly naked game and we retreated to the American Club
with this purpose in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Pool Time&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pool Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Someone had
locked the field and so naked softball was canceled. I somehow got
involved in a rather unfortunate game which has no name and only rule:
try to whack people in the balls and avoid being whacked yourself.
Does this seem like a dumb game to you? It does to me. Unfortunately
even if you don&apos;t want to play you don&apos;t have much choice when fellows
are looking to damage the family jewels.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;As the day progressed even girls got to
join in the fun. It didn&apos;t have quite the same pain factor, but titty
slapping was decided upon as the target for the ladies. One of my
favorite stories is from Kim later in the evening. She had been
playing the ball game and was a bit intoxicated. She asked a friend of
a volunteer visiting from the States to take her picture. He decided
to be cute and instead of taking a picture of her and her friends, he
took a picture of himself. Forgetting momentarily that not everyone
was playing the game, she walked up to him and drilled him in the
nuts; dropping him to the floor. I reckon the poor guy learned not to
mess with Peace Corps girls; they don&apos;t fuck around. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I was hanging out with some of the
Senegalese volunteers doing my best to converse casually while
protecting my privates when Carl and Lewis decided that I had far too
many wearable clothes, carted me to the pool and tossed me in. Last
year I destroyed my Peace Corps id jumping into the pool with my
clothes on. Fortunately, my passport, which was in my pocket, was of
more resilient construction. Most of my stamps are now doubled on the
facing page, but it is none the worse for wear.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Nap Time&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nap Time:&lt;/strong&gt; At this
point I am wet, tired and a bit stressed from having my manhood
imperiled. I want nothing better than to go back to Mwavi&apos;s, curl up
and take a nap. The only thing that would have made it a thousand
times better would be to have someone to do it with. Leah was at the
pool and I really wanted to ask her, but I didn&apos;t know how. I didn&apos;t
want her to think I was trying to get her back to Mwavi&apos;s to ravage
her. (Not that the idea wasn&apos;t enticing, but I really did need a nap.)
In the end I just asked her and she turned me down to meet up with
some friends. I got distracted though and before leaving decided to
give it one more try, and amazingly she accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;So we went back and fell asleep for a
bit and it was oh so nice. I&apos;m a big fan of snuggling and whatnot.
People just need to touch people sometimes. After a while she headed
out to go get dressed for the evening and I went back to do the same.
I didn&apos;t do a terribly good job of it and fell back asleep for about
half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Dibi&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dibi:&lt;/strong&gt; The meeting
place for the evening was a place that makes chicken dibi. I&apos;d seen
&quot;dibiteries&quot; around and when I asked them what they were they made it
sound like a butcher. Well, it turns out that a dibiterie isn&apos;t a
butcher, it is instead a specific style of Senegalese cooking. The
chicken is done up with spices and mustard and grilled and it smelled
really tasty. I was just woken up, late and hung over, so I didn&apos;t
eat. It is on the list now though of stuff to do on my return.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The girls were, as a group, looking
quite impressive. Leah had on a very flattering black and green
outfit. Myself, I was wearing a &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.diesel.com&quot;&gt;Diesel&lt;/a&gt; shirt specifically chosen by
my fashion consultants (aka. the British girls) to make me look sexy.
It was indeed a fine looking shirt, but completely the wrong feel for
accompanying a girl in a slinky black dress. In particular when
coupled with my jeans, the last pair of pants I had that were neither
split nor wet from being thrown in the pool. The jeans were arguably
workable with the shirt under normal circumstances, but I&apos;d recently
&lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/24133.html#cutid5&quot;&gt;rumbled&lt;/a&gt;
in these jeans and so they were quite grubby.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Soirée&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soirée:&lt;/strong&gt; The soirée was
5000cfa to get in. It was fun though: seeing so many old and new
friends. The dance floor was absolutely packed. During a good song you
couldn&apos;t help but dance since if you tried to hold still the people
around you would move you. As was normal for most of these events,
beer was included in the cover, so most everyone was tanked yet again.
I just wandered from conversation to conversation, and then onto the
dance floor. It is mostly a blur...&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I remember hanging out by the pool with
Ben who had his MVP award tied around his neck. After a bit someone
took it from him and threw it in the water forcing him to dive in to
get it. I remember losing Leah for a bit in the crowd and having
someone tell me she was on the dance floor. I came out to find her
dancing with Carl and I told him to keep his hands off her or I&apos;d kick
his ass. I remember telling the story of my dad getting drug along a
barbed wire fence by his horse, and rather than comic it coming off
morbidly violent. Round about 2am they kicked us out and Leah and I
hung out for a bit longer before finally calling it a morning.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been looking back over my entries and it appears that I do nothing but party anymore. This is only mostly true. I do occasionally pretend to be mildly productive. For example, today and tomorrow I am finishing up my semester one class. I need to write out my prep for tonight and I figured I&apos;d do it here to demonstrate that I am occasionally productive. I also find it interesting, and perhaps the geekier among you might be of accord.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;It is written in my horrible excuse for French and I apologize to the entire nation of France ahead of time for the butchering. I can&apos;t spell for shit because so many French words have silent consonants at the end and I almost exclusively speak. I&apos;ll get a dictionary and fix it up later&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Qu&apos;est-ce que se passe sur le réseau quand vous démarrez votre ordinateur&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Ce que on va faire ce soir c&apos;est qu&apos;est-ce que se passe sur le réseau quand vous démarrez votre ordinateur et accédez un site-web.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Quand vous allumez le ordinateur quel est le premier chose qui se passe?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Le carte réseau essaye de déterminer quel mode de utiliser. Quel est le nom pour ce processus?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Autonégociation.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Le carte réseau pour ce poste est 100 megabit et nous avons un hub (concentrateur) de 10 mega et un switch (commutateur) avec des portes de 10 mega et 100 mega. Quel seront les modes utilisé entre ces appareil?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10Mbit hub&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10Mbit half duplex&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10Mbit switch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10Mbit half duplex ou 10Mbit full duplex&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;100Mbit switch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10Mbit half duplex ou 10Mbit full duplex ou 100Mbit half duplex ou 100Mbit full duplex&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L&apos;ordinateur va continuer d&apos;allumer. Quel est le prochaine chose qui va arriver? Une indication: le poste a besoin d&apos;une adresse IP, quel sont les options pour comment il peut recevoir une adresse?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Static Adressage&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;RARP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reverse Address Resolution Protocol&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;BOOTP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bootstrap Protocol&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DHCP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ce réseau utilise un serveur DHCP et le poste et configuré de le accéder. Le requête DHCP est quel sorte de paquet?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Protocole&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;UDP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MAC Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Adressé MAC du poste&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MAC Destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Adresse de broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;IP Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pas défini&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;IP Destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Adresse de broadcast (255.255.255.255)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Port Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;68&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Port Destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Puis le serveur DHCP réponds avec un paquet UDP avec le MAC destination du poste et IP destination du broadcast (parce que le poste n&apos;a pas encore une adresse IP). Le premier paquet ne donne pas une adresse parce que il est possible d&apos;avoir plus qu&apos;un serveur DHCP dans un réseau. Quand un serveur DHCP donne une adresse, il réserve cette adresse et il ne donne pas cette adresse à un autre poste, donc le poste choisi quel serveur il veut utiliser. Ça évite les adresses qui sont réservé mais pas utilisé.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Pour demander une adresse, le poste envoies un requête DHCPREQUEST au serveur et le serveur réponds encore avec un DHCPACK qui contenait les informations de configuration (adresse IP, passerelle par défaut, serveur DNS, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Maintenant le système est prêt. Le réseau n&apos;est pas utilisé jusque vous lancez un browser web et accédez une site. Quel est le premier paquet qui est envoyé? Une indication: le poste doit convertir entre le nom domaine et un adresse IP, donc il doit contacter un serveur DNS (Domain Name Service).&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Il a reçu un adresse IP pour un serveur DNS dans le réponse DHCP. Comment est-ce qu&apos;on peut voir cette adresse?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;ipconfig /all&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;adresse est 192.168.99.254 (on utilise un serveur DNS locale qui est aussi le passerelle par défaut et serveur DHCP). Pour contacter le serveur DNS, qu&apos;est-ce que le poste fait? Une indication: ça dépends sur si le poste déjà connais l&apos;adresse MAC. Comment est-ce que je peux savoir si l&apos;adresse MAC est déjà dans le tableau des adresses?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;arp -a&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Grâce au serveur DHCP est aussi le serveur DNS, l&apos;adresse MAC est déjà sauvegardé. Si le serveur DNS était une parti du même sous-réseau, mais pas déjà connu, le poste devrais envoyer un requête ARP avant le requête DNS pour trouver l&apos;adresse MAC associé avec l&apos;adresse IP du serveur DNS. Pour notre réseau l&apos;adresse est déjà connu, donc le poste peut construire un requête DNS tout de suite:&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Protocole&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;UDP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MAC Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Adressé MAC du poste&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MAC Destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Adresse du serveur&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;IP Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;192.168.99.14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;IP Destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;192.168.99.254&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Port Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Au hasard&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Port Destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Le serveur demande des autres serveurs et éventuellement il réponds avec une adresse IP pour le nom domaine. Quel commande peut-on utiliser pour savoir l&apos;adresse IP pour yahoo.fr?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;nslookup yahoo.fr&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Faisant ça, l&apos;adresse pour yahoo.fr est 217.12.3.11. Ça c&apos;est quelle classe de réseau? 217 = 0b&lt;strong&gt;110&lt;/strong&gt;11001, donc c&apos;est une classe C parce que les premier deux bits sont un et le troisième est zéro.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Maintenant le poste a une adresse IP pour le nom domaine yahoo.fr. Quel est le prochaine paquet? C&apos;est clair à nous que yahoo.fr c&apos;est pas une partie de notre sous-réseau, mais comment est-ce que le poste sais ça?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;L&apos;adresse IP pour le poste est 192.169.99.14 est le masque de sous-réseau est 255.255.255.0. L&apos;équation pour déterminer si une adresse est un partie de notre réseau est:&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Adresse Poste AND Masque Sous-Réseau&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;=&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Adresse Destination AND Masque Sous-Réseau&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; border: thin solid&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;217&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;AND&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;217&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; border: thin solid&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;192&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;168&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;AND&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;192&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;168&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border-top: thin solid&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;217.12.3.0 n&apos;est pas égal 192.168.99.0, donc l&apos;adresse de yahoo.fr n&apos;est pas une partie de notre sous-réseau. Quel sont les adresses dans le paquet alors?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Protocole&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;TCP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MAC Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Adresse MAC du poste&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MAC Destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Adresse du passerelle&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;IP Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;192.168.99.14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;IP Destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;217.12.3.11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Port Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Au hasard&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Port Destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Notez-bien que les adresses de destination. L&apos;adresse IP et l&apos;adresse du yahoo.fr, mais l&apos;adresse MAC et l&apos;adresse du passerelle par défaut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le poste commence avec un paquet SYN. Yahoo.fr réponds avec un paquet SYN/ACK. Finalement le poste réponds encore avec un paquet ACK et le connexion est ouvert. Puis le poste peut envoyer un requête HTTP pour le site-web. Quand le serveur a fini, il envoie un paquet FIN pour dire que le connexion est fermé.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;/lj-cut&gt;</event>

				<body>whee!  i&apos;ll admit i didn&apos;t read the whole thing, but the french was looking entirely readable for the first few paragraphs...  granted, i share any tendencies toward franglais and i don&apos;t have much computer vocabulary, but i was following.</body>

				<body>I realized, as I was finishing writing that, that it took me about an hour to write out. I think it would have been about the same in English; maybe 15% faster. My vocabulary is still limited and I can&apos;t really use but four tenses with any effectiveness, but I can se débrouiller now.

Having a little bit of confidence has really made a difference in class. We now generally go for an hour to an hour and a half. Before we would often do just a half hour or something because it was so tiring for me to try and convey information. I really wish I had another year. I am finally to a point I feel at least mildly effective as a teacher.

Do you get to practice your French much? I just feel certain this is all go to fade so quickly back home. I&apos;m managing here, but it doesn&apos;t feel concrete enough to stick. I noticed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://meetup.com&quot;&gt;meetup.com&lt;/a&gt; that some cities have French practice clubs. Getting in one of those would be such a good idea for me.</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been spending the day spinning my wheels pretty much. I&apos;m trying to get the firewall configured for my lab, but every time I make a little progress I hit another wall. Right now the perl script for adding users to the samba domain controller is choking on the unicode characters in the LDAP distinguished name. Doesn&apos;t that just figure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I&apos;ve also been ramping up to finish our semester one class. I was hoping to do it tonight and I told all the students we would be, but in looking at the info I&apos;d have to cover it just isn&apos;t going to happen. I&apos;m really not sure how this is going to work out. I&apos;ve got a couple really good attentive students who have been coming to class. It really does make a world of difference to have at least one or two students who come to class and seem to give a damn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the others, I don&apos;t know what to do other than fail them. People can usually manage to squeeze by here, but this time it is going to be tough. I don&apos;t decide on the curriculum and I don&apos;t make the exams. There really is a huge amount of information to learn. I sent the lists of goals to them today to maybe put a bit of a scare into some of them and get them to come to class.&lt;/p&gt;

			<subject>Faire Un Pipe</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I enjoy Valentine&apos;s Day. Well, I like the romance bit. Get dressed up and go out to a nice restaurant, maybe a little dancing. What&apos;s not to like? good food, dancing and dress-up generally culminating in some lovin&apos;. I have been told though that I am a bit of a girl. &amp;#x263A; Regardless, this new holiday also sounds like a good time. Mmm, steak&amp;hellip; I would do someone serious physical harm for a steak. More so than for a blow job, interestingly, and it has been almost two years since I&apos;ve had either.&lt;/p&gt;

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Ahh, all done: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/23046.html&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/24133.html&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/24774.html&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; and this is four.

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/02/22 &amp;mdash; Tuesday &amp;mdash; Day 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;MTV Morning&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;TV&lt;/sup&gt; Morning:&lt;/strong&gt; I woke back up a couple hours later as Dan and Caleb were packing up to head out. I had no desire to move and Leah was going to be in town for a couple days, so I rolled back over and fell back asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Chez Lucia&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chez Lucia:&lt;/strong&gt; I was phoneless however,so this meant that I had to go from one prearranged meeting to another. Lunch for the day was at a Cape Verdian place downtown called Chez Lucia. It was absolutely crammed when I got there. I ended up sitting with Leah and Ben and getting serenaded by come random fellow in Serare before we got a table.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The food was really good and there was a ton of it. I couldn&apos;t say the name of my dish at the time I ordered it, so I certainly can&apos;t remember it now. It was sort of a chicken corn stew spread over rice. Everyone ate really well and we all left satisfied. Ben and I got in a bit of trouble for savaging off of other plates. The people were done with them though, so I don&apos;t see as it was anything other than just not being wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/02/23 - 25 &amp;mdash; Wednesday - Friday &amp;mdash; Days 6 - 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Blur&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blur:&lt;/strong&gt; Honestly I think I damaged my brain somehow during the course of WAIST. I can remember very little from the next three days. Memories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I went to get ice cream with Leah and talked about her not eating things with four legs and possibly joining the Israeli Army&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I traded favors with the IT guy for Peace Corps Senegal and got him some info on Cisco courses in exchange for a cable to repair the router in Aioun. (That cable was an absolute bitch to find. I&apos;ve found one person with a cable here in Nouakchott and they want 12000um ($45) for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=db9+rj45&amp;amp;scoring=p&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; that costs $1.50 on the internet. Finding it in Dakar was nearly as difficult)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched a good half dozen movies at the Peace Corps&apos; house in Dakar. They had a literal wall covered in VHS cassettes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I caught up with Diagina&apos;s cousin and traded drugs with him. Diagina has an ulcer and they don&apos;t sell the drugs in Mauritania that he needs. He had some sent up from Senegal before, but they were the wrong dosage, so I was part of an exchange&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wandering around Liberty 6 asking for where the Peace Corps house was. Before coming down the Peace Corps&apos; office in Senegal sent us all a notice telling us about the many marauders wandering the streets of Dakar that would take our money and life if we gave them half a chance. I eventually gave up and called the house for directions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Riding around with Guy and Leah listening to Guinean music. A little bit softer than my usual fare, but good stuff quand même&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watching a opossum sized rat pace back and forth across the wall behind the Peace Corps&apos; house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A metaphor relating kisses to flying. That perhaps if I found myself with the ability to fly I might just sort of float around even if I didn&apos;t have anywhere to go; just to relish the gift. Discovering that there&apos;s a pretty girl who doesn&apos;t hit me when I try and kiss her being much the same&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wearing the same dirty jeans for three days because I had no choice. Granted, a very small amount of forethought could have gotten my pool pants dried, but I lacked even that small amount&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giving Leah tabs from various Coke cans. I&apos;m not sure if I ever explained that they were redeemable or what they were redeemable for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Goodbyes&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goodbyes:&lt;/strong&gt; As with all good things, this one eventually had to come to an end. Leah and I had the &quot;this has been fun, but we live in different countries and are both headed to parts unknown soon&quot; talk. I was a bit sad, it&apos;s unarguable. I&apos;m just glad to have gotten a good week.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/02/26 &amp;mdash; Saturday &amp;mdash; Day 9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Dragging Home&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragging Home:&lt;/strong&gt; Bright and early in the morning, Leah helped me hunt down a souvenir bottle of gin to take home and I headed off. I made it to the garage pretty quick, but it took almost an hour before we left town. This was a bit of a problem since the border closes at 6pm and I was too poor to spend another night in Senegal. When it was 5:45 and we got a flat, I started to get a bit worried.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We finally pulled up to the border at about 6:30. There was now a formalities fee of 1000cfa that everyone had to pay. When I came up though the guard just smiled at me and told me he liked Peace Corps, how cool. To get across then we had to deal with the pirogue guys. Normally crossing is 300cfa. One fellow told me 500cfa and then another said 2000cfa. There were some Mauritanians crossing with me and I decided to let them negotiate the price. For me, I didn&apos;t like the idea of paying any more than I had to for financial reasons. Mauritanians and Senegalese though till have some serious issues dating back to the events of &lt;a href=&quot;http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_1741574636/1989_Mauritania.html&quot;&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;. For the Mauritanians it was a racial thing and so I knew they&apos;d fight a hell of a lot harder than I would. In then end it was 1000cfa.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Once across there was a customs officer waiting. He told me that the border was closed and that I couldn&apos;t cross. The pirogue had already left and I pointed this out to him. He said we would have to call another to come and take me back so I could sleep in Senegal. I told him that I didn&apos;t have enough money to cross again and that if I had to I would sleep on the ground right here. I was more than willing to play the waiting game and he could tell, so eventually he gave up and took me to write my passport in the book. I gave him 750cfa for his trouble even though I&apos;m pretty sure I could have not done anything.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;So I bribed my way over the border for just over $2. How cool is that? The funny thing is that Marc arrived at almost the exact same time the day before and he got thrown in jail. I must just look nicer or something. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I spent the night in Rosso mostly
hanging out with &lt;a
href=&quot;http://sdrosch.journalspace.com&quot;&gt;Stephanie&lt;/a&gt; and watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shrek2.com&quot;&gt;Shrek 2&lt;/a&gt;. She gave me some insights into the nature of women and a hair mask. Thus equipped I hopped into the back of a pickup truck with 15 other people and a mere three hours later I was back home. Almost immediately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/22016.html&quot;&gt;my phone was stolen&lt;/a&gt;. Home sweet home.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</event>

				<body>It was Leah that was going to join the Israeli Army. If she wanted to claim citizenship apparently she&apos;d have to do the mandatory two year stint. Myself, I&apos;ve decided I want to join the UN army if I go for some military service. I bet they don&apos;t have anything as cool and subversive as the CIA or Special Ops, but it&apos;d probably be more cosmopolitan and morally palatable.

When my little brother was in the Army it sounded like a fascinating experience. Hard as hell, but I bet it&apos;d be amazing. I&apos;ve got a deal with a friend here that if he doesn&apos;t make it into grad school, we&apos;re going off to &lt;a href=&quot;http://shaolins.com&quot;&gt;shaolin school&lt;/a&gt; for six months. I&apos;m actually half serious about doing it.</body>

				<subject>Re: armies</subject>
				<body>can one really go directly into the UN army?!?  i always figured they were troups collected from national armies.  hrm... i&apos;ve actually been tempted to join the military lately, just for the shortcut low-cost method of getting more challenging work (not to mention trying to sneak into the language school and getting in hella good shape), but i don&apos;t think i&apos;m comfy enough with being a low rung in our foreign policy... but the UN army, that would rock!

then again, so would shaolin school... (but not having enough money to pay 3 mos. tuition, i&apos;ll stick with my kempo for now.) so many options...</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Can anyone do this better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;(read line; while [ ! -z &quot;$line&quot; ]; do
  echo &quot;$line&quot;;
  read line;
  done;) &amp;lt; iptables-rules.forward&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;IFS=&quot;
&quot;; for line in $(cat iptables-rules.forward); do echo &quot;$line&quot;; done;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I wanted to try and do it only with built-ins. I really dislike the parenthesis and having two &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;s in that first one though. What I really want is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;4&amp;lt;iptables-rules.forward;
while [ $(read -n4 line) ]; do echo &quot;$line&quot;; done&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&apos;Cept that don&apos;t work.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Calciné</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been in the lab quite a bit in the last week getting caught up on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/firewall_setup/&quot;&gt;firewall&lt;/a&gt; and my classes. The biggest evidence for my occupation is my regular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/calendar/&quot;&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;. I have a limited capacity for concentrated work; after a bit, I all of a sudden discover I&apos;m not working, but instead recounting my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/25523.html&quot;&gt;lack of oral pleasuring&lt;/a&gt; to God and the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I got bored and wandered the net for a while. I took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=2433319677885706722&quot;&gt;mythological profile test&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;lj user=&quot;rumielf&quot;&gt;&apos;s journal. (I&apos;m a roc, btw.) While there, I noticed that the site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com&quot;&gt;okcupid&lt;/a&gt;, is a dating sort of site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/25890.html&quot;&gt;WAIST&lt;/a&gt; left me remembering how I like dating and realizing I miss it. Granted, I live several thousand miles from everyone, and I don&apos;t expect to do any dating here, but I made myself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=8004480526343419820&quot;&gt;an account&lt;/a&gt;. I figure just talking to someone would be entertaining. I&apos;ve enjoyed reading the different profiles of people. Still not sure about the general dateability of the fairer sex, but I&apos;m finding two years does wonders for developing willingness to try.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Lenten Bitching</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m going to go on for a bit. I feel the need to complain, but I don&apos;t think that it&apos;ll make sense without a little background. So, here is a load of philosophy stuff and then some bitching&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Not Catholic. Not Christian. Why Lent?&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve got something I want to write, but I&apos;m having trouble with how to do so and not have it come out as a bunch of mealy mouthed new age crap. I believe in the validity of these precepts, but at the same time they are easily abused.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;An excellent example would be the &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.moretolife.org&quot;&gt;Kairos Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve done a couple of workshops with them and generally found their ideas useful, but some of the people who work with them get too dogmatic. I wanted to look up a website for them and the first Google Search for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22kairos+foundation%22&quot;&gt;&quot;kairos foundation&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.factnet.org/cults/Kairos_Foundation/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; denouncing them as a cult.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;A big part of what distinguishes a cult from more benign groups of like minded people is tied in with exclusivity. One of the things that makes me squeamish about the LT stuff is that they&apos;ve taken several concepts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology&quot;&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic&quot;&gt;humanistic&lt;/a&gt; psychology and repackaged them. I understand that they are selling to a Average Joe and that he isn&apos;t looking to get a psych degree. All he needs is some methods for straightening out problems with his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Some people get to thinking that the only people who get these ideas are the Kairos people and therein lies the danger of cultishness. It isn&apos;t like they&apos;ve got a monopoly on the phenomena. I come from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bristoltn.org&quot;&gt;buckle&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_belt&quot;&gt;Bible belt&lt;/a&gt;. I grew up with people who knew God personal and who knew all the rest of those heathens were headed straight to Hell. The difference between fundamentalist Christians and Kairos people is there are enough fundamentalists that you aren&apos;t allowed to call them a cult anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I&apos;ll try not to sound like I&apos;ve given over my autonomy of reasoning. One of the things the Kairos people do during a weekend is make all the participants take on a set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/l/life/melicia.htm&quot;&gt;disciplines&lt;/a&gt;. I can&apos;t remember most of them, but they were stuff life:&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No more than one cup of coffee a day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No smoking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No non-prescribed drugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No cursing (Maybe, I forget)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;There was a general broad spectrum of things covering the sorts of things that people do without thinking or which they do to calm themselves down.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;It is based around the idea that you&apos;ve got a map of reality in your head. (I think Peck explained the idea pretty well in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743243153/mentorreadingsug/&quot;&gt;The Road Less Traveled&lt;/a&gt;.) Every moment of every day you&apos;ve got data coming in and you&apos;re making hundreds of choices about what you&apos;re going to do. The vast majority of these are made without conscious intervention. Sort of like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pachinko.com/english/&quot;&gt;pachinko&lt;/a&gt; game where the pegs are set, an event comes in, and a decision pops out the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;The basic configuration of pegs (i.e. values, fears, etc.) that most people have come from their parents. Most everyone has at least a couple things they are not happy with in themselves. Perhaps you&apos;d like to be more outgoing or more caring or more disciplined or whatever. Dealing with those issues requires that one can recognize what&apos;s there now. A big reason for the disciplines is to make what is normally unconscious and smoking and cursing are things people often do without thinking. Breaking those routines can be used to help someone get used to paying attention to the stuff that&apos;s going on inside.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;The other major part of changing is gaining the actual power. This hits on another generally hokey subject: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_esteem&quot;&gt;self-esteem&lt;/a&gt;. Self-esteem has come to mean self-aggrandizement in the popular vernacular. As baseless warm-fuzzies it has little meaning. As a recognition that people both have self concepts and that these concepts frequently affect their behavior in self-reinforcing ways; it can be very important.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;People are not all reliable to the same extent. I have friends for who if they tell me they are going to do it then that task goes into the &quot;done&quot; bin. I have other friends that I know to check up on. This awareness of reliability holds true on an internal level as well. People have some idea of whether they can be counted on. Take a look at your New Year&apos;s resolutions. How serious were you when you made them? How do you stand with them now?&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that I can make a decision and stick to it even when it is not entertaining is one of the things that meditation helped with. Sitting staring at the wall for twenty minutes can get really boring. To sit down and do it even when you know it is going to suck requires discipline. (More than I&apos;ve got currently since it was a part of Lent and I&apos;ve done it a grand total of three times.)&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;The ability to change how your reactions is based on those two aforementioned characteristics: perceptivity and reliability. Disciplines tie into the development of both of these. This, combined with being easily bored, is why I do &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/20690.html&quot;&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt;. It has been frustrating having people talk to me about God being upset if I break my discipline. I don&apos;t generally correct people since if they didn&apos;t bother with finding out I was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoist&quot;&gt;Taoist&lt;/a&gt; to begin with, I figure not much will be gained by disillusioning them.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that I prefer the God arguments to the more informed arguments of people who tell me that I&apos;m just wasting my time and no self-improvement will come of this. The first is just uninformed whereas the second is my friends in what I consider a breach of their duties of friendliness. As a friend I consider it my job to, if not agree with, at least tolerate the eccentricities in my friends if it seems to be something really important to them. Oh well, I suppose everyone can&apos;t be as good a friend as me. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

			<event>Ugh, feel like was hit by car. Spending the night sleeping on concrete after a 14 hour car ride will do that to you. I&apos;ll have to do the details later though. I got into town to find my lab barred and this computer&apos;s keyboard is filled with sand. Typing on it for more than a few minutes starts to hurt my fingers because you have to pound the keys so hard.

Anyhow, I&apos;m off to find some food and maybe a movie. Tomorrow is the last day of French. Mashallah.</event>

			<subject>Saint Patrice</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Alright, I am back in my lab. It took me most all of yesterday and this morning to find out why they&apos;d barred the door. Well, I never did figure out exactly why they&apos;d barred the door. As best I can tell it is over accounting problems and maybe me letting people work in here. Being direct isn&apos;t really a strong point here. In any case, the door is open now and I&apos;m getting caught up on work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just got back from another trip. This time down to Senegal for some visiting and a Saint Patrick&apos;s Day party. I&apos;d never crossed an international border to go to a party before, so this was another new experience. One of many it was to turn out&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/03/15 — Tuesday — Day 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Blurry Boghé&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurry Boghé:&lt;/strong&gt; Marc and I decided to head down to N&apos;Dioum, Senegal for their Saint Patrick&apos;s Day party. We&apos;d both met a lot of volunteers during WAIST and figured it would be a good time and a chance to catch up with new friends. An unfortunate spat of scheduling issues prevented both Leah and Kasia from making it; much to Marc&apos;s and my disappointment. One must continue on through travail though, so we headed on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To set the tone and alleviate the boredom of the five hour taxi brusse ride to Boghé, we ate a goodly quantity of hash granola before heading out. This was my third time doing it and it was the most I&apos;d eaten. It worked out really well. We had about an hour and a half to make it to the garage and get everything sorted out before the stuff set in. So, we got the tickets all settled and pretty much toute de suite were completement foncedé. I don&apos;t really remember much of the ride. From looking in my phone I apparently sent Sarah several text messages in haiku form about my brain being hot. I also finished some book whose title escapes me, surprisingly. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Risk&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; It turns out they have a Risk board in Boghé as well as a TV and DVD player and fairly large pornography collection. I spent the rest of the day indulging as many of the seven deadly sins as possible; mainly sloth and lust since I hadn&apos;t done anything to be proud of, didn&apos;t have anything to eat, and all the rest aren&apos;t that much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Marc went out and came back with tasty grilled chicken for everyone and over a game of Risk he, Mark, Dan and I started drinking. Mark wasn&apos;t really looking to imbibe, but the rest of us set in with a vigor. Since we were doing whiskey shots and since both Marc and Dan have significantly stronger constituencies than I, I was pretty soon absolutely wasted. It hadn&apos;t really been a goal, I just kept taking the shots Dan offered to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I&apos;m still working on my guy drinking. I&apos;m a dancing flirting kind of drunk most of the time, but when it was just us guys that wasn&apos;t really an option. So I got to practice guy bonding stuff. Not a bad time at all. It didn&apos;t last all that long before I passed out to the sound of Dan telling me to take more shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/03/16 — Wednesday — Day 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Coupage&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coupage:&lt;/strong&gt; The next day was scheduled for recovery time. Unfortunately the power went out about 9am and was out for most of the rest of the day. This eliminated the many DVDs and I soliced myself by spending most of the day in hammock reading Dan Brown&apos;s Angels and Demons. For lunch we went over to Dan&apos;s host family and had some tasty tcheub-u-jen (rice and fish). We were supposed to go hunting for monkeys that are found in the Boghé environs, but the pervasive heat robbed us of all initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For dinner we built a fire, roasted three kilos of chicken and I made mashed potatoes. We all ate about two pounds of chicken and I put away another pound of potatoes at least. I was well stuffed by the end and happy to have finally had an opportunity to get my gluttony on. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/03/17 — Thursday — Day 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;N&apos;Dioum&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&apos;Dioum:&lt;/strong&gt; The crossing from Boghé to Dodel is an entertaining one. You pay 5000cfa for a horse cart to take you about two hours across the desert. The tricky part is that the Senegal River is divided at this point, so you have to cross it three times and most of the time you are actually on really big islands. The most entertaining crossing is the middle river where you are in a canoe made from a hollowed out log. They roll the axle of the cart up on the back of the canoe and you cross with the horse swimming along beside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After we got out to Dodel it was another 200cfa and 45 minutes to make it to the Peace Corps house in N&apos;Dioum. They were surprised to see us. I don&apos;t think they&apos;d actually expected anyone from Mauritania to make it down. Little did they know our drive to party. &amp;#x263A; By the end of it, a low turnout and other Mauritanians wandering in from other places nearly left us outnumbering Senegalese volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We rolled into town about 13h and payed our unlimited eating and drinking fee. Seemed a real waste to spend a bunch of money and not indulge. So, I helped make short work of an undercooked sheep, then some salsa and cookies. All the while working my way through Gazelles and Flags (Senegalese beers) to reach tipsyness. I realized that I was there when Dan, Naomi and I were sitting on a couch in an otherwise silent room yelling at each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Slow Warmin&apos;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow Warmin&apos;:&lt;/strong&gt; Because things started off so early there was a real risk of (me at least) burning out. I must be getting old, but after six or seven hours of drinking I start to wane. I took myself a little break and made some headway on my book waiting for the sun to set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once the time arrived to bien chauffer, we started in with tequila shots. The party hadn&apos;t yet really heated up, but we were all getting liquored. Part of the problem was the music which wasn&apos;t bad, but a lot of it fell into that classic trap of cool music that is completely undanceable. That and a lot of what we were playing was Senegalese dance music. Fine music, but it doesn&apos;t draw Americans to the dancefloor. I&apos;d burned a CD real quick before leaving and wanted to play that. The problem was that there was no CD player. There were three IPods though. I can&apos;t even imagine how ubiquitous those things must be in the States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the end I had to rip the CD and put it on an IPod to play it. Here&apos;s my N&apos;Dioum St. Paddy&apos;s Day Mix:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Water Works&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water Works:&lt;/strong&gt; Marc was also doing his part to help liven things by organizing a wet t-shirt contest. The problem was that they kept throwing water at the dance floor and I was constantly on the dance floor. Pretty soon someone just drug the hose over and sprayed at will. The wettest t-shirt was on me very shortly. Fortunately someone had already relieved me of my pants, so at least those didn&apos;t get wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As hot as it was during the day it was surprisingly cold at night. Being sopping wet and dressed only in boxer briefs did not improve the situation very much. Also, the Senegalese guys who were providing the speakers were wanting to leave at like 10pm. A Senegalese soirée doesn&apos;t even start until 11 or 12, so I don&apos;t know what was up with that. We managed to get them to hang around &apos;til about 10:30, but then they packed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Hot In Here&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot In Here:&lt;/strong&gt; Deprived of our dancing we began searching for other pursuits. Cole had the excellent idea that we set him on fire. He had ripped his caftan earlier in the evening and figured we&apos;d finish it off. We were a bit over-prepared. We had people standing by with a water hose and a fire extinguisher. Cole though didn&apos;t so much burn as smolder. It was a good idea, but in practice not terribly exciting. Dan gave him a shot with the fire extinguisher just for good measure though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Sex, Politics and Religion&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex, Politics and Religion:&lt;/strong&gt; We all wandered in at this point since Cole wasn&apos;t providing sufficient warmth. People sat around talking for a while and one bunch of people went to watch Children of the Corn. I don&apos;t watch scary movies unless I&apos;ve got someone (preferable pretty and female) to hide behind. So I hung out with Naomi and Modjulie and chatted. The conversation was entertaining. Modjulie didn&apos;t like talking politics or religion, but she was more than happy to answer sex questions. I&apos;m always curious to hear women talk about sex and she proved to have quite a bit of staying power. (I&apos;d been vocally denouncing the Senegalese volunteers lack thereof when things started winding down before midnight.) It was 4:30 when we finally called it a night. It was one of those entertaining talks though where I&apos;d have guessed it was 2 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/03/18 — Friday — Day 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Recoup&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recoup:&lt;/strong&gt; The next day was another recovery day. We&apos;d discussed heading on to Gourae in the afternoon, but the allure of DVDs and air conditioning proved too great. We spent the day napping and watching movies. I also made it most of the way through my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/03/19 — Saturday — Day 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Lazy&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lazy:&lt;/strong&gt; Round about 9am we all made it up. The plan was to head off to Bakel; about six hours by taxi. We lay around for an hour or so and someone noticed that the N&apos;Dioum house had the extended version of Return of the King. We&apos;d drunk all the beer (about six cases) in the last two days, but we could buy more. So the question became: movies and beer versus long taxi ride. Beer and movie won out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I collected some money and wandered off to a restaurant carrying a ten gallon bowl. Shortly I returned with about ten pounds of tcheub. We all crowded round and it was a good meal. Being able to feed people at less than a dollar a person is really handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Most of the rest of the day went to movies. The beer place didn&apos;t open until night, so we had to wait on that. Eventually we made it into town and got sandwiches and beer and whatnot. There was a lot of the grilled corn being sold on the street. It is interesting because it isn&apos;t corn like you get in the States, it is just feed corn, like for a horse, plunked down in charcoal and burned a bit. It is quite tasty though and I ate quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Risk&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Once we got back with the beer Dan wanted to play Risk. The problem was a lack of a board. A piece of chalk and the kitchen floor soon repaired that problem. The pieces were then different decks of cards. It was fun though Marc decided to exercise a vendetta against me from a previous game and we took each other out of the game. I ended up watching Bill and Ted&apos;s Excellent Adventure in short order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Nate and I then went out in search of a soirée that we&apos;d heard of while in town. The Maison de Fete proved a good venue other than them keeping the windows closed to keep people from sneaking in. Dancing though was mostly in a circle and I still don&apos;t really feel Senegalese music. That and telling what a really black person looks like in a really dark room is pretty much impossible. It wasn&apos;t looks so much as ages. Before heading out I got my picture taken with a girl. I&apos;ve not gotten it yet, but I&apos;m curious to see if she was fourteen or twenty-eight, since I have no real clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/03/20 — Sunday — Day 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Roadie&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roadie:&lt;/strong&gt; The next day we finally hit the road. A resurgence of laziness kept us from making it on the road &apos;til about noon when it is hot as hell. After a while though we made Bakel. Nate was doing a show on Radio Dunyaa. We brought over a case of beer, got drunk with the Senegalese DJs and played some American music. It was a lot of fun though I didn&apos;t talk very much. My air name was Idy Fall which is the diminutive of my Islamic name from Stage (Idrisa).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For whatever reason the station manager really liked the song Sweet Home Alabama by Lynrd Skynrd. We played it early in the evening and then our grande finale was the lot of us singing it for the people of Senegal. If you&apos;d have asked me what I thought I&apos;d do in Peace Corps, drunken Sweet Home Alabama on Senegalese radio would not have made the list. It was a whole lot of fun though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The place that Nate had to crash in Bakel resembled nothing so much as a Taiwanese whorehouse without the whores: filth and smallness were the defining characteristics. I wouldn&apos;t have cared but that there were only two matelas and five of us. So we asked the DJs if some of us could stay at the station. One guy told me he had a spare matela and I could have it. When I went in to sleep though I discovered that his extra matela was the other side of his double bed. Oh well, I&apos;m a bit loose when drunk, so I just plopped down and worked at falling asleep before he came in. He kicked me a lot during the night and I woke up with his arm draped on me, but I&apos;m pretty sure I didn&apos;t give it up. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/03/21 — Monday — Day 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Gourae&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gourae:&lt;/strong&gt; We crossed over and spent the next day with Nate in his village. That was fun and interesting. Nate has a pet monkey that was good for lots of entertainment. We watched the first season of Ali-G and hung out with his family. For the night we went to visit one of his exs who was really cute. Unfortunately, something had crawled up Marc&apos;s ass and died, so I spent as much time hoping no one would blame his foulness on me as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2005/03/22 — Tuesday — Day 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Taxi&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxi:&lt;/strong&gt; We got up bright and early to make it back. Unfortunately the police took almost an hour to check three passports, so we missed the first car. 8000cfa was the cost for the trip, but our car kept stopping and breaking down. So, a seven hour ride took thirteen. This put us at the border at 11pm. The border closes at 6pm. You can cross clandestinely, but you&apos;ve got to watch for the cops. We did, but then didn&apos;t. I&apos;ve never been arrested before. The thing was our jail cell didn&apos;t have bars or anything, so it wasn&apos;t all that exciting. Since we weren&apos;t legally in Senegal we couldn&apos;t call Peace Corps for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the morning they let us out and we got a taxi home. I hurried to the university to teach my class, since we are almost done. I arrived to find the door barred. Great. So instead I took the Brits up on their offer of more tequila. I started questioning proper sex etiquette (since I was recently chastised) with the query (I&apos;m still only speaking French) est-ce qu&apos;il faut manger la chatte? The consensus to date seems to be that it isn&apos;t obligatory, but it is very rarely unappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>Since I know not a single utterance of French I took the liberty of translating that last bit of anecdote. I think it both looses and gains a certain something in the translation... don&apos;t you think?

est-ce qu&apos;il faut manger la chatte = should the she-cat be eaten</body>

				<body>The difference in &quot;chat&quot; and &quot;chatte&quot; in that the &quot;t&quot; is not pronounced in the first and it is in the second. The difference in meaning is &quot;cat&quot; versus &quot;pussy&quot; in English. You could possibly be talking about a cat when saying &quot;pussy&quot; in English, but more than likely you aren&apos;t.

I learned the difference one night when hanging out with a French girl. (The second crush I&apos;ve had in my life, but that&apos;s a whole other story.) She was bisexual and we&apos;d been talking about that as well as siblings and pets. I casually asked her she liked &quot;chattes&quot; wanting to know if she was fond of felines. She promptly turned a couple shades of red. After a couple minutes and some explaining, she realized I hadn&apos;t meant to ask her, &quot;so, you like pussy?&quot;

Ahh, the joys of speaking in a tongue I hardly comprehend.</body>

&lt;div&gt;Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Jump into experience while you are alive!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;What you call &quot;salvation&quot; belongs to the time before death.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If you don&apos;t break your ropes while you are alive,&lt;/div&gt;

			<subject>Quizzes</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/26753.html&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; a couple days ago, I made an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=8004480526343419820&quot;&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; on a quiz site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com&quot;&gt;okcupid&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve been piddling around and have since taken two geek tests and have not been satisfied with them. In fact I&apos;ve mailed the authors of both of them because I thought there were errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=2060508967041547245&quot; title=&quot;1337 H4X0R Test&quot;&gt;first one&lt;/a&gt; had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, which command would you use to copy a file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cp syn@cheese:/cheese /cheese&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;scp /cheese:syn@cheese /cheese&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ssh -lsyn cheese&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;???????????????????????????????&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As root on a Linux box I can run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;mkdir syn@cheese:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;touch syn@cheese:/cheese&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;cp syn@cheese:/cheese /cheese&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;touch /cheese:syn@cheese&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;scp /cheese:syn@cheese /cheese&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means either #1 or #2 is a legal way to copy a file. I&apos;m not even really sure which one the author wanted to be the right answer. I would guess #1, maybe? Assuming that he didn&apos;t know that the scp command does a local copy if there is not a valid host part at the beginning. I dunno. He never responded to my message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=13522135040784118566&quot; title=&quot;Computer Geek Test&quot;&gt;second test&lt;/a&gt; had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public void Compute(int x) { try { int foo = 1024/x; foo = 1; System.out.println(foo); } catch(Exception e) { System.out.println(&quot;22&quot;); } catch(DivideByZeroException e) { System.out.println(&quot;Error 1&quot;); } }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s the output of Compute(0)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;22&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Error 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one might be fine. I don&apos;t know for sure what language it is written in. The &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt;s suggest strongly java, but &lt;code&gt;DivideByZeroException&lt;/code&gt; doesn&apos;t exist in java and it does in .NET. Even if it did, you can&apos;t have a try block which catches a superclass (&lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt;) before a subclass (&lt;code&gt;DivideByZeroException&lt;/code&gt;), so this isn&apos;t valid java in any case. I don&apos;t know .NET and don&apos;t have a compiler to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on this one I&apos;m not sure. I&apos;m still waiting to hear back on what language it is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;border: thin solid; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 1.5em&quot;&gt;I heard back from the guy and he told me he knew it was not valid. He just hasn&apos;t had time to fix it yet. He said he was shooting for people to pick &lt;code&gt;22&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I&apos;ve not really been entertained by either of them. I&apos;m wanting to write my own real geek test. I was wondering of the geeky among you, what would you put on it? I&apos;m wanting to try and get some broader conceptual stuff so that someone can&apos;t just google an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the destination MAC/IP in a DHCPSOLICIT serviced by a DHCPv6 relay agent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the DHCP server&apos;s MAC / 255.255.255.255&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF / FF05::1:5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF / No IP (ethernet broadcast)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the relay agent&apos;s MAC / FF02::1:2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That question is one that just looks complicated. If you know what &lt;acronym title=&quot;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol&quot;&gt;DHCP&lt;/acronym&gt; does, then you can answer it. It is used for a machine to get initial configuration information. Looking at the name of the packet, SOLICIT, you might correctly guess that this is the first packet sent out to find which DHCP servers are on the network. That eliminates #1 and #4 since both of those use a known MAC address. The machine doesn&apos;t know any addresses though because it isn&apos;t configured to be a part of the network yet. #3 can then be eliminated since DHCP is a UDP protocol (i.e. layer 3, so it has to have a layer 3 address). That address is the broadcast (255.255.255.255) in IPv4 or the multicast FF05::1:5 for IPv6 which, as you might guess, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc3315.txt&quot;&gt;DHCPv6&lt;/a&gt; covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So someone has probably a 75% of guessing this if they&apos;re just slightly geeky. A more difficuly class would be something so arcane you aren&apos;t going to find it on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What command will locate a file somewhere below the current location on a VMS system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find $(pwd)/./ -name filename&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ls --recurse | grep filename&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;search [-]filename&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;write sys$output f$search(&quot;[...]filename&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t know? This one is trickier. The first one is a valid, if convoluted, way to do the operation in a bash shell. The second is a trickster because it would work in a bash shell except the argument is &lt;code&gt;recursive&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;recurse&lt;/code&gt;. It is there to trick people into thinking they found the trick and going with the first one. The third one is just made up. It includes the DCL representation of the current directory just for kicks. The last one is the right answer. How you going to get that? That&apos;s what separates the men from the boys. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want more stuff like the first one though. Stuff that a geek ought to bed able to figure out if they&apos;ve got the background. Putting really arcane stuff on there really just tests what people have run across. My first mainframe was &lt;a href=&quot;http://gemini.tntech.edu&quot;&gt;gemini&lt;/a&gt;. That it was running VMS was just happenstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to cover the classes of geekiness. I think there&apos;s a difference between a geek (someone fascinated by a subject) and a dork (someone socially maladjusted) and a nerd (someone who is intelligent). I&apos;ve got a friend here who is a music geek. He knows a shitton about indie groups and he is really snide about it at times. He is a geek about music in the way I&apos;ve got friends who are about computers or chemistry or whatever. So I want information questions more so than, &quot;was canceling Enterprise a travesty?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any good math or science sort of questions? Maybe internet culture stuff? (googlewhacking, whitehats, war chalking, etc.) I need some gradated questions too. A common one is what OS are you running or what is your &lt;acronym title=&quot;Mail User Agent&quot;&gt;MUA&lt;/acronym&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>I finally got &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/nouakchott_notes/&quot;&gt;Nouakchott Notes&lt;/a&gt; done. Mashallah. It took me over a month to start. Why? Hmm, as best I can tell: I suck. Doing a project like that is something that is hard to do piecemeal. With classes and travel and projects and whatnot it was hard to get a solid block. I only managed to get this one by turning down a birthday party, a day at the beach, a movie and a potluck dinner. Hey, I&apos;m popular. Cool. &amp;#x263A;

I&apos;ve got a webpage project to finish up and an exam to give tomorrow before heading off to my COS conference. I&apos;m supposed to go and be productive. Ick. I just want to go and sleep on the beach. Maybe do some drinking and dancing; relax quoi.</event>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dragons-keep.net&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; has just gotten himself a new host for his sites. He offered to let me live there. If I&apos;m down for another month I may take him up on it. I just want to get back online before people start delinking me.</body>

				<body>I don&apos;t remember. not huge so far as websites go. Maybe 15000 hits a month or so. The bandwidth was huge though because a lot of people just pulled down all of them. I remember the logs reporting 40 or 50 gigs some months.

I just get a real kick out of adding a little bit of something useful to the internet. I wish Elijah would bring me back&amp;hellip;</body>

				<body>Well, since not all my students have paid yet, I need to pass them so they&apos;ll pay.

That&apos;s actually been a fun point of contention since I&apos;ve not been able to get the list of who has paid and who hasn&apos;t. I&apos;m going to balk and nobody&apos;s passing until I see who&apos;s paid.</body>

			<subject>Bien Dancer</subject>
			<event>Ahh, dancing&amp;hellip; I finally made it out last night after my busy work week. I&apos;d actually done a bit of planning and bought a liter of both whiskey and gin while I was in Senegal and smuggled them in. (I spent the night in jail with them tucked safely in my bag.) About 10pm I headed over to a hotel where some volunteers were hanging out and watching a fine piece of &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0242592/&quot;&gt;cinematography&lt;/a&gt; starring David Hasselhoff.

I was feeling pretty peppy since I&apos;d not seen anyone for almost a week and I&apos;d not really been normal all through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/20690.html&quot;&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt;. It messes with your brain when you change a habit. Sometimes I&apos;d say things in French when I meant to speak English. Pretty much all the time when I&apos;d try and speak English on the weekends, I&apos;d keep stopping myself thinking, &quot;no, speak French, oh wait, I can talk English, ok.&quot; That process really broke the flow of my speaking quite a bit and it would take a couple of days before I&apos;d regain normal speech. Even now I&apos;m definitely a lot more aware of how thoughts get shaped into words.

Regardless, I was excited. Unfortunately, David Hasselhoff had sucked most all the energy out of the room. After sitting there bouncing for a bit I started to get calm too. Heureusement, the British girls showed up and they helped pull the energy back up a bit. Then came the shots. Between six of us we drank both liters of alcohol in about half an hour. I wasn&apos;t completely fucked up, but I was definitely a bit riled.

There wasn&apos;t anything to do really, so we headed to the club to do some dancing. I personally think that I dance pretty well. I&apos;m not all stiff and self-conscious like some people. I&apos;ll grant you that I&apos;m not the most coordinated person out there, but I feel the music and I&apos;m having fun. Well, after I&apos;d been out there for a bit I noticed Marc beside me mocking how I danced. I asked one of the Brits if I danced stupid and she responded &quot;we all look like idiots when we dance.&quot; Aka. &quot;yes.&quot; Dammit.

Oh well, I like it too much to stop. It&apos;ll just have to go on that sadly long list of things I like but can&apos;t do well. What&apos;cha gonna do?

We kept going for quite a while. A few more volunteers showed up after a bit and eventually things wound down around 3:30am. It was nice to get out and party again. It had been almost two weeks. &amp;#x263A; I&apos;m off now for COS conference where I figure out what the hell I&apos;m doing when I get back to the States.</event>

				<subject>Practice</subject>
				<body>Honestly, I think dancing is just like everything else: to be good at it you have to actively practice. I once saw a few guys in Knoxville trying to shake a tail feather. They were pretty good, but it was obvious that they spent a lot of time watching MTV and practicing the moves off the dance floor. I had never really seen guys (straight ones) dancing without girls and making an effort to dance well. It made me realize that like everything else dancing comes naturally to some and to others with practice. 

I personally feel like a dork when I try to dance because I just don&apos;t know what I&apos;m supposed to do. I &quot;feel the rhythm&quot; but that&apos;s only half of it. You have to have something to do that works (ie expresses how you feel yet looks pretty good at the same time). I think some people just manage to pick up on what to do without having to really think about it. 

I think if you enjoy dancing and want people to think you look good doing it you should watch people that look good dancing and practice that.</body>

				<body>i tend to agree with the british girl: most people, even the relatively good dancers, look pretty stupid dancing  :)  the not being too self-conscious about it is the first step, though.  

as far as people who &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; look good, my favorite place to go up here attracts a bunch of folks really into breakdancing, and they&apos;re incredibly fun to watch... but at the same time, one of my favorite things about dancing is the little bits of communication that go on... slightly matching styles with someone nearby who&apos;s doing something cool, then noticing somebody over there who&apos;s trying to pick up your rhythm... i can&apos;t do that with the breakers, they&apos;re their own show.  

oh, and a quick tip: you&apos;ve had ballroom, right?  one of my absolute favorite things is when someone who knows a little bit of swing or salsa or whatever comes up and uses the basic bits -- armwork, turns, directional stuff -- to whatever rhythm happens to be playing.  make up the footwork. if you can find a girl who can follow, it&apos;s a super-easy way to look flashy.  and fun.  i have no idea how or why strangers try this on me, but it&apos;s fabulous when it happens.</body>

				<body>One of my co-workers can breakdance really well. It&apos;s like he has no bones in his body! A sight to see- impossible to mimic.

I just want to get to a point where I can &quot;dance like no one&apos;s watching&quot;. I&apos;ve found alcohol helps but the awareness of my body never leaves me. Ahh, my head - it&apos;s a fun place to be.</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Wow, COS conference was quite an experience... Supposedly if you are a monk at certain monasteries in Tibet, you have a trial that you have to undergo in order to pass into the inner sanctum of he brotherhood. I feel about that battered without the benefit of any real reward for having survived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the COS conference is, at the least, threefold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduce volunteers to the various administrative procedures associated with closing service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discuss with volunteers their plans for after their return to the United States&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow the whole of the group a final opportunity to reconnect and see one another before we disband&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me the important part was by far the third. I&apos;ve got a pretty good grasp on job hunting and grad school applying. I can read well enough to understand a manual on COSing. This is the last time that I may see some of these people, and that meant a lot to me. I have said it before, and perhaps it sounds overly sentimental, but these people have become a sort of family for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Le bien et le mal&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things got off to a bit of a rocky start. I went to the uni to get my laptop and the music I&apos;d been downloading for the last week to play for us. Once I got there I found they&apos;d barred the door again. I was pretty pissed. It is their lab and they can do whatever the hell they want, but it had my computer in it and Miranda&apos;s printer as well. I spent a couple hours walking around with Caroline bitching about how hard I tried to work to help them and how much them being ingrates riled me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was nothing to be done about it though, so I went to the bureau and caught the car for Keur Macene ahead of time. Keur Macene is a resort hotel near the Senegal border. It serves two main groups of people: people coming down to visit the bird parks of Diawling and Akjoust, and people coming to hunt the wild boars the inhabit the area. It is situated on a lake and quite picturesque. We&apos;d rented the whole place out and everyone had little bungalows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think that I&apos;m going to go into my usual level of detail on this journal. Usually I write to capture memories. Right now I&apos;m still a little upset and I need to write to just get some stuff out. I am really glad that I went to COS conference, it was just, as I said, a bit trying. The lion&apos;s share of the trauma came during the course of one night&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things began well enough. Back when I was starting back into working out and complaining of being sore, my dear Aunt Sharon sent me some essential oils that one can mix another oil to make a massage oil. For various and sundry reasons though I&apos;ve not really used them at all. After our sessions for the day I got to get some practice in. It is actually relaxing to relax into finding the tension in someone. You know how there are Zen tea masters who make tea to center and clear their mind. It is that sort of repetitive calming thing for me on both ends; like the tea, but with more rubbing. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;d purchased a stock of alcohol for the weekend: 33 liters of cheap Senegalese gin and whiskey. Unfortunately we are of a rare talent in the consumption department. Eight liters a night was getting finished off in no time at all. So, we cut back on a couple nights and the third one, this night, was the &quot;balls to the wall&quot; get plowed night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about 21h45 at this point. I was feeling pretty drained from the long day and I figured I&apos;d take a fifteen of twenty minute nap to rest up. The next thing I know I hear someone futzing around with the door. I feel like I&apos;ve been sleeping too long and start to wander over to the door to see what&apos;s up when it opens of it&apos;s own accord and a lit bottle rocket is tossed in. I&apos;m sort of drowsy, but this serves to wake me up pretty quick. I only managed to get &quot;motherfucker&quot; yelled and onto my bed before the thing goes off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&apos;t really upset for my sake, but for my roommate, who ended up with me only because there were no free rooms, I felt a bit sorry. She is a significantly more responsible person than I am. She had gone to bed around 23h, and was working on getting a good night&apos;s sleep. I recognize that irresponsible dumbass is not necessarily a career path that everyone wants to devote themselves to. I feel bad when it gets foisted on unwilling parties just for being around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been asleep quite a while. It was past midnight. I went out to the tent where there was still had quite a few people up and started playing catch-up. Fyi, I am horrible at playing catch-up. I&apos;ve gotten pretty good at getting drunk and managing my drunk over a period of time. Getting drunk fast, I tend to miss my mark, sometimes dramatically. This night was no exception and I was about six sheets to the wind in a surprisingly short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only had electricity at the camp until about 12:45 and they cut it off somewhere in the midst of my many shots. We continued the evening by candlelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to preface the next bit by saying that I&apos;m pretty insecure about my attractiveness. As a friend I think I&apos;m really cool. I know I care about people and that I&apos;m generally engaging and interesting. I&apos;m a bit of a dork and I can talk too much, but it is not to the point of being a real irritant to most people. So far as being cool or sexy though? No real idea how I do there at all. The night before a bunch of us had a very instructional sex discussion and I realized just how much consensus there seemed to be on perspectives and how little I knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A topic of discussion leading up to the conference was, &quot;this is it; is there anyone you&apos;ve been interested in that you&apos;d like to hook up with?&quot; For me there were only two really. Neither one of them were girls that I shared values or interests enough to date, but we have fun together and they&apos;re cute. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m a complete whore in just kissing on someone for a bit. Maybe I am; that goes back to the whole lack of any sort of clue as to how more casual relationships work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the girls is involved in a successful, and it sounds like really interesting, relationship with a national. I hadn&apos;t really gotten to talk to her in a while, and we got to catch up some during this conference. That was cool, but she was out of contention so far as kissing. The other one I wasn&apos;t really sure about, but I would definitely have been open to the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my other friends was asking her what she thought about me and her response got to me quite a bit. Not that she was mean; quite the contrary, she was exceedingly nice. She told me that attraction was a mysterious thing and that for whatever reason she just didn&apos;t like me. A very nice and very palatable response. I am also pretty much certain a complete crock of shit. I&apos;ve known this girl not to have a firm opinion on&amp;hellip; actually, I can&apos;t think of anything that she has not had a firm opinion on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been varying degrees on politic in responding to unreciprocated attraction. There are lots of valid reasons that two people wouldn&apos;t get along. As I mentioned before, I&apos;m working an irresponsible dumbass sort of angle right now, and that doesn&apos;t necessarily suit all tastes. If she had said something about that, I&apos;d not have been pleased, but it wouldn&apos;t have hurt like her being nice like she was. The only time I&apos;ve ever gone the route that she took and said something about the ineffability of attraction has been when the truth was too uncomfortable to state; usually physical attractiveness. To have her say it to me miffed me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t really remember the entirety of my response. I remember lying down on the floor beside her and asking her to kick me in the nuts so that I could hurt on the outside as bad as she was hurting me on the inside. I also remember a couple &quot;fuck you&apos;s&quot; and a &quot;shut the fuck up.&quot; Later reports said that I called her &quot;probably more profanity than she&apos;s been called ever before.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was cursing a lot, but I wasn&apos;t really angry, and I didn&apos;t sound angry. There was an unfortunate bit of feedback: she was hurting my feelings by pitying me, but I don&apos;t thing she knew anything other than she was upsetting me. Being a nice person this caused her to be nicer which just made it worse. Eventually, I just crawled off to the people who were playing guitars and tried singing to take my mind off the whole bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wandered around for a bit chatting with various people. After a bit, I settled onto a matela to take a break. Closing my eyes though turned out to be a bad idea. The room was spinning more than my cast paper stomach could handle, and I crawled outside to throw up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done that, I was called over to one of the boats. People were hanging out in the boat talking. I sat down on the side, but I was still feeling a bit dizzy so I decided to lie down. I rolled into the bottom of the boat and then lie there just staring up at the sky. It was very relaxing until I felt water pooling around my feet and then starting to seep into my pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could feel movement and I thought we were going out for a little spin. I guessed there was a little water in the bottom of the boat and that was washing onto me as the boat was getting level. Turns out I was wrong on both counts. I was in fact in a half-hull skiff, like is used for some sorts of sailboats. There was no real back to it at all and I was getting wet because the back of it was sinking under my weight. I also pretty soon realized I was all alone in my skiff and I was about twenty yards out in the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started then to voice my displeasure to my so called friends back on shore. I pointed out that I was drunk as fuck and I couldn&apos;t sit up; let alone swim. The goddamned boat they&apos;d set me adrift in was sinking, and I was very likely going to die. I also make many marked aspersions as to their promiscuity. &quot;Whore&quot; was the word for the evening in general. I&apos;ve been working on incorporating &quot;putain&quot; into my French more, and it shows in my English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, Valentin came out in another boat and rescued me. I was sort of angry at this point and I was questioning Marc as to who exactly was responsible for putting me out there. I knew that Marc himself was a part of it, but him having just saved my life seemed basis for at least a temporary reprieve. One of the other parties was a girl and I wasn&apos;t really quick to retaliate against her. In the end it was between two guys, one of whom has been going to the gym with me and is bigger than me. So, after Marc and I got back and both fell into the lake I went off in search of the final party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to me, he in fact had nothing at all to do with me being out there. He was off talking to someone while the whole thing was going on and only came out at the sound of my voluminous profanity while in the lake. I actually had people in bungalows all the way across the campement say they could hear my screaming. I didn&apos;t really take time to verify my information though. The tact I took was more of a running tackle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was dark, and I think I&apos;ve mentioned I was a little tipsy. These two things combined kept me from noticing that he happened to be standing by another boat. The first I really noticed of it was as my face was headed toward the edge of the boat. We landed with pretty much all of mine and his weight on my neck as we hit the boat. This was a really solid hit. I just lay on the ground for a bit trying to roll in pain, but only managing a sort of wiggle. I also got my hand caught as we were going down and I was pretty sure I&apos;d broken my wrist since it hurt like a son of a bitch and I couldn&apos;t move my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing that I was seriously hurt, some people helped haul me back under the tent. That was nice of them. They then stole my pants which was not quite as nice. This makes the third time in the last month I&apos;ve ended up without my pants at a party, and the second I wasn&apos;t responsible for their removal. They were sopping wet and really cold, so I really wasn&apos;t all that concerned about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This left me just wearing a wife-beater and boxer briefs; both of which were soaked from my recent dip in the lake. Alcohol also slows blood circulation and it was getting a bit chilly. I curled my broken body up on a matela and lie there shivering for a bit. Someone brought the blanket from my room and I huddled under it. After a bit though a volunteer came over and started rubbing on my head. She told me everything was alright and if I was doing ok. After being lulled for a bit I felt another tug at my clothing. Someone was trying to steal my underwear. I was having nothing of this and responded with yet more cursing and flailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in my flailing someone pitched a bottle at me. In righteous retaliation I returned fire. More bottles followed and I responded as best I could. It was a bit difficult since I was mostly just aiming at the headlamps pointed at me around the room and it was at least six or seven to one. I must have been at least a little successful because the barrage escalated. Things that were particularly memorable were the half full can of Hawaii that didn&apos;t hurt, but soaked me in soda, and my phone which got me solidly in the jaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was clearly taking the whole lot of them single handedly they stepped it up once again and started throwing the furniture at me. The matelas were just big pieces of really thick foam rubber 8&apos;x3&apos;x2.5&apos;. After the first one caught and dazed me, the remaining seven or eight served to hold me down. The tables and chairs and flipcharts that followed were really just icing. I lie under the pile for a bit and considered my options. Since this evening was not going pretty well it made the most sense to just hide out. It had a comfy cave sort of feel. This would also entail me finding my way back to my room in the daylight mostly naked. So, I crawled out, unleashed one last bit of fury, but it was mediated since my left arm was unusable. Then I staggered off to my room where I lay shivering violently for half an hour because my cover had been taken out under the tent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning was supposedly really interesting for the staff. It looked like a typhoon had hit the tent. As they were cleaning they found my glasses and shirt that I&apos;d taken off. Then they found my phone which was covered in blood. I didn&apos;t realize it, but I&apos;d smashed my hand hard enough to both make a large blood blister and split it. When my phone was thrown at my head, my hand was still wet, and so my phone was well bloodied. Then they fished my pants out of the lake. Someone had returned then there once they took them from me. I think a quick headcount was done to verify that they didn&apos;t need to start dredging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for myself, I didn&apos;t make it to the 8am session or the 9am one either. I came dragging into the 10:00 looking a little ragged. I looked all the worse for not being able to put my hair back because I couldn&apos;t move my left thumb at all. All in all, I felt pretty shitty. As much as anything I was upset that I&apos;d been put in a situation where nothing happened, but I could easily have died. I know full well that I was far beyond swimming and I would have drowned if I had gone in the water. There is a certain trust in who you get drunk with, and I&apos;m still not sure how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a dream about a fellow in the States who had a distant Mauritanian relative die and leave him 100,000um. The guy is overjoyed and starts planning how he is going to buy a new car and take care of his debts. Then he finds out that 100,000um is worth about $300. Not nothing, but decidedly less than he had expected, and all the more disappointing because of his misjudgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m wondering if I don&apos;t deserve it though. I was pretty rude to a girl who was just trying to be nice to me. I also sort of asked for most of what happened to me. I was yelling pretty consistently and enjoying myself throughout the evening. Like with the bottles. I was throwing them back and taunting people. If I&apos;d have curled up in a little ball and they&apos;d have kept throwing them that would be another matter entirely. The fact that someone threw my pants in the water a second time pisses me off too. That was just mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main question right now is whether or not I was bad. I definitely need to say I&apos;m sorry to the girl who I yelled at and that I appreciate what she was trying to do and that I&apos;m not angry. I&apos;ve also apologized to the fellow I tackled, but he has use of both his hands and I still need to get mine x-rayed to see if it is broken. (I can move my thumb now though, after two days, so maybe I&apos;m fine.) I never really had any bad ideas, I just didn&apos;t always respond that well to things that happened. How much of the alternative is things being boring? It was definitely memorable if nothing else. &amp;#x263A; The sons of bitches that imperiled my life really should do something for me though I think.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>Are there any other volunteers who journal? I&apos;d really like to read this from the perspective of &quot;...and at the party there was this one guy&quot;.

I had been really, really un-entertained at the idea of working on my research this evening (despite having a meeting with my advisor tomorrow morning), but your tale sure raised my spirits.

				<body>You should look at my friends page. All the volunteers I know of with livejournals are there. Unfortunately they are all first years, I think, so none of them were there. There are other people with journals, but the links page is still down. I&apos;m really uncertain what to do. It has been a month and a half now and Elijah hasn&apos;t responded to my queries as to when he is going to bring everything back. How do you think he would respond to more consistent harassment? Is that a good idea?</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Question du jour: is it wrong to eat monkeys? I was visiting a volunteer who has a pet monkey and it inspired me and a friend to go on a monkey hunt. We have a village that has monkeys in its environs, and I found an article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wii.gov.in/envis/primates/downloads/page185tradi.pdf&quot;&gt;monkey trapping&lt;/a&gt;. It mentions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The poached adult is used for meat while the young are sold as pets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, monkeyburgers anyone? Not that we can likely catch a monkey, but just in case I want to have the morality of my options worked out. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>This topic actually came up in Matt&apos;s celebratory dinner last night.

Personally, I like a little consistency in that if I&apos;m going to lust after a big ole piece of cow meat then I can&apos;t rightfully disdain monkey meat just because the little guys are so darn cute.

Killing the adults and selling the young seems a little unkind though. A lot of the men in my family that I grew up around were hunters (and loved hunting), but at the same time they did have a loose set of morals that surrounded hunting that mainly centered on respect. They brought me to believe it is best to disturb the wild as little as possible. Knocking off a whole monkey family seems to go against that to some extent.</body>

			<event>Lesson for the day on how to not make popcorn. First is a basic physical property: the burning point of butter is apparently lower than that at which popcorn pops. So, if you were to melt a lot of butter to use in the place of oil, it will burn and smoke regardless of how much you stir it.

Caramel popcorn is a really tasty dish. If you take a bunch of sugar and butter and popcorn, and dump them all together in a pot, after a while the sugar will start to brown and combine with the butter to make tasty caramel. The problem comes shortly thereafter. Imagine, if you will, what is now a sea of molten sugar. In this sea are little unpopped popcorn mines. As these mines are detonated they spray molten sugar all over the place. This whole concoction, as I mentioned before, is already nearly ready to catch on fire, so it has to be continually stirred. With something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://directory.google.com/Top/Shopping/Food/Snacks/Popcorn/Kettle_Korn/&quot;&gt;kettle corn&lt;/a&gt;, it is stirred with a three foot long stick so as to avoid the flying sugar. If you are working in a more traditional environment, you are stirring with your hand about six inches above the flying sugar. My arms look like I got in fight with a little tiny army that attacked me with miniature shrapnel grenades. I&apos;ve got little blisters all over my hands because I was too stubborn to stop stirring just because it hurt like hell. I solaced myself with lots of screaming and cursing; something of a theme as of late.

The secondary problem though is that the popped popcorn cools down and causes the caramel to get tacky. As this happens the unpopped kernels start to stick to the popped stuff and you end up with a mass of a little popcorn and lots of kernels. So, lots of pain and an inedible product. Go me. &amp;#x263A;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Grumble&amp;hellip; Every single thing in my life sucks. Well, I&apos;m not sick right now. If I get hit by a car walking home from work today then that will pretty much top off my list of things that matter to me that aren&apos;t going well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, at COS conference I felt really bad because my friends mistreated me when I was drunk. Worse though was the bit with the girl. I&apos;ve never actually had a girl turn me down before. Not that I am that sexy, just that I don&apos;t ever breach the subject. I&apos;d not have done it with this girl; it was done by a friend. I know full well that I&apos;m a big dork and I&apos;m largely cool with it other than worrying girls won&apos;t be interested in me. Having a girl I liked straight up tell me she didn&apos;t find me attractive stung a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is also complete shit right now. The university locked me out of my lab without any warning. More importantly they locked all the stuff I was working on in the lab, so not only could I not work for them, I couldn&apos;t work on any of my other projects either. It is really damned frustrating to have all these different people calling me asking for my status and all I can say is, &quot;sorry, all my work is locked up right now.&quot; I&apos;ve been coming to the uni, but most of the administration is out on vacation including the one guy who can authorize freeing my stuff from the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&apos;ve been in a bit of a funk. Yesterday I was in bed for probably twenty of twenty-four hours. I just lay around and slept and read. There are days this is a fun comfy sort of activity. Yesterday was more of a depressed can&apos;t bear to face the world sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I get this email from my mom about her proposed trip to some out and see me in June:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Matt and I talked last night about our trip. We were thinking perhaps a trip to places other than Mauritania might be more fun. We want to have real fun on this trip and Mauritania just does not seem that enticing. We will be on a plane forever and I don&apos;t think Mauritania is really worth the effort.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in response to my message which said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Noooo! Please come. I was actually thinking about it today as I was walking to work. There is absolutely no way I can describe to you all what it is like being here. I want so badly for you to know what this is like. I already feel depressed thinking about coming home and that I&apos;ll not be able to talk to anyone about this place that has so dramatically altered me. I&apos;m not expecting it to get to you like it has me in two years, but it would really mean a lot if you would come.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I have unrealistic expectations as a son that me being here and telling her that it would mean a lot to me if she would come ought to at least count for a bit? I&apos;m not going to try and sell Mauritania as the most fascinating place ever, but I really do like it and I really think that it would be a neat trip. Do I not make it sound like it would be at least mildly interesting to come see me here? Goddammit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I&apos;m not going to beg her because I think if she is coming here with really high expectations for really exciting stuff, she is likely to be disappointed. This is desert life. It is fascinating culturally and aesthetically, but it isn&apos;t the Wild Africa ride at Disneyland. I can&apos;t promise her that kind experience. I just wish that someone from home had gotten to see this place with me before I left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m such a weenie anymore. Things just keep hurting my feelings. I remember long ago wishing to be more emotional and I seem to have gotten some of that. The only real repercussion is I spend lots of time sullen and injured. Oh well, so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>Now you know Sonja is a bit more of the Wild Africa ride at Disneyland than barren Sahara (beautiful and cultural as it is). Still I know it sucks to play the &quot;it would really mean a lot&quot; thing and get turned down.

Could you not kinda tour Africa and catch Mauritainia as well as maybe Morocco or some other more touristy place?</body>

				<subject>re: desert</subject>
				<body>Yeah, the trip I wanted to do was a really nice one: start out in Mauritania, then to Senegal and finish in Tunisia. That would have been five weeks though and she wanted to do two. That pretty much limits us to one country. Travel just takes too long here.

Her current mood is to go to Spain. The problem is money for me. It costs about as much to get to Spain from here as it does to get there from the States. I&apos;m planning on going through Spain on my way home. Doing it in June would mean spending money that could take me to Ghana. Choosing between seeing my family (who I&apos;ll see in a couple more months) and seeing Ghana is a tough call. The fact that they&apos;ve just snubbed my home makes it a little easier. &amp;#x263A;</body>

				<body>hrm... if one were trying to do a vacation on the cheap thing... how would the difference in airfare to get to mauritania -- as opposed to, say, europe -- play out?  (curious... not that it helps with getting family who prefer smoother vacations there.)</body>

				<subject>re: travel</subject>
				<body>People have done round trip New York to Casablanca for under $500 on Air Maroc. Getting to Europe is generally going to run you at least $400. Round trip on Air Maroc, Casa to Nouakchott, is $300, so the whole bit is under $1000.

The problem is her wanting it to be all pretty and laid out. I&apos;m more of an adventure sort of traveler at this point. As much as anything, it&apos;s because adventure&apos;s cheap and close at hand. If it sounds like it will leave me with a good story, I&apos;m all about it. At the end of the month, I get to go monkey hunting and mountain biking to waterfalls in the jungle. This entices me more than going to museums and eating in fancy restaurants.</body>

				<subject>Re: travel</subject>
				<body>I want to go monkey hunting and mountain biking to waterfalls in the jungle.  My friends and I plan insane weekend adventures but they seem fairly tame compared to travelling to Africa for adventure.  Though I suspect getting to Africa would take a little more planning than getting to Lower Alabama.

The problem with adventure travel is that the number of people who actually want to do it are few and far between.  And convincing them, you&apos;re not crazy for going is hard enough...  much less convincing them they should come along.  But with the people you love, you still want to share that part of your life with them so it&apos;s hard.

				<subject>For what its worth....</subject>
				<body>If I weren&apos;t so freaking poor I would come and visit you. I also don&apos;t have a passport or the shots. Although, I must admit that the opportunity to join the parasite-of-the-week club and engage in all the &quot;fun&quot; does sound appealing :).

Seriously, I wish I could come and visit, but I&apos;m not sure I could make a way. I barely make rent.

On the up side, we&apos;re starting a business. Paul Graham rejected us, but we&apos;re going to do it the old fashioned way, we&apos;re getting a day job. Wayne thinks that all you and I would do is argue with each other. He&apos;s probably right, but if we have enough code by the time you get back, you&apos;ll have to play at least a little nice :). Anyway, I&apos;ll keep you posted.</body>

If you all look like you&apos;re actually getting stuff together I&apos;d love to put in some time helping you. I&apos;d give you a couple months if you&apos;d give me a place to sleep. I can actually be useful when it comes right down to it. I&apos;ll not bitch about you being a dinosaur too much.</body>

				<body>I just said you had to play a little nice. And just how did I turn into an agent of the man? Do you not read about how I&apos;m getting screwed in grad school? Anyway...

Yeah, by the time you get here we should have lots of interesting things done :). I think you&apos;ll like it.

Actually, as to the future plans thing and grad school. I&apos;m curious, I know that you&apos;ve drastically affected my view of the Peace Corps and related topics(unfortunately, more negative than positive, nothing to do with you though...), I&apos;m curious how mine and Wayne&apos;s experience of grad school which you&apos;ve gotten remotely has affected your view? Oh yeah, I&apos;m going to write up a to do/wish I&apos;d known list for grad students here in a bit(some new grad students were asking me some stuff and I figured I would just put it on the web for all to read... after I have my diploma in hand...).

			<event>Well, I&apos;m in my lab, but they&apos;ve disconnected the internet. Just to make sure I don&apos;t get too happy; they have locked me out of my office where there is internet. What I did to make them hate me I&apos;m not sure, but that they want me to suffer is the answer that makes the most sense. Whatever they do it is the most inconvenient thing&amp;hellip;

So I have not posted since I&apos;m only online for an hour or so at night. I&apos;ll be even more sporadic as I leave tomorrow to do some work in Aioun and try to fix their DSL connection which is broken in a way that I have no experience in fixing. I&apos;m the biggest geek around though, so off I go.

After this it is off to Senegal with me. Gonna try and catch some monkeys and see a hippo. Hopefully there will be internet occasionally and I&apos;ll do the whole travelogue thing.

Off now for one last dance.</event>

No internet for two weeks though. Now in Saint Louis for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saintlouisjazz.com&quot;&gt;Jazz Fest&lt;/a&gt;. Can&apos;t type really well here, so a more in depth entry will be forthcoming&amp;hellip;</event>

Perhaps you might have had better luck catching monkeys if you could lure them with bananas.  Have you perfected your banana throwing technique since college?  ;)

Hope it was a good trip...</body>

				<subject>re: Glad to have you back</subject>
				<body>Alas, my puisance is not much improved. As it is, bananas would have unfortunately required me to get within 50 feet of the monkey and we were never even close to that. We&apos;d see them off in the bush, but they&apos;d disappear as soon as we got close. Some kids had one treed, but it was a huge thorn tree and you could hardly see the monkey, let alone spear it.

I was talking to someone from Guinea as I was traveling, and they told me monkeys are eaten down that way. I&apos;m hoping to take a trip down that way, so perhaps monkeyburgers will still happen one day.</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I am home once again. The road to get me here has been a long one. I&apos;m gonna try and recount it. Unfortunately the only thing my memory is renowned for is its feebleness. Well, no harm in trying&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%; border: thin solid; border-collapse: collapse&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/04/17&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Nouakchott&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Kiffa&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;7.5hr&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;0um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Kiffa&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;About two years ago now a $80,000 computer center went into the high school in Aioun as part of a project with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eddionline.org&quot; title=&quot;Education for Development and Democracy Initiative&quot;&gt;EDDI&lt;/a&gt;. Their internet connection went mysteriously dead about four months ago and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mauritel.mr&quot;&gt;Mauritel&lt;/a&gt; claims it is not their fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The thing is that for it to not be their fault, the configuration on the router would need to have changed. A router is a pretty simple piece of equipment. For it to up and spontaneously change its configuration with no external influence is highly unlikely. More than likely the problem is coming from the telco. The problem is that I am completely unfamiliar with how exactly to prove that. And prove that I need to do, because as it is, they claim that it is our fault and therefore owe them for the nonworking line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I hunted around town for someone who could help me understand what I needed to do, but to no avail. I found some stuff on the internet, but it all required equipment I didn&apos;t have access to. Even though I didn&apos;t really know what I was doing, as resident geek it was my responsibility to go, so off I went. I was lucky enough to catch a ride with a Peace Corps mission headed that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I spend the day chatting with the new SED APCD and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://exchanges.state.gov/education/fulbright/&quot;&gt;Fulbright&lt;/a&gt; doing research on the effectiveness of different aid methods. They proved pretty entertaining and the nice air conditioned 4x4 even more so. We arrived in the evening in Kiffa to some lovely stew and brownies prepared by the volunteers. (Another perk of traveling with bureau staff.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After a congenial night of 80&apos;s music and conversation we retired to the roof. Roof access is by way of freakishly steep stairway that did serious damage to my shins every time I attempted to scale it. Fortunately, I was not adversely affected by the change in water and lasted the night without having to descend the thing in haste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%; border: thin solid; border-collapse: collapse&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/04/18&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Kiffa&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Aioun&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;4.5hr&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2000um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Aioun&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Bright and early the next morning Fulbright Kristen and I headed off for Aioun. She needed to do some checking for her project and I needed to start playing with the internet. Leaving was lots of fun. We got the garage and asked the guy how many people were left to fill the car. &quot;Just two,&quot; he replied, with an indistinct wave when asked where the others were. We told him that if he got the others and loaded the car, then we&apos;d give him our money. He grumbled a bit and wandered off. Then we talked to someone else who was also &quot;pret à partir,&quot; but who couldn&apos;t produce his phantom passengers. We made a general announcement that we&apos;d take two places in the first car ready to go and went to sit down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;About twenty minutes later a third guy left with only us in the hopes of picking up passengers. This is not a bad plan. Mauritanians are still a fairly nomadic people and there are little settlements scattered all over the place. No one owns a car, so people just come and sit by the road and hitch when they want to get into town. Our Mercedes had the requisite six people for about 90% of the voyage. Also, I don&apos;t know if it is in punishment for being major supporters in the last coup or what, but the road between Kiffa and Aioun is one of the worst I&apos;ve been on. We drove on the sand beside the road most of the way because it was smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I spent my day playing around at the lycee not really knowing what I was doing. I did fix a couple software problems and poking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://commerce.patton.com/pe_products.asp?category=18&quot;&gt;modem&lt;/a&gt; and router, but to no real avail. I got the manufacturer and model number off of it, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://patton.com&quot;&gt;Patton&apos;s site&lt;/a&gt; was down. So, I retired back to Hector and Genny&apos;s largely defeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The next morning, the crew that we&apos;d left behind in Kiffa caught up and we did breakfast for them. We&apos;ve got a volunteer in Rosso working on a charcoal production. My brief stint as pancake chef proved I could likely show him a thing or two. I was quickly relieved and set to reposing on a matela where I was less likely to do myself or our repast any harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;My day was spent hanging out with Jarad and trying to figure the internet bit out. No luck though. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gtz.de&quot;&gt;GTZ&lt;/a&gt; had a working connection and we went by to see if they&apos;d let us look at it to get some info on the settings. Unfortunately the next day was Mohammed&apos;s birthday and their IT guy was out of town for the long weekend. So, I left Jarad with a list of questions for the guy, fixed GTZ&apos;s printer, installed some nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rosettastone.com&quot;&gt;language software&lt;/a&gt; and called it a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%; border: thin solid; border-collapse: collapse&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot; rowspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;2005/04/20&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Boghé Dow&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;.5hr&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;250um / 2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Boghé&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The next morning we got up and headed back toward Nouakchott. I got off in Aleg and headed South to Boghé. I was planning on spending some time looking at some computers and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/29334.html&quot;&gt;monkey hunting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Monkey hunt was unsuccessful despite my expertly carved spear. Even the computer fixing didn&apos;t work out. The machine was an old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dell.com&quot;&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; server with a SCSI controller I couldn&apos;t get to boot from a CD. So, a frustrating time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I did manage to watch fifteen movies over the course of four days between Aioun and Boghé. &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0316654/&quot;&gt;Spiderman 2&lt;/a&gt; was as good as the first I thought. &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0362227/&quot;&gt;The Terminal&lt;/a&gt; was a bit idealized, but if I accepted it as such it was entertaining. &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0372183/&quot;&gt;The Bourne Supremacy&lt;/a&gt; didn&apos;t really grab me. &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0343818/&quot;&gt;I, Robot&lt;/a&gt; did. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0247745/&quot;&gt;Super Troopers&lt;/a&gt; I found quite entertaining. I was surprised I&apos;d never heard of it before coming here.&lt;/p&gt;

			<event>I&apos;ve been learning some basic physiology lessons in the last few days. First lesson was that a sharp force, like a kick, applied to an existing cut, can cause the flesh to split. Second lesson is that the reason we put stitches in split flesh is because they will continue to split if put under stress. Third is that if you have splitting flesh and you don&apos;t get it stitched relatively recently after splitting it, it starts to heal over and you can&apos;t get it stitched.

Just call me gimp. Or dumb. Either is appropriate.</event>

			<subject>Trip Logue</subject>
			<event>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After some more days of lounging around the house recovering from a cold, I am back in my lab at the uni. I&apos;ve even got internet again. If the damned &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; were but up, I&apos;d be trés content. I want to get some more memories from this trip down before I forget it all&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Orossogui&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;5.5hr&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;1500cfa&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2400cfa&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Dodel&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After my not terribly productive days in Boghé, Dan and I headed off into Senegal to begin our trip. The first part we had done before on a booze smuggling run. You cross the river and then you catch a horse cart which carries you into Senegal. The river is divided at this point though, so you have to cross it three times. The most interesting crossing is the middle one. You cross in a canoe made out of a hollowed out palm tree. They roll the back axle of the horse cart up onto the canoe and the horse swims along beside the boat as you cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Once we arrived in Dodel we had to try and catch a car. Unfortunately it was the middle of the day and in addition to being hot as hell, there were no cars coming our way. We lay in the sun and napped for a couple hours before something finally showed up. I was reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060586540/mentorreadingsug/&quot;&gt;The Great Short Works of Herman Melville&lt;/a&gt;, so dropping off was no problem for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Eventually a bus stopped by and took us to Orossogui, the next big town. We were dropped at the garage where we asked which would be the next car to leave and were directed to a little minibus. The minibus was indeed the next car to leave. The minibus also then stopped every ten to fifteen minutes for the next four hours. I was exhausted and pretty much comatose in the back. Eventually the driver got tired of driving about eighty kilometers from our destination and stopped for the night. Dan was just about ready to kick his ass. I just curled up in a little ball on the back seat and slept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After some yelling and Dan&apos;s threat (which is apparently common in Pulaar) of &quot;I&apos;m going to beat you till you&apos;re dead.&quot; It was apparent that we weren&apos;t going anywhere. In a daze I wandered out of the bus and fell back asleep on a matela on the side of the road. I got a couple hours of sleep to be awakened rather rudely by the bus driver slapping me in the head telling me we were going to go. Apparently Dan&apos;s threat on his life was not well recieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%; border: thin solid; border-collapse: collapse&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/04/24&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Tchnaf&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Bakel&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;1hr&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;0cfa&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Bakel&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We arrived in Bakel nice and early. The bus driver sold us to a normal sept place, and that car carried us all the way into town. We wanted to catch up with Nate at this point so after unsuccessfully trying to buy an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alize.sn&quot;&gt;Alizé&lt;/a&gt; sim card we headed to the border. We sat ourselves down and both promptly fell asleep. After half an hour or so I woke up and noted that a camion had arrived and there were literally thousands of liters of vegetable oil in 20 liter bidons being rolled down the hill and carted across the river. I also noted that there was a pirogue full of people on its way across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;When the fellow in charge was queried as to why we weren&apos;t a part of this pirogue full of people, he replied that &quot;il faut parler&quot; if we wanted to cross. We figured he&apos;d know that us white boys with backpacks hadn&apos;t just come to the river to watch the boats, but we were wrong. After we parled a bit and made our intentions clear we were soon on our way across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Gouré was hot as hell. We mostly laid around all day in a stupor. Nate had a little spritzer bottle that provided brief periods of respite, but mostly we just lay around trying not to melt. I did learn the meaning of going to the valley and it was therein that I spent the majority of the day. I did learn an entertaining bit of Sonike, spoken by Nate of his pet to his warring host-siblings, &quot;stop throwing the monkey.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We headed over to find some internet and food. Instead we found beer and the end of a wrestling match. So, everything worked out alright. Dan and Nate had both been in fraternities, so they regaled me with tales of their various exploits as we sat around. I&apos;ve never been to a frat party since I never figured I was cool enough. I guess since I&apos;d be all scared and quiet, I probably wouldn&apos;t have been cool enough. Maybe if I go to grad school I might get the chance. They made it sound like a really fun time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;For the evening we were going to do the radio show again, so we wandered back across the river. The plan was to stay up all night and catch the bus in the morning. I was still exhausted from the night before sleeping on the side of the road. So, it seemed a questionable idea to me, but if the others were feeling energetic, I was in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The problem was that the radio station wanted something quieter for Sunday night and wanted to switch the show to Friday night. It would be a step up since there were more listeners and it was unarguable that us drunk and singing on the radio wasn&apos;t exactly easy listening. He said that if we hung around til 2am he&apos;d put us on. We decided to wander out and do some drinking, and see how things worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Have you ever had whiskey that was about the temperature of hot tea? I don&apos;t know if this is true of all whiskeys, but the cheap Senegalese swill that we shot nearly made all three of us throw up. For me that isn&apos;t saying much, but Dan can drink the stuff like it&apos;s water and it even turned his stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After a few drinks and no real sensory input, I started to crash. I headed back to their crash pad which looks more like a Taiwanese crack house than anywhere I&apos;ve seen in my life (never having been to Taiwan). I fell asleep on one of the two tiny dirty matelas and made sure to put my head away from the corner where Conquest (another volunteer and a story unto himself) has been known to relieve himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Throughout the evening, I had been entertaining myself by pretending to be a Senegalese suitor and sending messages to Leah trying to get her to respond. It never did work out at all. I looked back over my messages the next day and her unresponsiveness may have resulted from my vehemence. I started out with normal introductions and salutations. By the end of the evening, I was comparing her eyes to the moon on the waves, her lips to strawberries and her hair to caramel. I later asked why she hadn&apos;t responded, and in addition to her being asleep when the the messages were sent at 3:30am, the only ones she got were the final complementary ones and none of the initial explanatory ones. It was a fun game to tax my French, in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;A couple hours after I crashed, Dan and Nate wandered in discussing the vagaries of masturbation. I was passing in and out of consciousness catching bits and pieces on methods and frequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

			<subject>Immolation</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m home again for a bit and am going to try being productive and not leaving town until the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lexicorient.com/mauritania/terjit.htm&quot;&gt;Terjit&lt;/a&gt; party in the middle of next month. Me being flat broke and a month behind on my rent also helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to sort of use the time as a period of reflection and focusing. Granted, I have in the past wanted to have a period of reflection and focusing, and generally just managed to have a period of lazing about and doing fuck all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure I ought to have better luck with it if I have some sort of reward worked in. I mean, I like inner peace and all that jazz, but it&apos;s amorphous and hard to gage. Pretty much the only time I managed to consistently go to the gym here was leading up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/25890.html&quot;&gt;WAIST&lt;/a&gt;. It was the possibility that being fitter would make it more likely that someone would make out with me that motivated me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I want in my life right now? The big things that are lacking are a sense of professional direction and general loneliness. I&apos;m expecting to be pretty busy with projects and whenever I get busy, I tend to kill time with productive, but not important things. For instance, today I was supposed to be finishing &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/ecodev.mr/&quot;&gt;EcoDev&apos;s site&lt;/a&gt;, but instead blew three hours reworking &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/julbrew.gm/&quot;&gt;JulBrew&apos;s&lt;/a&gt;. So, I&apos;m pretty sure that I&apos;ll get my &lt;a href=&quot;http://resume.himinbi.org&quot;&gt;résumé&lt;/a&gt; redone and that&apos;s the next big thing on my professional timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves the loneliness bit. Hmm, what to do there? Well, the emotional stuff I need another person for. That leaves the physical. Intriguing. &amp;#x263A; What sorts of things would a person do to get in top shape for lovin&apos;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What goes into good sex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensuality:&lt;/strong&gt; Being able to let go and get caught up in the experience. You just let the world drop away except for the experience of the moment. The only prep I know for this one is &lt;strong&gt;meditation&lt;/strong&gt;. For me it is at least a month of fifteen to twenty minutes daily before I&apos;m even starting to be able to really focus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness:&lt;/strong&gt; Depending on the pace and style, sex can be pretty demanding both from a strength and cardiovascular standpoint. How do you develop that? Go to the &lt;strong&gt;gym&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attractiveness:&lt;/strong&gt; Sex is more fun when you&apos;re comfortable. You&apos;ve got to be happy with your body in order to feel comfortable. This is two pronged in that you&apos;ve got to accept yourself, which the meditation helps with, but that self-acceptance is simpler if you&apos;ve put work into how you look. That means the gym and following a &lt;strong&gt;diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pubococcygeus:&lt;/strong&gt; Much like Kegels for women, men can exercise the musculature involved in sexual intercourse. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.askmen.com/love/love_tip_60/67_love_tip.html&quot;&gt;Exercises&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to increase depth of feeling, staying power and, for some guys, enable multiple orgasms. How much truth there is, I can&apos;t say, but it certainly sounds interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s all I can come up with. Anyone else have any ideas? I suppose getting rich or learning to be funny would increase my chances of actually getting to put the stuff into practice. As for actual functional stuff is there anything else? I don&apos;t think drinking has any significant effect on sexual performance (other than while actually intoxicated). So, I don&apos;t think detoxing would help. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the opportunity to use these traits? Well, I&apos;ve tried (and failed) half a dozen times to start meditating again since I&apos;ve been here. I&apos;ll wait till I&apos;ve got the powers before worrying as to their use. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;hellip;The Cambodian Government allowed the fight to take place, under the condition that they receive a 50% commission on each ticket sold, and that no cameras would be allowed in the arena.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fight was called in only 12 minutes, after which 28 fighters were declared dead, while the other 14 suffered severe injuries including broken bones and lost limbs, rendering them unable to fight back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</event>

			<subject>Voyage</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of my trip to Senegal, as recounted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/30527.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/31148.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid ; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/04/25&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;3000cfa&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Tamba&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We had reserved bus tickets the night before. We got up at about 5:30, after a good half hour of sleep for Dan. We drug ourselves over to the gas station where the bus was to pick us up. Dan promptly lay down on the ground and fell asleep. After a bit some guys wandered over and spread out a mat, so Dan then rolled over onto it and fell back asleep. What he didn&apos;t realize is this was the mat for people to pray on, so his drunken form was soon surrounded on all sides by people praising the name of Allah and touching their foreheads to the ground. It was quite a picture. Go America. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Our ride was a big greyhound style bus. This is the first time I&apos;ve seen one in Senegal. The fellow called our names and we got on in the order that we&apos;d signed up. Thankfully, Dan and I were early enough on the list to get read seats rather than having to sit on the boxes laid out in the isle to add a fifth seat to each row. Unfortunately, we only got to enjoy our seats for an hour since that&apos;s how long the bus went before breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We were about 30 minutes out from the nearest town. Dan and I figured we&apos;d hang around and see if they could fix the bus since they&apos;d started the thing to pull it off the road. After about an hour as it neared 10am, the temperature climbed near 95&amp;deg;, and the mechanics pulled the radiator out; we decided to abandon our bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;As a group, the sixty or so people on the bus were all relying on hitching rides with passing cars to leave. Senegalese are less judicious in their cramming than Mauritanians, but few cars had much available space at all. When Dan and I finally made it out, we were in a minibus with 34 other people. I had one leg hanging out the back door and Dan was standing on the rear bumper. Apparently the bumper wasn&apos;t comfortable because Dan started climbing up on the roof. This upset the baggage guy. He told Dan in no uncertain terms that he couldn&apos;t go on the roof. &quot;Ok, ok, I understand,&quot; said Dan as he climbed up on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Apparently Dan curled up and fell asleep on the roof and after another couple hours we rolled into Tambacounda. A quick 250cfa cab ride got us to the Peace Corps house. It was there that we met up with the ladies who were to be our guides for the next leg of our journey: Kim and Naomi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Kim and I got to know each other a bit after her unfortunate run in with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/23492.html&quot;&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; a couple months back. She is one of the coolest girls I&apos;ve met in Peace Corps. Her initial quietness hides a surprising depth and drive. In her own words she is: independent, crafty and a huntress (though a vegetarian, so broccoli beware). These characteristics line up well with the fox which is both her totem and tattooed across the small of her back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Naomi I met when I enlisted her help at WAIST to try and convince Leah to partake in nap time. She is one of those people who simply puts you at ease with her vivacity and genuineness. She has no totem herself and a discussion on the subject did little other than to firmly establish that she isn&apos;t an owl. I personally am going to vote something hearty and playful. Maybe a bear. She is good natured, which is fortunate since with her rugby player&apos;s stature she could whoop some ass were she not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Dan, the monkey, and myself, who is unnamed arrived to Tamba house as &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0357413/&quot;&gt;Anchorman&lt;/a&gt; was being started. I&apos;ve now seen two movies with Kim, both of them being Anchorman. We had a bite to eat and a few licks of brownie batter, and we were out the door again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid ; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Diallo Koto&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;1.5hr&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;700cfa&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Diallo Koto&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We loaded up in a truck for the next bit of our voyage. Dan must have been pretty tired since he proceeded directly to pass out and roll first into a little ball and then into Kim&apos;s lap. She corrected him with an occasional slap in the head, but he was persistent. Inspired by Dan&apos;s altered state, the conversation turned to matters of illicit substances. We were, of course, all pure as the driven snow, but we did swap stories of things we&apos;d heard our friends had tried. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Once we got to Diallo Koto, we set to provisioning ourselves for the night. The bread and eggs came readily. The mayonnaise that Naomi ordered up took a little longer to prepare. She was nearly left behind, but lots of yelling and arm waving got the driver to await her arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;0cfa&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Dar Salam&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Dar Salam is right at the entrance to &lt;a href=&quot;http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=153&quot;&gt;Nikolo Koba&lt;/a&gt; where we were headed to do our wildlife watching. The contact between Dar Salam and the hotel is three times a day via radio. We had already missed the third contact and so it was not possible to have the hotel send someone out to get us. So, we decided to pass the night at the home of an ecotourism volunteer who lives in Dar Salam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I never met Molly, as she was not at home. All I can venture is that she is a fan of monkeys, as several stuffed approximations adorned her hut, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jhome/34629&quot;&gt;American Journal of Primatology&lt;/a&gt; was beside the bed and a quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553375407/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;Ishmael&lt;/a&gt; was on the wall. Fortunately, our arrival was expected and the key was with a friend in the village. We went and had some fish balls for dinner with the family, pulled water, got clean and headed to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</event>

				<subject>re: Totem</subject>
				<body>Kim already had her totem which she had for several years. I asked her how she got it and she said just reading about different archetypal animal qualities and then thinking on it.

Some people, like Dan, just clearly say &quot;monkey&quot; when you look at them. Others are more difficult. I&apos;m still really not sure what mine is. It seems like having one would sort of give your an archetype to center your self image around. While I suppose it could be limiting, I can see where it could give you a certain strength as well.

I think that&apos;s my problem, I&apos;m skittish about committing to any one way of being.</body>

				<body>Yeah, I wish I could. I don&apos;t have a camera anymore and so I rely on the good graces of others to get shots. All three of my companions had cameras, so perhaps I&apos;ll be able to go back through and put in some shots later.</body>

			<subject>Reconnaissance des Visages</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Human beings have an amazing ability to recall and recognize &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.face-rec.org&quot;&gt;faces&lt;/a&gt;. As highly social animals, we are sensitive to minute changes in the facial musculature as cues to emotional state and intent. There is an area of the temporal lobe called the fusiform face area that is only active in the recognition of faces. We can see houses, cars and camels, but the FFA only works when we are looking at a face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our speed and perspicuity in face recognition makes realistic representation of faces one of the more difficult tasks to undertake in art. Similarly the editing of images of faces is a pain. Which brings me to my project for the morning. I&apos;ve been converting some pictures from another volunteer to a form suitable for use in a presentation, but some of them needed editing. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Mark, Erin and Will&quot;&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; alt=&quot;Red Eyed Volunteers&quot; src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/albums/bismillah/mark_erin_and_will.sized.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a good shot and there are a couple stories that involve Mark, Erin and I, so I like us together. The problems are the eyes. Mine and Erin&apos;s being quite red and Mark working the dazed look. Fixing the redeye is not too bad. Fixing Mark is a different problem though. I just can&apos;t seem to get both the eyes looking the same way. It is a real pain, but I still think that lazy eyed is a better look for him than stoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

It came out as expected. I&apos;ve been noticing feeling both &lt;a href=&quot;http://changingminds.org/explanations/preferences/extravert_introvert.htm#Internal&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://changingminds.org/explanations/preferences/thinking_feeling.htm#Feeling&quot;&gt;F&lt;/a&gt; as of late. I&apos;m always &lt;a href=&quot;http://changingminds.org/explanations/preferences/sensing_intuiting.htm#Intuiting&quot;&gt;N&lt;/a&gt;, and my number of ongoing projects (seven) versus completed projects in the last two weeks (zero) can attest to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://changingminds.org/explanations/preferences/judging_perceiving.htm#Perceiving&quot;&gt;P&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I found interesting on okcupid is in breaks down &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=8004480526343419820&quot;&gt;test results&lt;/a&gt; by demographics and tells you how you relate to others of your age and sex. Unfortunately that information is only available right after you take it and my damned browser crashed. You can still get a comparison, but it is now against the entire population. (I&apos;m assuming, it says &quot;other people&quot; for who it is compared to.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 90%; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;I-E&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;width: 90%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div style=&quot;float: left; height: 100%; width: 51%; background-color: blue; color: white; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;51%&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;N-S&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;width: 90%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div style=&quot;float: left; height: 100%; width: 1%; background-color: blue; color: white; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;1%&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;F-T&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;width: 90%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div style=&quot;float: left; height: 100%; width: 9%; background-color: blue; color: white; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;9%&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;J-P&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;width: 90%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div style=&quot;float: left; height: 100%; width: 83%; background-color: blue; color: white; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;83%&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That looks about right. Especially the 1% on the N. I only know a handful of people who might be as intuitive as me, &lt;lj user=&quot;madmaddy123&quot;&gt; being one of them. The only thing that confuses me is the percentile on T-F. It looks like it is saying that I was in the 9th percentile for Fs, but 86% is a pretty strong preference and I really can&apos;t imagine it being that low. My only guess is that this is a demographic profile and I&apos;m more emotionally inclined than 91% of their young white male respondants.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Épreuve des Fatayers</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;This past Wednesday, May 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcafrica/africa05/&quot;&gt;Africa Day&lt;/a&gt;. It is a celebration of the various African nations&apos; independence from colonial rule and marks the day in 1963 when the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0836842.html&quot;&gt;Organization of African Unity&lt;/a&gt; was formed. The &lt;acronym title=&quot;Organization of African Unity&quot;&gt;OAU&lt;/acronym&gt; has since become just the &lt;acronym title=&quot;African Union&quot;&gt;AU&lt;/acronym&gt;, but we&apos;ve still got the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School was out and the Peace Corps bureau was closed in celebration. So, seeking to find an activity that properly embraced the Africa Day ideals of freedom, liberty and self-determination, we decided to have a fatayer eating contest. Fatayers are a magical food that, much like the peoples of Africa, come in a variety of shapes and sizes. What unifies them all together is their ground meat filling and fried doughy exterior. The meat can be camel or goat or even beef. The bread might be light and fluffy or dense or crispy and flaky. It all makes no difference; if there is meat, bread and frying: you&apos;ve got a fatayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particular fatayers for our challenge were from Snak Irak. The dough is fairly light, about the consistency of a hotdog bun. The meat is goat, I think. Triangular, about four inches on a side and at about a pound of well-greased heft; they are a hearty meal. They are sort of big though and a bit intimidating, so we only had three contestants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weighing in at 75kg, from Birmingham, Alabama the wily and devious &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcvalentin.smugmug.com&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;Marc &apos;Fuck Atkins&apos; Valentin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weighing in at 85kg, from San Francisco, California the burly and boisterous &lt;a href=&quot;http://dunsmore-eidson.smugmug.com/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;Scott &apos;Deal-a-Meal&apos; Eidson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weighing in at 80kg, from Bluff City, Tennessee, the enigmatic and reserved &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.himinbi.org&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;Will &apos;Mikey&apos; Holcomb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Sooo Many Fatayers&amp;hellip;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going in, Scott was the favorite. He&apos;s got a solid build and a hearty appetite. In an unfortunate planning strategy gone awry however, he ate a fairly large breakfast mere hours before the contest was to begin. Whether this would impair him to the point of allowing Marc or myself to taking him was highly questionable however. I myself was something of a wildcard. I am a renowned eater, but more so based on a lack of discrimination rather than quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules were simple and sixfold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Winner is whoever eats the most&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Puking disqualifies you unless you reconsume it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Counting is done in half fatayer increments (you can&apos;t win by a single bite)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a one hour time limit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the case of a tie after an hour it goes to bite for bite sudden death&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Losers buy the winners food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all started out strong. The fatayers come out freshly microwaved and piping hot with your choice of condiments. Marc went with the traditional ketchup and mayonnaise, while Scott was a bit spicier with mustard and mayo, and I went spartan with just ketchup and a bit of mayo on the side if they got too dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; alt=&quot;Starting Out Strong&quot; src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/albums/fatayers/going_strong.sized.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc was the first to drop out. He made it through three, but by that time Scott had a half a fatayer lead and I had a whole one, so he dropped out. Another couple fatayers later I had widened my lead to a full two over Scott. He was at four and I was at six. He knew he could make it to six, but didn&apos;t think he could do seven. He doubted my resolve though and so tried for the fifth forcing me to do the seventh to maintain my lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, each one of these things weighs about a pound. I&apos;d already eaten six. Laughing was starting to hurt because my stomach was pushing out so much. The seventh was a challenge. Swallowing got sort of difficult. The mechanism just stopped working. Some part of my brain was desperately trying to halt the influx of fatayers into the system. In the end though, mind won out over body and I got the seventh down. Scott made it through his fifth, but he would need two and a half more to beat me and he threw in the towel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was there that we ended:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In celebration of a contest well-played (and a diet completely fucked), we went out for ice cream. I figured I&apos;d splurge since I&apos;d just saved myself $3.50. (Fatayers are 150um (50¢) apiece, so my winning 3kg of fatayers was 1050um ($3.50). It was a cheap contest.) So, I got myself two ice cream bars in an attempt to add balance my diet of fat with a little sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t really remember much of the rest of the afternoon. I went home and lie about in a fatayer induced stupor. I eventually passed out wondering if there is a version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trainharder.com/training/articles/overhydration.htm&quot;&gt;hyponatremia&lt;/a&gt; where your blood gets so much grease in it that it solidifies. I awoke to some minor gastrointestinal distress, but nothing worse than the cramps from eating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/32798.html&quot;&gt;pepto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re really bad, I&apos;m pretty sure you either come back as Marc&apos;s liver or my stomach. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>They really are tasty. I&apos;d eat one for supper tonight if not for the the fact I&apos;m now on a diet. I&apos;m trying to offset the fact that I consumed about 80,000 calories in an hour.</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of cheating on the part of some of the contestants in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/33907.html&quot;&gt;fatayer challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Namely, some of us, myself included, were high as kites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked really well. I had the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.straightdope.com/columns/030516.html&quot;&gt;munchies&lt;/a&gt; by the time it started and I was completely spacing out. The process was a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;attention wanders&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&quot;Oh look! I&apos;ve got a fatayer! I love fatayers!&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;take a bite of fatayer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&quot;Mmmm, yum. Fatayers are so tasty. Tasty tasty meat puffs&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;repeat from #1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t really remember eating fatayers three through six. I only really know I ate seven because I was told so by spectators. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Project for the day involves interacting with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flash/&quot;&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt; movie from Javascript. In the process of searching for how to do it I found a neat example. I&apos;m pretty sure the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.org&quot;&gt;livejournal link cleaner&lt;/a&gt; will eat &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:window.open(&apos;http://www.next-in.com/site/html/kickers.html&apos;,&apos;Men%20v.%20Browser&apos;,&apos;toolbar=no,resizable=no,scrollbars=no,left=&apos;+(document.width/2)+&apos;px,top=&apos;+(document.height/2)+&apos;,width=300px,height=165px&apos;).focus()&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, so instead paste this long link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;javascript:window.open(&apos;http://www.next-in.com/site/html/kickers.html&apos;,&apos;Men%20v.%20Browser&apos;,&apos;toolbar=no,resizable=no,scrollbars=no,left=&apos;+(document.width/2)+&apos;px,top=300px,width=300px,height=165px&apos;).focus()&lt;/code&gt;

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Well, we got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/ecodev.mr/&quot;&gt;EcoDev page&lt;/a&gt; done today. I&apos;ve been working on it with another volunteer for about a month now. It feels good to be able to check a project off the list. That doesn&apos;t happen all that often. I&apos;ve worked about twenty four hours in the previous two days on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/miriam/bismillah/&quot;&gt;slideshow&lt;/a&gt; project, but it still doesn&apos;t work. I want to get it going for our new invitees who are coming in next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&apos;m going to hang around a bit longer, but try to avoid leaving at 2&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;am&lt;/span&gt;, like the last two nights. Being at work all the time has made me quite anti-social as of late. I&apos;ve been feeling productive though and I hate to waste it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anywho, back to work&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>I don&apos;t know if you want problem feedback or not but I checked out the page with Firefox 1.0 and the Financable Projects and References links are stomping on each other.  (The word References and Projects are overlaid and I figure out what they said by highlighting them.)

I think the page looks great regardless...  I wish I would take the time to learn that kind of web stuff.  Just don&apos;t have spare time for that right now.</body>

				<body>Hmm, I developed it in Mozilla 1.7 on a Linux box and tested it on Mozilla 1.6 and IE6 on a Windows box. Strange that Firefox would have problems with it...

Double hmm, when I try Firefox 1.0.4 I&apos;m not having the problem. I bet what it is has to do with the font you are using to display. It is likely wider and causing the line to wrap. I&apos;ll have to play a bit and figure out how to fix it.

Thanks though for the heads up.</body>

			<event>Mauritania has been moving quite a bit in the last couple days.

The big news here is that an Islamic group in Algeria thought we weren&apos;t Islamic enough and came over and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2005/6/5/latest/20050605214838&amp;sec=Latest&quot;&gt;killed 15 of our soldiers&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve not been able to find any reports of it online, but supposedly they were all beheaded.

Mauritania catches a lot of grief for being not Islamic enough. Maybe the &quot;Islamic Republic&quot; thing sets the bar too high. People complain of us having &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/14D039ED-B4D3-4843-9FF8-A76DFFED8460.htm&quot;&gt;diplomatic ties to Israel&lt;/a&gt;. The Israeli embassy just put out a huge (10&apos;) flag, which I thought was a bit ostentatious, but what they hey. Also, them being friendly with us is not popular with much of the Western world. I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9D7C7248-F3D6-4631-8A8B-C6F157997F8E.htm&quot;&gt;this Ajazeera article&lt;/a&gt; bearing the damning caption, &quot;Maaouya Ould Taya is a staunch American ally.&quot; (They misspelt Maaouiya.)

I&apos;ve been hearing rumors of Mauritania heading up through Mali to retaliate, but I can&apos;t find any news of it. I&apos;ll have to buy a paper on my way home.

Things have been a little more active than normal. The students wander around yelling from time to time now, and there&apos;s a definite rise in graffiti. It&apos;s all in Arabic though, so I&apos;ve got no real clue what it&apos;s about. There was a big protest march tonight and several of my students couldn&apos;t get to class because the roads were blocked off. I need to find out what exactly was being protested. I think the marches against our change to a Saturday/Sunday (from Friday/Saturday which it was since the 70&apos;s) have finally tapered off. People are like the French here. You&apos;ve got to seriously piss Americans off before they take to the streets and start wandering around waving signs. You just need some bad croissants to get the French up in arms.

I don&apos;t want to make it sound like things are going crazy or anything. They&apos;re not. People are all still really friendly to me and I get lots of &quot;American good&quot; responses to queries as to my nationality. As is often the case it is a small group of vocal people causing trouble. It just makes for good gossip.</event>

			<event>I&apos;m almost finished with a project. For some reason my capacity to focus is proportional to my distance from completion. That means that I&apos;ve been mostly surfing the web today and doing a little programming. It is always something tangentially related, but not productive.

For instance, I just got through reading a very interesting slideshow (I&apos;m working on a HTML &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/miriam/bismillah/&quot;&gt;slideshow&lt;/a&gt;) about the neurochemical processes involved in &lt;a href=&quot;http://dancesafe.org/slideshow/&quot;&gt;taking ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;. It is something I&apos;ve been interested in because I know some people who are convinced that it&apos;ll eat your brain while others consider it is a pretty safe drug. I&apos;m wary about doing something that might eat my brain, so I&apos;ve not been sure how I&apos;d respond to the opportunity to take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecstasy.org&quot;&gt;ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;. (Oh yeah, other than it being illegal and me not doing illegal things. Just hypothetically if it wasn&apos;t illegal&amp;hellip;)

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/mdma/&quot;&gt;Methylenedioxymethamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; (MDMA) simulates the release of, among other things, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seratonin&quot;&gt;seratonin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HTP&quot;&gt;5-hydroxytryptamine&lt;/a&gt; (5-ht)) in the brain. Seratonin is not normally released in really high levels and so there is not a huge supply of it on hand. This is why you can only take ecstasy once a week or so. If you take it more frequently, it will stimulate the release of seratonin, but the chemical simply isn&apos;t present in your brain to be released. Continually lowered seratonin levels is also one theory as to why regular use can contribute to depression.

Seratonin is taken back into the brain cells that released, but once inside the majority of it is broken down by the enzyme &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase&quot;&gt;monoamine oxidase&lt;/a&gt; (MAO). Your body then has to synthesize more over time. This is done using two enzymes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HTP&quot;&gt;5-Hydroxy-Tryptophan&lt;/a&gt; (5-htp) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decarboxylation&quot;&gt;decarboxylese&lt;/a&gt;. I recognized the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan&quot;&gt;tryptophan&lt;/a&gt; from the now out of favor &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.howstuffworks.com/question519.htm&quot;&gt;theory on Thanksgiving turkey&lt;/a&gt;.

The last bit covered the actual possible causes for damage to the brain. One is that in the presence of significantly lowered seratonin levels, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine&quot;&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt; (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,2-diol (DA)) enters the cell and is toxic. It is also broken down by MAO and the resultant hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can cause oxidation of the cell. Also, repeated overstimulation of the seratonin receptors can cause &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation&quot;&gt;downregulation&lt;/a&gt; and thus a decreased sensitivity.

It is a fascinating piece of meat we carry around in our heads&amp;hellip;</event>

				<body>Nice job on the slideshow, the geek in me highly approves. But slideshow.js and Slideshow.js... come on now :P

I think there&apos;s a small bug in the slider, if the screen scrolls down at all the slider is off. You probably just need to offset by how much the page has scrolled vertically to fix it. I figure sometimes a quick fix of something minor can be satisfying when wrastlin&apos; with nastier problems. Good luck working on cross-browser compatibility :/</body>

				<body>&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I&apos;d forgotten about that. It was an artifact of how the program developed. It started out all in one file (slideshow) and then as it got big:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;will@trogdor:~/sites/pcvs.org/mr/miriam/bismillah$ wc *.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 50%; border-collapse: collapse&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;275&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;803&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;compatability.js&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;177&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;467&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5537&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;control.js&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;371&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1337&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13122&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Slideshow.js&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;322&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1059&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11278&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;UIInterface.js&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1145&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3666&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;36946&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;total&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broke it up into objects and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/miriam/bismillah/bismillah.sml&quot;&gt;config file&lt;/a&gt; and the timing and events are a &lt;code&gt;Slideshow&lt;/code&gt;, thence the name. I ought to go back and rename that original file&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to fix that slider too. The actual UI is what I&apos;ve spent the least amount of time on. If you look at the config you&apos;ll see there are 90 something odd millisecond markers for that song for the transitions between pictures. It took me about half an hour with &lt;a href=&quot;http://audacity.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; to get those worked out. I&apos;ve now listened to Let&apos;s Get Retarded about 700 times.&lt;/p&gt;

It could be worse. If we had the pop music stylings of 9-10 years ago, you could be setting this to the Spice Girls&apos; Wannabe or the Macarena.</body>

			<subject>Chemchoune El Arab</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been a bit remiss in getting updates written. This means that memorable events such as the tcheub-u-jen eating contest and my subsequent failed attempt at bulemia will be left to no better record than my abysmal memory. Oh well, so it goes&amp;hellip; &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemchoune El Arab, l&apos;un des grandes, one of the greats. Chemchoune is the Arabic form of Samson, and the man is fixture in the mythos of Mauritania. I&apos;d heard tales of his feats of strength from past volunteers, but had given up hope of actually seeing him perform. Much to my pleasure did I notice a poster featuring a big man with a handlebar mustache performing feats of strength and fortitude. In one corner he was buried under a pile of rocks, another showed him pulling a car with his teeth and a third with him swarmed with children. My pulse quickened, as this looked like the Chemchoune of lore, but the poster was in Arabic, so I couldn&apos;t be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short time later though, I saw the same poster, but this time in French. It was Chemchoune and he was going to be performing at one of the local basketball courts on Saturday! So, 16h Saturday saw myself and a group of interested volunteers at the Stade Sebkah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;The Amazing Exploits of Chemchoune El Arab&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing up on time was our first mistake. Somehow in my two years I&apos;ve managed to avoid learning properly that nothing ever happens on time here. We arrived to find a bunch of kids playing basketball and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattel.mr&quot;&gt;Mattel&lt;/a&gt; bus. Not terribly promising. We were wondering if we had the right place when someone noticed a stocky fellow with a voluminous beard and a plaid shirt standing near the bus. &quot;Is that him?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m not sure. It looks kinda like the picture.&quot; &quot;Maybe&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon closer inspection, it did in fact seem to be Chem. There was a big pile of concrete in the middle of the court that didn&apos;t look especially conducive to basketball playing, but which could possibly be useful in a feat of strength. We had a bit of time before we were to find out though. After half an hour or so a truck pulled up with some poles with banners on them. It was followed shortly by another Mattel bus. There were four poles and they went up at about the rate of one every twenty minutes, so round about 18h we were finally ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was sponsored by Mattel and for whatever reason they seemed to be aiming at the 8-14 year-old demographic. It was us five white folks, a few fellows in boubous doing logistics and about 500 kids. They&apos;d roped off the court and the borders were patrolled by police armed with lengths of electrical cord that they&apos;d brandish at the children every so often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An announcer came out and started working the crowd a bit. I have no idea what was said since it was  in Hassaniya and on a nearly defunct sound system. The kids seemed to get into it though. They started calling kids in from the audience and lined them up and gave them rice sacks. This whole event is taking place on a basketball court made of Mauritanian concrete. In the States you mix cement with sand and gravel to make concrete. We&apos;ve got the sand in spades, but the gravel is a bit scarce. In it&apos;s place we use seashells. This is fine and good except the cement is cheap and wears away leaving jagged bits of seashell sticking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the surface that one would ideally choose for a sack race, particularly when there&apos;s sand all around, but we volunteers seemed to be the only ones to see this. In any case, after a couple false starts the kids were off. There was a line of chairs at the far end of the court which they were supposed to go sit in. That didn&apos;t happen so much. Rather than sitting in the chairs the kids hurled themselves at them and there ended up a huge pile of kids and chairs from which one was extracted and declared the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They gave the kid a prize and started chanting, &quot;Chemchoune, Chemchoune, Mattel, Mattel, Chemchoune, Chemchoune&amp;hellip;&quot; At our beckoning, Chem appeared, decked out in full strong man&apos;s regalia. For those unacquainted, a strong man&apos;s regalia is bright blue ski bibs, white leather ski boots with hot pink detailing, a weight-lifter&apos;s belt painted teal and worn backwards, and a baby blue bedspread with big gold stars painted on it and worn as a cape. His belt had a little Mauritanian flag next to a little Syrian flag giving respect both to his country of birth and his adopted home. Corporate whore that he has become, Chem was also wearing a Mattel t-shirt. It detracted a bit from the overall splendor, but it was still quite a sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/chemchoune/chem_waving?full=1&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening was to be divided into three sets of competitions of Chem versus various fixtures of Mauritanian life. We began with Chem versus concrete. First, he lay down on his back with a rug on his stomach and had men crush concrete with a sledgehammer while he lay there. Next, he did the same thing except standing with the concrete laid across his back. Then they brought out a bed of nails and laid it on the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/chemchoune/tummy_breaking?full=1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 100%;&quot; src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/albums/chemchoune/tummy_breaking.sized.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chemchoune versus concrete&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We oohed and ahhed in appreciative wonder as Chem stripped off his shirt and bounced his pecs for us. We felt a little disquieted when he thrust his hips toward us, but accepted it as part of his ardor for performing. When it came to actually lying down on the nails, mighty Chem&apos;s resolved seemed to flag. He started to lie down and yanked back in pain. Again he tried and it was simply too hard. He went off and got the rug used to protect his stomach earlier. He laid it on the nails and then lay down on top of it. The announcer came out and challenged Chem as being weak. Chem looked to us to cut him a break, but we were having none of it. To the sound of 500 screaming kids he finally gave up and lay down barebacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They took the rug and lay it across Chem&apos;s chest and proceeded to break more concrete on him. He grunted a bit, but generally took the pain with a solace befitting his strong man status. After they were done with it he got up and jogged around the court so we could see the deep impressions the nails left in his back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the end of round one. There was an intermission with an absurd amount of talking about Mattel. Since the only work I understood was &quot;Mattel&quot; and the occasional number, I can&apos;t really report on how they managed to talk so much to a bunch of ten year-olds about phone service. There was also a game, the point of which was either to pop or not to pop a balloon. I never really understood that either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next round was Chemchoune versus rebar. They brought out ten foot long pieces of rebar and Chem&apos;s assistant braced one end while Chem drove himself against the other end till it bent in half. To step things up a notch Chem put a little piece of wood against his throat, braced the rebar there and again bent it in half. &quot;Bending rebar is an impressive feat. Where does one move from there?&quot; I was thinking to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/chemchoune/tummy_bending?full=1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 100%;&quot; src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/albums/chemchoune/tummy_bending.sized.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chemchoune bending rebar&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chem takes out a thickly folded cloth, covers his eye with it and proceeds to bend rebar with his eye socket. I only saw flashes of this as I was off convulsing at the graphic image of that rebar punching through his eye socket and into his skull. Bend it he did though and the crowd was appropriately awed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/chemchoune/eye_bending?full=1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 100%;&quot; src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/albums/chemchoune/eye_bending.sized.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chemchoune bending rebar with his eye&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another intermission then which I didn&apos;t pay much attention to. I was distracted by a random kid who came up and started tell me how he was going to grow up to be rich. His eventual goal was to be a patrone (big shot) and drink Fanta every day. We discussed at length whether I should give him the milk I was drinking. He had several excellent points, but I was just not convinced. In the end, he accidentally knocked it out of my hand and I gave the remainder to his friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chem&apos;s final adversary? A car. We moved from the court over to the sand and a waiting car. We started out with the car running over Chem&apos;s toes. It wasn&apos;t terribly impressive and the crowed wasn&apos;t wowed. Next though he lay down on the ground and the car drove over his arm with both tires. That was a bit more impressive and it left me wondering where they&apos;d go from here. The previous fights were in escalating groups of three. I wondered what exactly they were going to run over next, his stomach? his head?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one deviated from the others. Chem came up behind the car and grabbed the back bumper. The driver started backing the car over Chem. With a mighty heave, Chem lifted the back of the car until the tires were off the ground. The driver then floors it sending sand flying everywhere and volumes of smoke billowing from the exhaust. The crowd went wild cheering Chem&apos;s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/chemchoune/chem_v_car?full=1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 100%;&quot; src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/albums/chemchoune/chem_v_car.sized.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chemchoune defeating a car&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the extent of Chem&apos;s feats. A very impressive set all told. I&apos;ve asked people about him and it seems most everyone has heard of Chemchoune. Many express incredulity that he can do some of the things he has been rumored to do, but the overall tone is one of respect. I, myself, certainly enjoyed the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

			<subject>Faissant de la Contrebande</subject>
			<event>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Last weekend saw me off on a trip to the South. Mauritania is generally booze free except for a few restaurants and bars catering to expatriates. Since we are all pretty poor, we have to be a bit industrious to get our swerve on properly. This most frequently means picking up a bottle or two of cheap Senegalese booze when coming back from trips. It is not especially legal, but border searches are rare and it&apos;s really the only option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Sometimes though, when one wants to do a larger event, special steps are needed to provide a sufficient quantity. This was my mission for last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Rosso : Fast&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I hung around on Saturday to watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/35954.html&quot;&gt;Chemchoune&lt;/a&gt; and didn&apos;t get out of town until late on Sunday night. I was worried that it would be hard to catch a taxi late in the day. This proved to be no problem at all and within ten minutes of arriving at the garage I was on my way to Rosso. We were not ten minutes into the drive when the guys sitting next to me started bickering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Keep in mind that I am in a Mauritanian taxi brusse. This means there was two people in the front passenger seat and four in the back. Or there would normally have been four in the back. We picked up an eight year-old girl on the way out of town, so we were five in the back seat in total. These two fellows who are arguing are literally sitting on top of each other with their faces not five inches apart as their voices begin to rise. The fun began as the guy next to the window pulled out his pipe and began to light up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;What are you doing? You can&apos;t smoke in here; there&apos;s not enough room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Or course I can. I want to smoke. Where do you think you are? Europe? Are you a Frenchman?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to respect other people. You can&apos;t smoke.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;You&apos;re a snob. If you want to be like that you should have rented a whole car for yourself like a big shot.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;You should be respectful of others.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify; font-style: italic&quot;&gt;[The conversation switches to Hassaniya: a language much better suited to bickering than French. After a bit, it drifts back&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&apos;t know me. How can you tell me that I can&apos;t smoke?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&apos;t know me either, but we are going to be in this taxi for a long time. We will get to know each other.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sure. We&apos;ll talk for a bit, then you&apos;ll tell me: &apos;I&apos;m a son of a donkey. I was born in a family of donkeys. I&apos;m a donkey myself.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;That&apos;s a pretty shitty thing to say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Son of a donkey.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&quot;Shithead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;There was a Wolof girl about my age sitting to my right. We were both cracking up during this whole exchange. I&apos;m not really sure why they decided to conduct it in French, but I&apos;m certainly glad that they did. About the time that I thought they were about ready to start slapping each other, we pulled to to a police checkpoint and they quieted down. After we pulled back out, the smoker solaced himself with muttering in Hassaniya to the driver. He never did light up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The rest of the ride was significantly less entertaining. The driver tried to add to the thrill a bit by waiting till the moon rose before turning on his single dim headlight. He used the accepted practice of turning on his driver side blinker as we passed people so that they wouldn&apos;t hit us. After a bit though, even the threat of impending collision wasn&apos;t enough to keep us alert. The little girl passed out in my lap and the girl fell asleep on my shoulder. For having three people occupying a single seat, we managed to be surprisingly comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I got in to the Rosso house round about 23h, got suggestions on types of pants to wear from Ayrin and Theresa, and bright and early the next morning hit the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid ; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Rosso, Senegal&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;1:00&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;100um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Rosso, Senegal : Stink&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;My crossing on the Mauritanian side was amazing. I walked through the gate, they stamped my passport and just as I walked down the the ferry, it pulled out. The trick is to get there right before 9:00. There aren&apos;t many foreigners around to get their papers done and the ferry crosses for the first time right at 9 when the border opens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;My crossing in Senegal was also amazing. The police decided to wait until the entire boat was unloaded before any of them came up to the commissariat. This meant everyone had to stand at the window for 45 minutes. To make things more interesting, a semi backed up till there was about three feet of free space in front of the window. The rapidly rising sun made sure that I was well scented with the body odors of my many not terribly well washed companions. After a while I saw a guy who had been handling my passport wander out of the station, then out of the port. Slightly worried about my passport I followed him into a boutique where, when confronted, said, &quot;Oh yeah, I&apos;ve still got your passport in my pocket. Sorry about that. You can go on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Richard Toll : Booze!&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;My hookup point was Richard Toll. The liquor store is just down from the garage. My goal for the trip was five liters each of rum, vodka and gin. Of these the store had copious quantities of gin and a single bottle of vodka. The woman working the store sent me off to another store near the municipal stadium in the off chance that their stock would differ. The stadium was about three kilometers away and the stock did not differ. The only difference was no vodka and a single bottle of rum which I bought before going back to the first place. In the end my purchase was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid; width: 75%; margin: auto; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; text-align: center&quot;&gt;whiskey&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I bought a five liter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kirene.sn&quot;&gt;bottle of water&lt;/a&gt; (800cfa), dumped the water out and filled it with gin. All the rest of it I was carrying in the bottles, and it was quite hefty. I&apos;d guess somewhere around 30kg. I&apos;d spent several hours wandering around town and so it was afternoon by the time I finally got off to my next stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;350cfa + 150cfa&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Dogana : Cheese!&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;On my way to Dogana, I texted a volunteer I know who lives there. She happened to be in town and so we decided to catch up. A microfinance organization she works with was having an event that day. I showed up to a huge group people standing around and giving speeches and sometimes playing drums and dancing. It was really fascinating to watch and very heartening to see people so excited about their economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I hung out for a bit and we traded stories while continually shooing kids away from my five liter bidon with explanations of, &quot;that water is no good for you.&quot; After about an hour we went back to her families house and she had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pfgoldfish.com&quot;&gt;goldfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kraft.com/100/innovations/kraftmac.html&quot;&gt;mac and cheese&lt;/a&gt;! It was all I remembered it as being. So good&amp;hellip; We sat and chatted for a couple more hours. She professed complete lack of any appreciable skills, but her having run a marathon and understanding international economics proved her less than honest in her assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We actually sat around talking until after the border had closed at 18h, but fortunately the fellow sitting on the river bank writing passport numbers in a stenographer&apos;s pad was pretty relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/06/14&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Jidrel Mohguen&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;0:15&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;150cfa&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Jidrel Mohguen : Bees!&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The trip back to Mauritania was quick and painless other than my fear that I&apos;d tip the canoe with my 65 some odd pounds of booze. The gendarme on the other side was easy enough to deal with. After he&apos;d written my name phonetically in Arabic in his little book, he sent me on my way. Unfortunately, the house I was headed to was a little bit of a hike from the border. Only a couple kilometers, but with my bag, it was a trek. I was about halfway there sitting on the side of the road when a French couple pulled up in a pickup and offered me a ride. Turns out that they work for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dole.com&quot;&gt;Dole&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a banana plantation just outside of town. Who&apos;d a thunk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After wandering around for a bit, I finally find the volunteer I&apos;m looking for, and she looks to be carrying snow suits. This is a bit odd since the ski season isn&apos;t for another couple months. It turns out that she has been doing a bee keeping project, and she is carrying protective suits of her own design. I was suitably impressed and even more so when she tells me they are heading off to the hives to try to find the queen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I am not really scared of many things. Small things that sting are pretty high up on the list. When Steph and I were dating, one of the few times I was ever really seriously pissed at her is when there was a wasp in the car and she wouldn&apos;t stop and let me out. So, when, about twenty minutes later, there were several hundred pissed off African honey bees swarming my head, I was slightly disquieted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;What made it especially interesting was a comment mentioned in passing as we approached the hive: &quot;Try not to let the netting touch your skin because they&apos;ll sting you through the netting where it does.&quot; If you&apos;ve ever had so many bees crawling on your face that you can&apos;t see through them, the possibility that you are less than completely safe is disconcerting. I did it though. I wasn&apos;t terribly useful as most of my time was spent standing still working at not running screaming into the river, but I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The volunteer I was with had a little hole in one of her sleeves. She got stung eight or nine times and was far calmer than I was. Of the Mauritanians with us, one chickened out entirely before we arrived and the other was about as useful as I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The bees stayed with us nearly all the way back to the village despite our continual brushing ourselves off. Apparently if you do this with American bees you don&apos;t even need the suit for the first part of opening the hive. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insecta-inspecta.com/bees/killer/&quot;&gt;African bees&lt;/a&gt; are more aggressive though and these were apparently in a particularly bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We finally lost them all on the walk back. The evening then ended with some dinner, conversation and well needed sleep. The next morning I met a lot of the family that I missed the night before. We walked around and visited a bit, but by 9h I was in a van headed to Rosso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/06/15&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Jidrel Mohguen&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Rosso&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;1:15&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;500um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Rosso : Dirty Boy&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Along the river there are areas which have dirt instead of the sand and rock that cover most of this country. In between Jidrel Mohguen and Rosso is one of those areas. I emerged from the van, where I&apos;d been riding on sacks of charcoal, a uniform light brown in color. Once I made it to the garage, people didn&apos;t even want to ride next to me I was so dirty. I managed to get in a 4x4 though, and was on my way after repeated warnings of, &quot;my souvenirs are in there; they&apos;re fragile. Be careful,&quot; to the fellow manhandling my bag into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/06/15&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Rosso&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Nouakchott&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;3:00&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;1500um + 200um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Garage Rosso&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Chez Moi&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;0:20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;500um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We were stopped quite a bit coming into town. It was mostly to harass the Senegalese people in the car though. The police always wanted to see my id, but they never gave me any problems. I got back to my house and was taking a shower by 13h. A fun little weekend adventure breaking international law; always entertaining. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I know some really interesting people here&amp;hellip; The game de la semaine is based off the song &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~wwu/sounds/mp3s/dre_deezNuts_lyrics.txt&quot;&gt;Deez Nuts&lt;/a&gt;&quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003AEQ/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;The Chronic&lt;/a&gt;. The intro to the song goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0em; padding: 0em&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Thug:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Naw, what you gonna do today?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0em; padding: 0em&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Woman:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Um, pick up my clothes from the cleaners. I&apos;m gonna get my nails done&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0em; padding: 0em&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Thug:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Hey, did what&apos;s his name get at you yesterday?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic; margin: 0em; padding: 0em&quot;&gt;[phone click]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to get people to say, &quot;who?&quot; when they are on the lookout for it is a real challenge. On our way up to Terjit this last weekend we had a couple Hassaniya speakers with us. At one stop a guy went into a boutique and start talking about a friend of his in Nouakchott who had a friend in this village. When the boutiquiére inquired, &quot;minwho?&quot;, the requisite &quot;Deez Nuts&quot; reply left us all rolling. It was a bit obnoxious, but good natured enough to not be seriously mean.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Balance</subject>
			<event>I&apos;ve slept twenty hours in the last three days, but none in the last twenty four hours since I&apos;ve been sitting in my lab for that long piddling around. Does erratic alternation between extremes count as a type of balance? Sort of like a seesaw with two big ass rocks at either end?

Internet Explorer sucks, btw. You can&apos;t &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/tests/test_ie_dom_versions.html&quot;&gt;pull nodes&lt;/a&gt; out of a DOM tree loaded via &lt;code&gt;XMLHTTP&lt;/code&gt; and insert them into the main document. This means that if you want to pull in chunks of other HTML files you are shit out of luck. Also, &lt;code&gt;getDocumentById&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/tests/test_ajax_element_by_id.html&quot;&gt;is not defined&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code&gt;XMLHTTP&lt;/code&gt; objects. I ended up writing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/javascript_compatability/compatability.js&quot;&gt;wrapper&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath&quot;&gt;XPath&lt;/a&gt; functions to get the nodes I needed. Not that it turned out to matter since I couldn&apos;t use the nodes anyhow.

It has been a struggle and it is far from over. The basic animation components are starting to work, but all the dynamic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/&quot;&gt;stylesheets&lt;/a&gt; are munged. It is a real pain. I was hoping to have something to send to the invitees before they came, but that is looking iffy since I have actual work to do.

Anyhow, off to sleep for a couple hours before coming in to teach tonight. I did a conference call yesterday with me in Mauritania, a guy in South Africa, someone in New York and someone else in Texas. It was convoluted to say the least. We&apos;ve got some money missing from the last course and quite a bit of equipment from when the Academy started. We&apos;re getting along though. I&apos;ve been feeling better teaching this time. An hour spent looking up the terms I&apos;m going to need in French does wonders.

Off to bed&amp;hellip;</event>

			<subject>Personality</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I think I&apos;ve blown a fuse in my brain. Something about 22 hours staring at a computer screen trying to master the evil empire while eating animal crackers was a bit too much. (I ate five 150g bags of animal crackers sitting here. That&apos;s over a pound and a half of little fishes and camels. (Mauritanian animal crackers have no bears or lions.))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been sitting here wandering over good time wasting sites. I went back to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/26753.html&quot;&gt;okcupid account&lt;/a&gt;. There is a base personality test that they use for broad categorization and I decided to retake that since my last assessment was &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/personality?type=RGLD&amp;g=1&amp;o=1&quot;&gt;Boy Next Door&lt;/a&gt;&quot; which I felt was generally fitting, but not completely apt. I wanted to see if things would come out different if I took it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test assesses along four axes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: thin dashed; width: 100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;float: left; width: 48%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h2 style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;float: left; width: 44%; text-align: center; border: solid; padding: .1em;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3 style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://is0.okcupid.com/graphics/persons/random.gif&quot;&gt;Random&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Rash, Bold, Unpredictable. Makes decisions faster and less carefully than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;float: right; width: 44%; text-align: center; border: solid; padding: .1em;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3 style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://is0.okcupid.com/graphics/persons/deliberate.gif&quot;&gt;Deliberate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Makes decisions carefully. Is aware of, and weighs, consequences. Takes time to think things through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div style=&quot;float: right; width: 48%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h2 style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Care&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;float: left; width: 44%; text-align: center; border: solid; padding: .1em;&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the layout of the test and the various axes. So far as overall personality, I think something like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enneagraminstitute.com&quot;&gt;enneagram&lt;/a&gt; is a more complete metric. For something that is more easily grasped though and specifically aimed at dating, I like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I went from being the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/personality?type=RGLD&amp;g=1&amp;o=1&quot;&gt;Boy Next Door&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;acronym title=&quot;Random Gentle Lover Dreamer&quot;&gt;RGLD&lt;/acronym&gt;) to being that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/personality?type=RBSD&amp;g=1&amp;o=1&quot;&gt;Last Man on Earth&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;acronym title=&quot;Random Brutal Sex Dreamer&quot;&gt;RBSD&lt;/acronym&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I like this one less in description, but I can definitely feel the shift away from love and emotionality in myself as of late. It has just been too long. I&apos;m tired of being lonely and sad. I figure I ought to just get in the game and try and hook up a bit. The rest will just have to wait for that incogitable time when I meet a good woman. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of my innocence is depressing to contemplate. I&apos;m gonna go drink and play pool&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have fun updating my adjectives. It pandered to my enjoyment of things hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian. I went from perspicacious, loquacious and irreverent to mercurial, ebullient and blithe.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Livres Déprimant</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I was lying in bed reading Margaret Atwood&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385491069/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;The Edible Woman&lt;/a&gt; this morning when I recognized a trend in the books I&apos;ve been reading as of late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One theme is the ephemeral and futile nature of love. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385335946/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;On the Nature of Human Romantic Interaction&lt;/a&gt;
by Karl Iagnemma is a good case in point. All of the stories are very well told, but there isn&apos;t really a happy ending to any of them. The final story, &lt;i&gt;Children of Hunger&lt;/i&gt;, is a wonderfully crafted and completely depressing look at the balance between fulfilling one&apos;s internal emotional life and pursing the external, in this case scientific progress.

&lt;p&gt;Joseph Heller&apos;s protagonist in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684841215/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;Something Happened&lt;/a&gt; has one of the most jaded (and honest) perspectives on human relationships I&apos;ve encountered in a while. It was especially fascinating for me in that his descent into disillusionment began as he entered his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0173.html#grimm&quot;&gt;donkey years&lt;/a&gt;. Since I&apos;ll soon leave the desert and rejoin the real world of deadlines, fast food and picket fences, this was especially poignant (and disheartening) for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another theme is people who go crazy in response to the the pressures of life. Pretty much every character in Paul Auster&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140115854/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;Moon Palace&lt;/a&gt; has a breakdown at one point or another. Auster makes it sound almost romantic. The book is not a little ball of sunbeams by any means, but it left me in a significantly better mood than &lt;a href=&quot;0140097058&quot;&gt;In the Country of Last Things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is strange is that the books aren&apos;t my selections for the most part. All but one of them were given to me by someone else when I asked for good books they&apos;d read. I&apos;m taking it as a sign from God that people suck and I&apos;m supposed to just give up and go crazy. &amp;#x263A; Unfortunately I&apos;m a bit too busy right now to go crazy, but soon. I&apos;ve got it penciled in for mid-July. I figure I&apos;ll start on the degenerating descent sometime at the beginning of the month. I&apos;m already pretty antisocial as of late. I figure adding in some eclectic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cultofbob.co.uk/hamster/&quot;&gt;dietary practices&lt;/a&gt; and muttering to myself, and I can get to a breakdown in three weeks or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In seriousness though, if you run across any of these, give them a read. I&apos;ve been pleased with all of them. Something Happened in particular messed with my head and Moon Palace made me cry in a detached fitful sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Google Rox My Sox</subject>
			<event>I was trying to help a friend with a mail problem and I noted in Google&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gmail.google.com/support/&quot; title=&quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; that in addition to providing &lt;a href=&quot;pop3://pop.gmail.com&quot;&gt;POP&lt;/a&gt; access, they also permit &lt;a href=&quot;smtp://smtp.gmail.com&quot;&gt;SMTP&lt;/a&gt; forwarding. Sweet!

This means that I can send mail using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/&quot;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.google.com&quot;&gt;gmail&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s interface just fine, but for popping off a quick reply, doing HTML messages or writing in French, Thunderbird had its advantages.

I&apos;ve not been able to use it because though &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&quot;&gt;STARTTLS&lt;/a&gt; is enabled on both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://honors.tntech.edu&quot;&gt;honors&apos; server&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stderr.org&quot;&gt;stderr&lt;/a&gt;, they won&apos;t let me connect because none of the addresses in this country have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup&quot;&gt;PTR record&lt;/a&gt;. I also can&apos;t run my own server here because our entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afrinic.net/cgi-bin/whois?searchtext=82.151.64.0&quot;&gt;IP block&lt;/a&gt; has (rightfully) made it into a couple &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL&quot;&gt;blackhole lists&lt;/a&gt;. So, I&apos;ve been limited to web interfaces for the most part.

The neat thing is that gmail takes all the messages I send through it and threads them with existing threads if appropriate. The timing can get a little off, but all in all I end up with a single coherent thread regardless of if I replied using gmail&apos;s interface or Thunderbird. That attention to detail is what I like about the Google folks.</event>

			<subject>Things Fall Apart</subject>
			<event>Well, I think they&apos;ve finally stolen the last of my cable. When I got here two years ago we had a 100m roll of cat5 along with a couple hundred RJ-45 jacks and a patch panel. Little by little the people from the university have been coming by and taking different things. I was just hunting for the last 20m or so of cable that I had in the closet and it is gone now.

I&apos;m really ready to just give up. There are so many other interesting projects to work on and trying to get anything done here is a slow losing battle against futility.

I had two people who wanted to enroll in the new semester two class that we started two weeks ago. When they took the first semester one though, it was in version 2 of the curriculum. The way the Academy system is set up this means they can&apos;t enroll in my version 3 semester two class. Normally you create a &quot;bridge&quot; course to get them up to date on the new version. Our status in the system is messed up though because our position as a regional academy was revoked a couple months ago.

They pushed to become a regional academy because growth and new projects make it easier to find funding. Being a regional academy means taking on responsibility for managing local academies in the area and we are hardly managing ourselves.

So, eventually the status was revoked, as it should have been. The records in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cisco.netacad.net&quot;&gt;online system&lt;/a&gt; got mucked up though and we couldn&apos;t create the bridge classes. So, it took about a week of dealing with Cisco in order to get all that sorted out. Once I do though, I find I still can&apos;t enroll these students. Upon examining their records I find that neither one of them actually passed the first semester class that they took. One of them had 100% on the final exam. I am good with computers and having just taught the course, when I took the final exam to make sure I&apos;d covered everything, I got 92%. There&apos;s really no way to get 100% on the final exam other than to cheat.

But I wasn&apos;t going to argue that point with them. Instead I told them that they couldn&apos;t take the second semester until they passed the first. They told me that they wanted to take it and asked if there was anything they could do. I agreed to create a new semester one class that they could take quickly and get caught up.

This process managed to destroy my existing class because I kept trying to hold back giving the exams (which are theoretically given on a weekly basis) because I wanted for these students to be able to take the exams. As I held back I ran out of stuff to do since we&apos;d done all the exercises already. When there was nothing to do the other students stopped coming.

This has happened before. It is a real problem. The students stop coming if there isn&apos;t anything going on. Then if you try and start back up people start to show up slowly, but when they come in they want to have everything they&apos;ve missed covered again. So it is a jerky process as I try to keep the students who are coming entertained enough to keep coming and the others up to speed enough that they keep coming as well.

So I was here 12h-20h every day this weekend. I am trying to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/nouakchott_notes/&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt; done, but it was also so that these guys could get caught up. They never showed up. One skill I&apos;ve not really honed here is being a hard ass. It looks like I&apos;m going to get to practice soon.</event>

				<body>The hard part about teaching is balancing the need to &quot;Fail &apos;em all and let God sort &apos;em out&quot; with compassion. Some students screw up, and simple patience and understanding will fix the problems.

Then, there are the others. For instance, this previous semester, I failed a student, he never attended class, he never responded to my emails, or turned anything in. The best part was that he wanted an incomplete. He even appealed getting an &apos;F&apos; all the way up to the dean. Of course, since I had tried on multiple occassions to get in touch with him, and done other things &quot;above and beyond&quot; the call of duty, it was an open and shut case.

Of course, I realize that class attendence and other things probably are subject to a lot of different cultural biases over there.

I dunno, I made a lot of mistakes both semesters I taught. Unfortunately, everyone is more interested in political butt covering here, and so all advice I asked for dealt with that. The books suck, and students were undermotivated. I tried to do the best I could, but I&apos;m really not sure what to do the next time I teach. I tried motivational speeches, but I don&apos;t think those mattered. My lectures weren&apos;t that great, and no one was interested in working.

Ultimately, that last one is the killer though. Few of my students really wanted to learn the material, and most of them had serious remedial problems whether they wanted to or not. What&apos;s disturbing for us, is that I was teaching precalculus and algebra stuff to Freshmen.

What makes things worse with most of my students, was that when I was a hard-ass morale dropped to nothing, and no one showed up or did anything at all. I don&apos;t know what to tell you. Good luck with it.</body>

			<subject>Drinkin&apos;</subject>
			<event>I was going to put this to a longer treatise, but I&apos;m too busy and want to get it down.

Weekend before last, a bunch of us headed off the the desert oasis of Terjit to bid farewell to our education volunteers with some relaxing, dancing and boozing. I enjoyed myself generally, but I did not have a very successful drinking experience. I suppose that had my goal been catalepsy I was right on target.

I ended up in a heap over by the pool and my participation in the large scale nudity I hear took place later was only tangential in that I got my pictures taken with bare asses hovering over my slackened face. I wasn&apos;t in a really bad spot so far as danger to my health or anything like that. I just missed the majority of the party and I was really disappointed in myself.

It has left me examining a bit my relationship to alcohol and how I deal with it. Given that I&apos;d been drunk less that a dozen times before coming here, saying that I drink more now is not especially meaningful. I&apos;d say I get intoxicated three or four times a month. I don&apos;t drink very often when I&apos;m not shooting to get at least a little drunk because I still don&apos;t especially enjoy the taste of alcohol.

I&apos;ve been sick and passed out four times in the last two years. All of those times were bigger parties. I have a bad habit of drinking anything that&apos;s handed to me. It&apos;s not a problem when I&apos;m with a small group and everyone&apos;s drinking about the same speed. When there are enough people that I can drift between different groups and do lots of different rounds of shots, I start to get in trouble. That&apos;s a trend I&apos;d not realized before Terjit and something I&apos;m gonna keep an eye on in the future.

At one point I looked down upon alcohol as a crutch. All it does is lower inhibitions and why can&apos;t I simply liberate myself? I&apos;d say honestly that I still agree with most that basic premise. I&apos;m not sure if I was completely confident if I&apos;d want to drink or not. It is completely theoretical at this point since I&apos;m not that guy and I&apos;ve got to deal with the reality of being me. Does this make me less of a worthwhile person? Maybe.

To break the fourth wall, I was just wondering if any of you had anything insightful comments on drinking. Is it something that emotionally and spiritually mature people do?</event>

				<body>being not much of either, i can&apos;t really help with that last question... but as far as lowering inhibitions without over-imbibing goes, i find that the idea that everyone &lt;i&gt;thinks&lt;/i&gt; i&apos;m drinking helps a lot... lately when clubbing, most of the time i&apos;ll grab one beer, just because i like it... then switch over to diet coke.  and smile at everyone as if it were rum and coke.  instant freedom to dance like an idiot and drive home at the end of the night.

(started doing this once i realized that i wasn&apos;t really sure what my pals at the club were drinking.  and ok, so it doesn&apos;t lower the inhibitions all the way, but i find that heavy alcohol tends to set mine a bit lower than i like in groups of mostly strangers...  and i get horrid hangovers.  last weekend, i had three fairly strong drinks and ended up with a headache well into the next evening.)</body>

Use or abuse of alcohol has no correlation with how worthwhile a person is.

&lt;i&gt;To break the fourth wall, I was just wondering if any of you had anything insightful comments on drinking. Is it something that emotionally and spiritually mature people do?&lt;/i&gt;

I don&apos;t think &quot;emotionally and spiritually mature&quot; people abuse alcohol. I doubt many use it, except in extreme moderation. On the other hand, most of the best people I know drink on a regular basis.

Personally, I&apos;ve found the experiences of drinking to excess unfortunate but important parts of my development. Then again, with the way we&apos;ve had it defined for us, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been a particularly spiritually mature person.</body>

			<subject>Des Transformations</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m back in town having been in Kaédi to do a little training for this year&apos;s crop of new kids. They really are kids too. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/roster/trainees_2003.html&quot;&gt;My group&lt;/a&gt; came in with an average age of 26. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/roster/trainees_2004.html&quot;&gt;Last year&apos;s group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org/roster/trainees_2005.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; are both 23. Freakin&apos; kids. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been in a funky mood the last couple weeks. We&apos;ve got old people leaving and new people coming in and the fact that all this is drawing to a close is settling in. Going down to Stage was just odd. I&apos;ve not spent much time in Kaédi, so almost all of my memories are from being there as a stagiaiere. The juxtaposition really highlights both how much I&apos;ve changed and how much I&apos;ve not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bunch of stuff came together at once in the club about a week ago and my brain melted down. I just had to get out and walk for a bit. On the way home I waxed melodramatic for a bit and talked about how much I&apos;ve changed and how I like the changes, but I feel like I&apos;m faking at times. That I&apos;m significantly less cool than I pretend to be. It was nice to be like that for a bit. I&apos;ve not formed many friendships here where I felt comfortable sounding seriously neurotic. To indulge a bit was relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s mostly girls which still throw me for a loop. I like them, am good at befriending them, but as for having moves to put on them; I&apos;m at a loss. I need game. So far, all I&apos;ve got is &quot;Hi, I&apos;m Billy. Wanna fuck?&quot; And I can&apos;t do that one without giggling when I can do it at all. I&apos;m not looking to become a complete slut, but every so often I meet a cute girl and being something other than a gawking ball of introversion would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;tests&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve not yet given up all hope. Change is possible. I took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=8797531974480148663&quot;&gt;Three Variable Purity Test&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;lj user=&quot;hlb1995&quot;&gt;&apos;s journal, and it came out like this:&lt;/p&gt;

			<subject>Singin&apos; and Dancin&apos;</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re going to throw a beach bash in a couple weeks when everyone is getting ready to &lt;acronym title=&quot;Close [Of] Service&quot;&gt;COS&lt;/acronym&gt;. There&apos;s a good live band that has been performing at the bar and they&apos;ve said they&apos;re up for coming out and performing for us. My group has a couple guitar players and I&apos;m looking for acoustic guitar songs that are good for playing so everyone can sing and dance along. I got a CDs worth of suggestions at the party in Boghé a couple days ago, but does anyone have any others?&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>&lt;i&gt;sigh&lt;/i&gt; It must be really nice having one of those memory things. I&apos;m glad to hear though that I didn&apos;t simply suck. ☺

Btw, I was thinking of you the other day. I got some fabric for a panya (wrap skirt) for you. Assuming I can get my stuff home (which is iffy currently), I&apos;ll see you get it.</body>

				<body>That would be quite nice of you. I still get all kinds of compliments on that wrap skirt you got me at the WOW festival years ago.</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;yawn&lt;/i&gt; I&apos;m back again from traveling around a bit. I&apos;ll write about that in a bit, but for the moment I&apos;m too sleepy. None of my students showed up for class tonight. I don&apos;t feel terribly responsible for it since I&apos;ve been here and been teaching. It hasn&apos;t been enthralling, but it has been good enough. I&apos;m teaching router configuration in French for God&apos;s sake. There&apos;s only so much that can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I&apos;m entertaining myself with some piddling on the internet. The project de la soiree is defacement of my person. Pretty much all the girls here get hennaed at one point or another. (See &lt;lj user=&quot;madmaddy123&quot;&gt;&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/madmaddy123/2462.html&quot;&gt;description&lt;/a&gt;.) The hennaing of the hands and feet is a part of the wedding ceremony and it looks pretty cool. The only thing that guys ever do, and this is rare, is to put henna in their hair, usually the beard. I&apos;m thinking this would be a bad look for me and I can&apos;t grow facial hair anyhow, so I&apos;m looking for something a little different.

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve tried to buy henna stuff before, but the women who sell it only speak Hassaniya, so I never could get a good explanation of what exactly I needed. They also looked at me funny as to why I, a guy, wanted hanna anyhow. I happened to be in the market the other day with a female volunteer who spoke Hassaniya and she hooked me up. I got my henna and I also got some sort of fixative that I think is gum arabic. (The bottle is in Arabic, so I&apos;m not sure.)

&lt;p&gt;So now I am trying to figure out who I&apos;d like to tattoo on myself. I was thinking initially of doing an om in Sanskrit maybe on the shoulder:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.muktinath.org/hinduism/om-aum.htm&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/albums/tattoos/aum_om_cropped.png&quot; alt=&quot;om&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto; height: 100px&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m leaning now more toward something with a little more machismo: barbed wire around the bicep. I figure I can do it with a certain sense of whimsy and my friends probably won&apos;t make much more fun of me than they usually do. Well, they probably will, but I&apos;m used to it. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.funtoos.com/vi//49/17/34/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/albums/tattoos/barbed_wires_cropped.png&quot; alt=&quot;barbed wire&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining problem is one of application. There are two ways that one can get hennaed. The one you see the most often is drawing. Usually in the States someone will use a syringe without the needle to draw designs on the skin. Here they cut the corner off a plastic bag, but the idea is the same. The second method, the one that I am going to try, is to put tape down to block off the area you want to henna. Generally this is done to create blockier designs, but I&apos;m thinking if I get a razor and some surgical tape I could cut curves fairly easily. This will mean though that things would work best if the tape was all one piece. Little chunks of whitespace in the middle of the design will be hard to do. So, maybe I&apos;ll go with a tribal design like this:&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.funtoos.com/vi//49/42/34/&quot;&gt;

			<subject>Traveling Again</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I headed off to Saint Louis, Senegal for a friend&apos;s birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/06/13&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Université den Nouakchott&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Garage Rosso&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;0:20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;500um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Garage Rosso&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Rosso&lt;/td&gt;
                                                                                                                            
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2:30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;3000um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Leaving town&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Showing a normal lack of foresight, I showed up at the garage around noon. I was thinking that the border would be open at 3:00 and so after the two and a half hour drive I&apos;d get there about when it opened up. What I forgot is that the schedule for the garage is fairly Mediterranean. It is hot as hell in the middle of the day so everyone hides out in the shade somewhere from about 11:00 until after the late afternoon prayer. This was a bit of a problem since the border was going to close again at 6:00 and I didn&apos;t especially want to have to bribe someone or get arrested again.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Fortunately there were a couple Senegalese people at the garage who also were looking to cross and we all went down patrone style in a car with only four people. It was a little expensive, but the car was nice and I had enough room that I took myself a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/06/13&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Rosso, Mauritania&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Rosso, Senegal&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;0:20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;150um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Cards&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Before leaving Nouakchott I&apos;d equipped myself with both Sentel and Alizé sim cards. I didn&apos;t know for sure when my friends were headed to Saint Louis, so I was going to go to the border and send some text messages to find out the plan. Much to my disappointment, once I was in the network I found that neither card had any credit on it. Not only that, but the two Mauritanian networks (Mauritel and Mattel) were both out in Rosso. So, I went ahead and crossed the river and put credit on one of the cards only to find that they weren&apos;t coming til the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: thin solid; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;2005/06/13&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Rosso, Senegal&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;Rosso, Mauritania&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;0:10&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid;&quot;&gt;100um&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Nightfall&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I didn&apos;t really feel like wandering Saint Louis by myself, so I headed back across the river for the night. Here I ran into a small problem. My passport is pretty much full. I&apos;m trying to avoid having to go to the embassy to get more pages in the off chance that they inquire as to how I&apos;m crossed the river about fifteen times only having taken four vacations in the last two years. So, as I came back across I explained the situation and asked them not to do any more stamping. That was surprisingly easy.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I headed to the Rosso house to watch some DVDs, but found that the Mauritanian from which the player was borrowed had reclaimed it. So instead I did a little writing.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I&apos;ve recently finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055337849X/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;The Brothers K&lt;/a&gt; by David James Duncan. I really liked the writing and it has inspired me to write sometimes on my own. More so in homage rather than imitation since my own wordcraft is crippled by my inability to maintain focus on a subject for more than thirty seconds at a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After the rains, Rosso becomes a Venice gone disgustingly awry. One volunteer postulated a vile plot on the part of someone in the city planning department because, &quot;it just isn&apos;t possible to achieve a drainage system this inefficient by accident.&quot; After having abandoned my hopes of going to Saint Louis for the evening, I attempted to pass the night at a volunteer&apos;s house in town. My attempt was nearly thwarted by an enormous cesspool of a lake spanning the entire street.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Since many of the houses are dug out some below street level, people were having to sandbag their doorsteps to keep their houses from filling with water. I eventually circled the block and made my way into the house. After dumping my stuff I realized I&apos;d not eaten all day and went in search of sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Sensitive to the damper that the 90% humidity put on Rosso&apos;s normal charm, some industrious soul attempted to brighten the atmosphere by disemboweling a cassette tape and decorating both a tree and the cow tethered to it. The cow seemed largely nonplussed by the effort as evidenced by the consumption of what looked to be a goodly portion of the decoration along with its feed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The stand I usually get sandwiches from was surrounded entirely by water and closed. So, I wandered on and eventually found a house serving &quot;nyechna&quot; (or at least that&apos;s the best understanding I got before I grew embarrassed after asking to have it repeated four times). It was a sort of rice paste with bits of fish ground up in it. I wasn&apos;t sure on the fish from the taste, but having to dislodge a couple scales from between my teeth confirmed it.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The entire meal I avoided the ice water sitting on the table because I know the Rosso is one of very few sites in Mauritania where the volunteers don&apos;t drink the water. That and a recent cholera outbreak in the region. At the end of dinner I went and bought some tchakri from her. Tchakri is yogurt, couscous, nutmeg, raisins and crack cocaine. Well, I&apos;ve not actually seen them add the crack, but given how strongly I crave the stuff it&apos;s a pretty safe bet. As she was making it she called for the pitcher and dumped a bunch of the water I&apos;d been so scrupulously avoiding into the mix. This particular tchakri was made with kosum which is more like soured milk than yogurt. I needed my fix so bad though that I threw caution to the wind and ate it anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Then it was back to the house for some Margaret Atwood and sleep in preparation for more travels in the morrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Day number two of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/39583.html&quot;&gt;Saint Louis sabbatical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Do Over&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I headed out bright and early the next morning. The border opens at 8 and the ferry crosses for the first time at 9, so I figured I hit it right around 9 and get right across since my passport was stamped from the day before. Silly me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I get to the border and there is a guard at the gate. This is not unusual, but the 500um entrance fee he is asking for is. The Senegalese guy next to me just pays it, but I decided instead to tell him that I was in here yesterday and many times over the last two years and there is no such fee. He just grunts and stands there. I just stand in front of him and glare. After about five minutes he tells me that there isn&apos;t really a fee, but he&apos;s hungry and wants breakfast money. He asks me if I&apos;m ok with giving him some money for breakfast. I tell him that it isn&apos;t normal to pay to come in and I&apos;m not giving him anything since he already lied to me. We then resume our standing for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Eventually he just sort of moves out of the way and I push by him. He decides not to push the issue. Amazingly the ferry hasn&apos;t left yet. I&apos;m quite pleased and start heading toward it when a guy with one of the guards starts hissing at me. I know what he wants and it would have been the smart thing to just walk on and make them come after me. (Since there&apos;s about a 50% chance they wouldn&apos;t have bothered.) But I&apos;m dumb and so I went over to talk to them. It was the same guard I spent ten minutes discussing the fact I&apos;d be coming through this morning with the night before. I explained it one more time and he let me go. Just in time for me to see the ferry pull out. Son of a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I go down to where people are loading pirogues to cross over and try to get in one. The guy first tries ignoring me and when I actually put my foot on the boat he tells me I can&apos;t go. I ask why, but he just goes back to ignoring me. I really wanted to know some Wolof so I could call him nasty names. As it was, all I could do was more glaring. I went over to the bank and sulked for a bit over the bad start my day was off to.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Eventually though I made it across. The Senegalese police were no problem at all. I made it to the garage and into a car pretty quick. There was another half hour wait for the car to fill, but there were lots of beggar kids around who I entertain myself by carrying on one sided conversations in English with them. It&apos;s sort of like talking to plants except the baffled looks make it much more entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Afternoon&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I rolled into Saint Louis about 13h and found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saintlouisdusenegal.com/sleeping.htm&quot;&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt; and the pool at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotel-mermoz.com&quot;&gt;Mermoz&lt;/a&gt;. I splashed around for a bit with the birthday girl and another volunteer before we headed back to our hotel on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Once back at the hotel we found the Kaolack crew already checked in and waiting for us. I was pleased to get to see Leah again. I&apos;ve not seen her since the Kaolack party (at the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/32168.html&quot;&gt;Nikola-Kolba trip&lt;/a&gt; I never finished writing up). Our interactions have always been interesting because we share two unfortunate characteristics: neither of us knows exactly what we&apos;re doing and both of us deal with that by pulling back and being quiet. It makes for lots of uncomfortable silences whenever we see each other.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I&apos;d not eaten since my nyechna the night before, so I broke out the first of Kathleen&apos;s presents: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulker.com.tr/ulkerportal/en/products/product_group/product_detail.cfm?agid=150&amp;amp;id=1306&amp;amp;sayfa=11&quot;&gt;Apple Biskrem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulker.com.tr/ulkerportal/en/products/product_group/default.cfm?id=39&amp;amp;sayfa=11&quot;&gt;Biskrem&lt;/a&gt; are tasty cookies from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ulker.com.tr&quot;&gt;Ülker&lt;/a&gt; in Turkey. There is a chocolate variety that is pretty easy to find in both Mauritania and Senegal. In the RIM though we have other rare and elusive varieties of krems. One of our big grocery stores recently got a shipment of apple at just about the same time that K told me that was what she wanted from Mauritania. There are fig as well, but I&apos;ve not seen them since some serendipitously showed up at a shop as I was stuffing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nalgene-outdoor.com&quot;&gt;Nalgene&lt;/a&gt; with sweets to send to Leah a couple months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Evening&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I stole some of the Biskrem, but I was still pretty hungry and so we went en masse to find some eats. Our restaurant of choice was closed so we opted for beer and waiting. I grabbed a sandwich from a street vendor since dumping beer into my empty stomach would have been less than bright. We sat around and I mostly listened to stories about people I didn&apos;t know. A couple times the conversation would turn to parties I&apos;d been to, but it was mostly gossip.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After an hour and three beers our restaurant was open so we got cleaned up and headed out. Beers generally run about 1000cfa apiece, so I had already spent 3000cfa ($6) or about double my daily budget in Nouakchott. Our restaurant was pretty nice and so I asked the waiter for the cheapest most filling thing. He apparently only get the cheap part since he came back with a few pieces of lettuce and some emaciated popcorn shrimp. Fortunately, I split a bottle of wine with K which, when combined with the previous beers, kept me from caring very much.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Night&quot;&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We went back to the bar that we were at before and met up with an Englishman and his friend. Mostly it was more talking. K and the Englishman set off on a discussion of development that was interesting, but decidedly not my cup of tea at that point. The truth of the matter is that lots of people were starving to death right at that moment and there&apos;s pretty much nothing that can be done about it. Different development and aid programs are going to change things, but some people are going to die in any case, and any solution is both complex and time consuming. I try not to think about those people when trying to have a good time because though it is important, it is also horribly depressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After a bit and me wandering out for fresh air a couple of times I went and got my CDs. I&apos;ve got a mix that started with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/27551.html&quot;&gt;St. Paddy&apos;s Day party&lt;/a&gt; and has been evolving since. The dance moment of the evening definitely belonged to K with her moving performance to that hallmark of the early 90&apos;s: Sir Mix Alot&apos;s &lt;i&gt;Baby Got Back&lt;/i&gt;. It was amazingly entertaining and inspiring to the point that I even got up and danced a bit to Lil&apos; John&apos;s &lt;i&gt;Get Low&lt;/i&gt; even though I was with a bunch of relative strangers; an environment where I generally try not to make a fool of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The rest of the evening is a bit fuzzy. I remember paying for four more beers (which is who it&apos;s fuzzy) and heading back to the hotel. I managed to corner Leah in the bathroom and chat for a bit. Being slightly lit helped me with my whole lack of confrontation thing and we talked for a bit. She was a little miffed at the frivolity of our recent correspondence. I apologized and told her I&apos;d been shooting for frivolous because I thought that was what I was supposed to do. I yet again professed my cluelessness and got her to beat my head against the wall a bit. This was entertaining for me and I&apos;m pretty sure confusing to her.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I went to bed cursing both my complete inability to be suave and her attractiveness which made the situation significantly more depressing.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                            
&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

			<event>&lt;p&gt;This last weekend has absolutely worn me down. Nothing especially intriguing happened, I&apos;ve just been running about and I&apos;m just tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Friday&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday night there were a bunch of people in town for a girls&apos; conference. There&apos;d been sessions and meetings and whatnot all week for about fifty Mauritanian high school girls and their Peace Corp volunteer chaperones. The conference ended and most of the volunteers escorted their charges back to their sites, but there were a few people left around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all got together, did a little drinking and then headed out to the Salamander. The DJ has been getting better in recent months, but he was not doing especially well. I was looking for some techno or hip hop, you know, dance music. All that he was doing though was some salsa and Arabic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did get to be a bootlegger and that was entertaining. I had a bottle of whiskey and bottle of vodka in my little backpack and people&apos;d buy mixers and I&apos;d spike it up for them. The fact that I&apos;d smuggled the booze across international borders made it all the more entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatively early in the evening a googly chunk of our group called it quits. The music wasn&apos;t really grabbing me and I was thinking about doing the same. Lewis grabbed me though and said I ought to hang around for a couple more songs, so I did. They did a bit better and I got a bit of dancing in. The place wasn&apos;t really doing very well though and relatively soon we headed to the VIP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, most of us did. Marc stayed back to try and convince an alluring Spanish senorita to accompany us. Things did not work out apparently since he arrived at the club alone about ten minutes later. They&apos;d not checked my bag at the door, so I got to continue my reign as goto guy. I still wasn&apos;t really entertained. The music was more danceable, but so incredibly loud that I thought my ears were going to start bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group dynamic had also shifted significantly. Nate and Cailin were occupied conoodling on the dance floor. Marc and Lewis were busy working their respective brands of magic on Jenny. I was left pretty much to my own devices. My recent frustrations in Saint Louis left me not really feeling like hitting on anyone. I especially did not feel like hitting on Jenny. She is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gorgeous&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;flirtatious&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fickle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas I am:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gawking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pliable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;melodramatic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a definite recipe for me to spend time being dramatic. It is a habit I am working hard to break with limited success. In any case I&apos;d definitely not put myself in competition with Marc and Lewis who have had more sex in the last two months than I have in my whole twenty-seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I sat down for a bit, had a cigarette and another drink and waited to see if the music would grab me. That last drink was a bad idea. It put me over the line and I felt myself go. I definitely didn&apos;t feel like hanging around at that point so I packed up my booze bag and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what is decidedly one of my larger displays of impropriety, I stopped on the side of the road to have a brief sit down. I sent Miranda a text and told her that if I wasn&apos;t home by morning to come find me on the side of the road. I was just being funny, but then I decided to lie back and the next thing I know some fellow in a boubou is kicking me telling me I can&apos;t sleep here. I was mortified and apologized profusely before a taxi happened by and saved me further embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got out of the taxi Lewis walked up. It turns out they&apos;d left very shortly after I had and they were at a restaurant by my house having a sandwich. I was still completely hammered and not really in any condition to chat, but I went over and joined them regardless. I was curious how they&apos;d beaten me home. There were conflicting reports as to how exactly it happened but Jenny had left and the boys shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miranda texted me at that point and asked if I was alright. As I was responding Marc wandered off. When he came back he informed us there was an excellent place to be sick right around the corner. I&apos;d never really been sick intentionally before, but when I checked I felt like I could and I&apos;ve heard it is better to do that than be hung over the next day. So, I figured what the hell and went and puked. Not that difficult or traumatic all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wandered back home after that and crashed. An examination of my phone the next day showed there was less than ten minutes between my message to M telling her I was sitting down and my subsequent message saying that I was fine and headed home. So, the guy must have come up to me as soon as I lay back. It was just horribly embarrassing, as I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Gifting&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The next morning we got up at a leisurely hour and wandered town a bit. Not before I played Santa a bit more and gave K the copies of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684841215/mentorreadingsug/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;Something Happened&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055337849X/mentorreadingsug/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;The Brothers K&lt;/a&gt; that I&apos;d brought for her. When we hung out before we discussed both aging and that she collects good books. I figured these would make good additions to her collection. I also gave Leah a little wooden Moroccan pot filled with pepto-bismol tablets. She was initially posted to Morocco before it was evacuated and so the pot was a safe bet. The pepto was off of a conversation where she may or may not have been joking about liking them. Either way, I thought it was a quirky, but not too weird gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I&apos;ve found I really like giving gifts. I like shopping and the acquisition of stuff. I like hunting through the stalls of trinkets and from time to time I even like bargaining. I don&apos;t really have the attention span though to maintain a large collection of brik-a-brak for myself. Giving gifts let&apos;s me shop and make my friends happy all at once. Granted, certain of my friends ought make out with me upon reception of their gifts, I think, but I like doing it even without the physical expression of appreciation. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;We went by one of the nicer stores on the island: a fair-trade shop called Keur Fall. We were secretly hunting for something for K. They had lots of cool stuff and Leah got a very fetching orange beret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Stewing&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;At the pool I hid out under the umbrella for a good bit. My skin hadn&apos;t seen the light of day for a couple months before the previous day&apos;s pool excursion and I was currently working an very convincing overripe tomato impression. I was in a bit of a mood and sulked by the pool with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385720955/mentorreadingsug/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;The Blind Assassin&lt;/a&gt; and practiced my writing a bit more, this time in the key of Faulkner&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Drama flows through my veins. Melodrama to be exact. Much as I try to rid myself of it, I have been as of late unable. It stems, I think, from the uncertainty that I doubt I&apos;ll ever be able to shake. My ideas don&apos;t get played out directly; instead they bounce around my head for a while losing their touch with reality: becoming epic. She doesn&apos;t adore me, she doesn&apos;t hate me. The truth is mottled and complex, but as I sit here stewing rather than out there really living things are getting too simple. When things finally break free I can tell that they&apos;ve come unmoored from what is, but I&apos;m hard pressed to do anything about it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;It is apparently my job to stop the thinking and drive the action. I don&apos;t fault her the responsibility, I just suck at at. Last night we spent far too much time talking and none at all kissing. I don&apos;t like this drama. I don&apos;t want my life and my feelings played out in my head and spoken on my voice. That pale shadow of reality. That reflection of the moon on the water. I just want it to fall away. Live and be consumed! Blah, blah, blah... If wishes were raindrops this&apos;d not be a desert&amp;hellip;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Since I knew I needed to get off my ass and go talk with everyone, I eventually did. Most of the conversation still escapes me since it concerned people and places I didn&apos;t know, but I did manage the occasional interjection about their desert neighbor to the north. Everyone was really friendly and I enjoyed hearing the stories even if I wasn&apos;t up to my usual loquaciousness. After we&apos;d been there a bit a few more of the girls from the Fouta showed up and brought a good deal of energy along with them. Our crowd surpassed ten now with a combined travel time of around forty hours to be there. It was an impressive show of affection and I told K as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Preparing&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The Kaolack crew and I headed out from the pool a bit early to run a few errands. Dell headed back to Keur Fall to pick up K&apos;s present while Justin and Leah went to retrieve the cake they&apos;d brought from Kaolack: enter Africa&apos;s ability to muddle the best laid of plans&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Kaolack&apos;s cake was a wonder of American culinary skill. Easily a foot in diameter it had the shape of a heart to represent the world&apos;s love of Kathleen. When they&apos;d gotten it into town after a harrowing five hour ride on Leah&apos;s lap, they gave it to the care of the hotel staff to refrigerate while waiting for the party. The ownership of the Hotel Harmattan has recently changed hands from an industrious Frenchman to an elderly Lebanese couple. By coincidence the son of the Lebanese couple also lives in Saint Louis and owns a pâtisserie down the street. When they got up in the morning and discovered a giant heart shaped cake in their fridge they were touched by what they assumed to be their dear grandson&apos;s surprise. They must have been touched all the way down to their stomachs because they ate a good five slices of cake between them. The Lebanese style of cake cutting is a bit less ordered than our finicky Western methods, so there&apos;s a jagged round chunk missing right out of the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Sufficit to say, Justin and Leah were less than pleased at this defacing of their culinary masterpiece. I missed the initial confrontation, but Leah was uncharacteristically pissed when she made it back to the room. The contrite grandson did a bit to soothe her anger when he offered to give them a replacement cake from his pâtisserie. There was nearly a second conflict when the Lebanese couple attempted to appropriate the as of yet unseen uneaten parts of the heart cake because it was &quot;delicious.&quot; This suggestion was met with surprising fury on Leah&apos;s part. The remnants of the cake were soon returned to their creatress who grumbled a bit about lesbians and frogs, but seemed to be calming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Dressing&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Everyone else came back a bit after and other than some giggling that had to go unexplained as the cake was iced, Kathleen was none the wiser about the preparations for the evening. Since this was to be our nice night out &lt;i&gt;donc, il faut s&apos;endimancher, n&apos;est pas?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Everyone was in rare form, but there were a few shining stars that come to mind. The birthday girl herself was wearing a lovely red and white floral print that did an excellent job of accentuating her finer points.The outfit was drawn together very well by a string of faux pearls that she&apos;d received as a present earlier in the day. Leah had a light green ensemble, also in a floral motif, and with ruffled elastic back on the shirt reminiscent of her senorita outfit from the Kaolack party. She was certainly looking good, but this was just an appetizer for her true hotness which was to blossom later in the evening. Marie Elsie nearly took the prize for most striking outfit with a pink tie-back halter top than was guaranteed to leave some unsuspecting fellow with whiplash before the end of the evening. In the end modesty or good sense won out and she put on a shirt under it which did a lot to mute the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The gents, of which we were two, did our best to look presentable to escort this bevy of beauties. Justin managed it with a cotton striped shirt that brought out both his height and build. He looked debonair without being aloof; a versatile escort capable of pleasuring the mind with scintillating dinner conversation and later pleasuring the body with a firm but tender touch. I myself was a bit rougher in appearance. I was wearing my traditional Saint Louis dancing ensemble of Malian print pants, gray wife-beater and a blue button down shirt worn open. I tried to leave my hair uncovered, but eventually thoughts of having been called a &quot;poodle&quot; and &quot;mushroom&quot; wormed their way into my psyche and I covered it with a bandanna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Dining&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Dinner was at La Saigon: a delicious Thai restaurant at the end of the island where we all stuffed ourselves on delicious curries and lo meins. K received a couple more gifts: a very nice handbag from Keur Fall and a fancy mulafa from myself. I&apos;d never purchased a nice mulafa before and something that I learned is that the top of the line ones have little braids and buttons at one of the corners that are the signature of the artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;A couple of our girls had already had a bit to drink and they&apos;d call the waiter (with whom they were familiar) with alluring cries of &quot;Oh Oooousemaaannn...&quot; For a very black man he&apos;d manage to turn quite pink. To help everyone to get on the same page we had a couple rounds of saki shots. Ever sensitive to the ambiance our proprietess provided us with little ceramic shot bowls. The base of each was a curved lens that normally distorted the light, but when filled with a clear liquid, such as saki, became transparent to reveal a nude figure lounging in the bottom of the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Drinking&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After dinner we headed back to the room for a bit. Marie Elsie made a very stiff screwdriver that was literally almost half vodka and she and I nursed that together. I didn&apos;t really get especially drunk given the extent to which I&apos;d imbibed. I think part of the problem was that I&apos;d still not really talked to Leah about where exactly we stood. Running around all day combined with my being a chicken shit just kept it from happening. While we were back at the hotel she changed clothes into a pair of jeans that literally stopped my heart for a beat when I saw them. Those jeans combined with the addition of her orange hat purchased earlier in the day was the perfect blend of spunky and sexy. Her looking as good as she did managed to push my nearly mind numbing chatter of self-recriminations up yet another notch. I took a shot of vodka chased with Red Bull to try and quiet the damned things down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;K&apos;s final present from Leah were a couple of glow sticks that were broken out once we got into the club. Our group was in a big circle and as the sticks would move from person to person you&apos;d take the spotlight for a bit in the center. Tara was likely the best contestant with her flowing and sensual moves reminiscent of an arcane ritualistic dance out of ancient Egypt. The most entertaining was a random Wolof woman who joined our circle dressed in full boubou regalia and did a tawdry seduction of a distressed looking Frenchman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The music was pretty good, but I wasn&apos;t being grabbed by anything. I was sort of pissed that just as the glow sticks found their way into my hands the music changed to a Senegalese m&apos;balach. A perfectly fine and acceptable form of musical expression, just one with a beat so complex that it generally just confuses me and I end up flailing like an epileptic if I attempt it for any length of time. I passed the sticks off to Ouseman from the restaurant who had apparently been captured by the Siren calls of Kim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Eventually my courage and a good song lined up with 50&apos;s &lt;i&gt;Candyshop&lt;/i&gt; and managed to get in a bit of dancing with Leah. Some time after that I told her that I&apos;d really like to get to get a word with her if she had a chance. After a bit we did head out and we did get to talk a bit. The conversation was mostly me raving and her trying not to fall asleep. I didn&apos;t really leave with any more of a clue than I came in with other than the knowledge that we wouldn&apos;t be hooking up that weekend and it would be best that if we ever manage to catch up again that we do so in a setting where it is just us two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;How I feel about the whole bit is muddled. I think she is beautiful and I&apos;m definitely interested in her. We have a unfortunate tendence toward awkwardness in our group interactions though. At this point I&apos;m willing to just let things play out as they will. I&apos;ve pretty much said where I stand, so the ball&apos;s in her court. I figure I&apos;ve done a pretty good job of being both nice and cool to date, so however it works out I did what I could and that&apos;ll have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

			<subject>Crazy Town</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I was going to let my weekend description stand with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/39991.html&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;, but my recent visit to crazy town needs a bit of background&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Salsa&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Most of Saturday I spent in bed with my cat Hoover sleeping off the goodly quantity of booze that hit me so hard the night before. Once nightfall finally rolled around though I was at about 90% and the 15 or so hours of sleep I&apos;d gotten kept me from just calling it a night. So instead I headed back to the Salamander for a bit of Salsa dancing. To be honest this wouldn&apos;t have been my first choice given my lack of coordination, but I figured I&apos;d give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Before heading out, a volunteer wanted drop by my place and borrow some clothes from Miranda. My history with this particular girl has been furtive flirtation from time to time and I&apos;d talked with Miranda about how exactly one can distinguish the difference between someone just being flirty and someone being actually interested. Well, as I was to learn later in the evening, M decided to help me out and ask straight out if she was interested in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I didn&apos;t find this out until later in the evening though. We went out and danced a bit. Salsa can be an absolutely beautiful dance when performed properly. I found that I liked the music, but I was not good enough at coordinating my movements with another person to really enjoy it. A couple dances I got out and just grooved on my own and that was fun. At the end of the evening they put on some hip-hop and techno, and I got in some dancing more akin to what I generally enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Rant&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Things wrapped up around 2 and M and I headed home. It was along the walk that she revealed her earlier discussion and the fact that this other volunteer wasn&apos;t interested in me. I was nonplussed in general. I think she&apos;s cute, but we deal with our emotional lives in very different ways. I was pretty sure that she&apos;d find my as frivolous as I found her evasive, so this was no great shock. It did however bring up the subject of romance and got me started on the subject of Leah and my frustrations from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/40395.html&quot;&gt;past weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;It was nothing terribly specific, just a general lament on emotionality and romance and all that jazz. As much as anything it was a commentary on the role of emotional intimacy in a relationship and whether it was possible to do something that was both temporary but which still has a meaningful emotional connection. Largely I was just rambling and wishing for a relatively emotionally stable girl to have fun with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Fast forward to the next evening. After a really irritating day dealing with the University administration, I go out to see Annika off. It is a sad evening, both because Annika is cool and because I&apos;m with her sitemates, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mollytania.diaryland.com&quot;&gt;Molly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://livejournal.com/~calebjudy/&quot;&gt;Caleb&lt;/a&gt;, and they&apos;re both really upset. I show up back at the house around 1:30 in a somber mood to find the entire place lit by candles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Seduction&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;M meets me in the hallway dressed in a lowcut black evening gown. She asks me about my evening and I tell her that I&apos;ve just seen Annika off and that I&apos;m feeling a bit blue. I emphasize my depressed emotional state a bit more than I would have otherwise since there&apos;s a certain mood in the air and I want to break it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Don&apos;t get me wrong, M is an attractive girl. She&apos;s incredibly nice as well; often to the point of letting people take advantage of her. Her priorities in life just aren&apos;t such that I&apos;d be interested in seriously dating her. The role that I can tell emotion plays in her sexuality means that us hooking up would very likely be bad news for both of us. All of this stuff combines for me enjoying being friends with her, but having no real desire for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;As round the corner to my room, my sense of mood is confirmed. All about the room there are candles adorning every available flat surface. Their flicking glow illuminated a red satin scarf that is lain across the bed with rose petals scattered on it. The headboard is decorated with a garland of white roses. In the background there is soft jazz playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;It was very well done. Had I been teetering, she would have gotten to my romantic side and I would have likely succumbed. I even had a moment when I considered giving in. I really do have sympathy for the romance in M as well as deep respect for anyone willing to put themselves out there and make a move on someone. Unfortunately, sympathy and respect are not attraction and it still would have been a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;This however left me in a position of &quot;yeah, I said I was lonely and horny and I just struck out with the only girl I&apos;ve had anything to do with in the last six months, but we&apos;re still not going to do this.&quot; How does one communicate this to someone without being hurtful? Me? I played dumb. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I told her truthfully that she&apos;d done a beautiful job of decorating the house and that everything looked wonderful. I completely ignored the general romantic connotations of soft jazz and strewing rose petals. I figured this was a way to say, &quot;I see what you&apos;ve done and I respect it, but I don&apos;t think this is a good idea.&quot; She could just play it off and let it slide. I understand that she and I are good friends and I respect her wanting to change things, I just don&apos;t feel it. She and I just stood around talking. She wasn&apos;t making a move physically, but she wasn&apos;t heading to bed either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Evasion&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After a bit Hoover came in to sleep with me and curled up in the middle of the scarf. I went over and started to play with her and rolled her up in the scarf efficiently removing it from the bed. Next I sat down on one side of the bed and mentioned being really tired and a bit drunk from the shots of whiskey I&apos;d had at Annika&apos;s farewell. In retrospect the drunk bit should probably have best been kept to myself as M then came and sat down on the other side from me. We continued to talk about this and that for a bit, but as time progressed we went from a conversation to M monologuing and me interjecting with &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;uh-huh&quot; from time to time. Eventually I was lulled to sleep by the sound of her talking and awoke to find the candles blown out and myself with a general sense that perhaps I could have done something more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Ok, forward once more, this time two days. I get up and head to the University to work a bit. Round about 17h I get a call from someone saying that there&apos;s some Gambian volunteers in town and can I put them up? I say sure and as I&apos;m going to meet them I send a message to M just to tell her I may be having guests and does she mind? To my surprise, I arrive at home to find the house empty. M has an amazing collection of trinketry from all over Africa and Europe. It is all gone as are the twenty or so shelves of books and CDs that are normally in the living room. I was shocked and befuddled. If nothing else than just by the fact that someone had managed to move an amazing amount of crap in the five hours since I&apos;d gone to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Amiss&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Sensing that something was amiss, I started hunting for another place to stick the Gambians. While doing this I got a message from M in response to my request to have guests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align: justify; margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 15%; border: 2px solid; padding: 1em&quot;&gt;U told me in the nick o&apos; time cuz the furniture as about to exit the house. FYI, I&apos;ve had more than enuff + i understand that your finances  don&apos;t permit u 2 find some place cheaper. U &amp;amp; Richie the socko can stay 4 the 2 mnths left in the contract. I&apos;m not responsible 4 u guys after that. However I&apos;m moving out NOW. So u do whatever u want cuz it&apos;s already more your place than mine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align: justify; margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 15%; border: 2px solid; padding: 1em&quot;&gt;Oh and  one more thing&amp;hellip; the signs will be OBVIOUS when you walk in but in case of doubt, you are warned in writing: THE countdown is on&amp;hellip;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Ooookaay. You&apos;d think that based on this message she&apos;d maybe mentioned me moving at some point in the past. You&apos;d think that perhaps we&apos;d not been friendly and talking and spending a lot of time together. I&apos;d known she was pissed at Richard and rightly so since he&apos;s an asshole. I think the quote that best characterized him is when he said to her, &quot;It&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;ve been with a woman and I&apos;m getting to the point I&apos;m so horny that I&apos;d do you even though you&apos;re so fat and dark.&quot; (M is Mauritian and so looks Indian (dot not feather).)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;So, to deal with houseguests that she was no longer interested in having, she didn&apos;t tell them that she wanted them to move and instead simply moves out herself. There is a certain logic there if you were passive-aggressive to the border of insanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Things are getting too weird even for me. So I start lining up places to stick my stuff and start trying to find a place to live. (Within a day someone I hadn&apos;t talked to in a couple months calls me up and asks me if I&apos;ve got furniture to sell. I ask why and he says he&apos;s getting married in December and he&apos;s trying to furnish an apartment his family gave him. He says I can stay there for free if I teach computer lessons to his boss&apos;s son. How convenient.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Explanation&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;That night after going to talk to come people in the 5�me about a place out there I get home and finally get to talk to M face to face. I ask her if she&apos;s moving and she says, &quot;kinda.&quot; I ask her why and she says, &quot;I want to.&quot; After a couple more similarly noninformational responses I give up on her actually saying anything useful. I tell her that I&apos;m sorry for having imposed her and that I was really unaware that she wanted me to move. I tell her I thought that she and I were cool and that it was never my intention to make her uncomfortable. I sort of left it open for her to apologize for never saying anything at all about wanting me to leave and then acting nuts and moving all of her stuff out without any notice, but all I got was an &quot;I accept your apology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;So, I let it go and continue getting ready to move. The next day I go to work again and this time when I come back there&apos;s a letter posted on the Frenchman&apos;s door. I only read the first couple lines which were something along the lines of &quot;you&apos;ve got to move because you are a intolerable repugnant racist bastard asshole...&quot; and the list just kept going. I just can&apos;t let this pass and want to get pictures of the washing machine manifesto and basket&apos;o&apos;porn, so I head to Carl&apos;s to borrow his camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Creepy&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;When I come back some decoration has reentered the house. There&apos;s now a large Moroccan knife unsheathed on the kitchen table in front of a Halloween candle in the form of a bloody severed hand. By where I hang my keys there&apos;s a sign that says, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Qu&apos;attendez-vous? Votre temps est compte non en jours mais en heures&amp;hellip&lt;/i&gt;&quot; (&quot;What are you waiting for? Your time is measured not hours, not days&amp;hellip;&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;To date I&apos;d been debating as to whether what was going on was a clumsy, but effective assertion of M&apos;s boundaries and thereby her sanity. Or if she was simply going nuts. This was a big vote for looney tunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Her sense of humor has always been a bit morbid. On one of her trips to Dakar she bought a bunch of dried lizard and bat heads and dessicated moneys&apos; paws. I thought they were odd, but didn&apos;t really care. She would also occasionally crack a joke about coming into my room at night and thinking about cuttng my throat. It was odd and a bit creepy, but I just chalked it up to a warped sense of humor. Recently developments were making it quite a bit more disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Last night I went home and the candles were out again, but this time for a big French fellow she was entertaining. I decided to leave them to their own devices and crashed at a hotel with another volunteer. I&apos;m getting my stuff moved out today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;What&apos;s odd is that in the five minutes between when I came into the house and when I was ready to go again my keys disappeared. I would swear I&apos;d left them on the kitchen table when I walked in, but when I was ready to go they weren&apos;t there. Normally I&apos;d think I was being paranoid, but I seriously wonder if M took them. The fact that I&apos;m really not sure just shows how bad I need to get out of there. My office keys are on that key ring though, so I need to get them one way or another, so the drama isn&apos;t done just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

			<event>I have a variety of more important things to write about, but our &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.google.com/?ncl=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/08/03/mauritania/&amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt; has me stuck in the bureau and I&apos;ve been wasting time on the internet all morning since I&apos;m not supposed to go anywhere.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegesexadvice.com/sex-iq.shtml&quot;&gt;SAT: Sex Aptitude Test&lt;/a&gt; really entertained me. I got a 17. Apparently, I&apos;m a sex genius. &amp;#x263A;</event>

				<subject>re: coup</subject>
				<body>Yeah, everything is fine here. We&apos;ve got people driving around in big groups blowing their horns and waving flags and whatnot. Pretty much exactly the same as after Maaouiya won the last presidential election. The atmosphere is very much, &quot;the king is dead, long live the king.&quot; Other than things being boring since we&apos;re not supposed to wander around much everything&apos;s normal.

The military commission which is running the place now is in power because the old regime was too hard on the Islamists. How this is going to play out for my life here will be interesting if nothing else. I&apos;m just hoping they don&apos;t kick us out.</body>

			<subject>Parti</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Things are wrapping up for a lot of my friends here. Saturday we did a big beach party for my groups of volunteers that are getting ready to head out. That went really well. No especially good gossip material, but we kept the dance floor going all night long. &lt;lj user=&quot;adrianapublico&quot;&gt; in particular kept things going. She left at one point then came back and danced for a couple more hours until the closers all went for a sunrise swim followed by Café Touba, Kinkaliba and sandwiches down at the port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the next two days recuperating broken by a trip to the gym. When I was there I met a fellow who knelt down beside me while I was doing sit-ups and shook my hand. He looked at my face closely and said, &quot;hi, my name is Ismiel, do you remember me?&quot; I had no idea who he was. I looked at the fellow and he sparked no recognition whatsoever, so I told him, &quot;no.&quot; &quot;Think carefully,&quot; he said, &quot;you sure you don&apos;t remember?&quot; I tried hard, but I assumed he was just some random guy I&apos;d met at the University, so I tried that as a guess. &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;I was at the VIP with you.&quot; &quot;Ok,&quot; I thought, &quot;I&apos;ve met him in the VIP. Cool.&quot; So, I shook his hand and told him my name. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, &quot;I was with you a week ago. You were really drunk. I saw you leave and then I left and I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/39991.html&quot;&gt;helped you&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &quot;Shit,&quot; I thought as I turned two shades of pink. Great, just great. &quot;Thank you very much Ismiel, I appreciate what you did very much. You are very nice. Umm, I gotta go now.&quot; Wherever you go, there you are; sometimes life just sees fit to remind you of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was the last time I was going to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projecttrust.org.uk&quot;&gt;the British girls&lt;/a&gt;. I went over to their house and &lt;lj user=&quot;cazinmauritania&quot;&gt; made tcheub-u-jeen. It took a bit longer than expected, but round about 0H30 when we finally ate it was well worth the wait. Caz&apos;s sister was in town and she made the mistake of mentioning to me that she&apos;d been trying to go out, but had been unsuccessful in convincing her hostesses to take her out. I felt it was my moral obligation to fill out this poor girl&apos;s Mauritania experience with a taste of the nightlife. She was resistant at first, but mine and Lewis&apos; combined efforts along with some momentum from Em got her out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VIP is an experience best had at least slightly fucked up, so we valiant four went off in search of some booze. I have a bottle of tequila I&apos;ve been saving for an occasion and this seemed appropriate. Unfortunately, my recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ivankara/40479.html&quot;&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; left it at Carl&apos;s house. This is not a problem in and of itself except for the fact that it&apos;s 2H30 and Carl is likely fast asleep. Barging into someone&apos;s home at 3 in the morning is not a nice way to repay them for letting you store stuff there. So, instead we decide to break in and steal the alcohol without waking Carl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl has a second floor veranda that is open and that, it turns out, Lewis can reach when standing on my shoulders. The one problem is there is a guard that sleeps by the door. So, we walk up and Em uses her broken Hassaniya and a variety of hand gestures to communicate, &quot;we left our keys inside and have to climb in.&quot; His response is, &quot;Huh?&quot; then, &quot;the guy that lives there is sleeping.&quot; We simply pulled the white card at that point and started to climb the wall. The guy looked at us, but other than watching us with a bemused look, didn&apos;t do anything. Lewis made it up to the balcony alright, but as he poked his head over the banister Carl&apos;s voice came in response, &quot;don&apos;t even think about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that Carl was sleeping on the veranda. He didn&apos;t come down to let us in so we decided to leave him lie. It was in this dejected and deplorably sober state that we rolled into the VIP. Things were going pretty well. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2paclegacy.com&quot;&gt;Tupac&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s birthday, so the place was pretty well packed. For whatever reason the DJ thought playing Senegalese dance music would be a fitting tribute to &apos;pac. Not even the Senegalese were dancing though. It was pretty sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put down 3500um on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heineken.com&quot;&gt;Heineken&lt;/a&gt; for Helen and a gin and tonic for myself. This reminded me of why I dropped more money in one night out with a girl in Paris than in the previous week. To be a good host though was well worth it. We gave the DJ two songs to stop sucking and we were going to head. After two crappy songs, I still wanted to go out for one dance, so we gave it the old college try. We lasted until a mediocre hip-hop set and didn&apos;t leave until about 4H30 when I went back with the girls since I&apos;m currently homeless.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Coup</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;So, we&apos;ve had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/bfaada0931b831693c1bbd1eb786e88a.htm&quot;&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt;. Ould Taya is out and Ould Abdel Aziz is in. I want to write about it, by my writing is crap today, so I&apos;ll give the news to you as most of it came to me: though a string of text messages from Miranda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To give a brief background, I went to the airport at about 7H to see Helen off. When we arrived they wouldn&apos;t let anyone in and they wouldn&apos;t let us within 40 feet of the building. I sat there until about 9H chatting and then Em and I gave up and headed out. Along our way we had to detour because there were guys with machine guns blocking one of the roads. This has happened before though, so I just figured that it was something official going on. Before I made it home though I got a call from my &lt;acronym title=&quot;Associate Peace Corps Director&quot;&gt;APCD&lt;/acronym&gt; asking where I was and what I was doing. That&apos;s the first time that&apos;s happened, so my curiosity was piqued. I got to Marc&apos;s to find him asleep and unconcerned. I figured I&apos;d catch a little sleep and as I was lying there these messages were coming in. Marc&apos;s response to the report of a coup was, &quot;Damn, I hope the gym isn&apos;t closed today, I really want to go.&quot; Miranda was a bit more excitable, as you will see. My response is closer to Marc&apos;s, all in all, as none of these messages roused me from bed until about 14H.&lt;/p&gt;

Contact&lt;/span&gt; buro &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; for update. Please b very careful in town, as u may know, the day b4 yesterday Prez Maouya went 2 Saoudi Arabia to attend King Fahad&apos;s funeral, last nite 99% ministers  military agreed on peaceful &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;coup d&apos;etat&lt;/span&gt; so no military is out on the streets! The emb and no one knows &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;who&lt;/span&gt; is new Prez. Probably Islamists. Practically &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;everything is closed&lt;/span&gt;. Kindly &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;fw&lt;/span&gt; this msg!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/03 09&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;46&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;Everyone&lt;/span&gt; on the streets who dares go out speak in hushed tones excited and scared about &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;who&lt;/span&gt; is now in charge and &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; this will affect all?! I&apos;m now hitting the streets in black mulafa to learn more. We are living in exciting times Will darling! They attempt to pass info on. If u feel safer @ my place, Bismillah! But take a cab please altho hard to come by 2day!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I sent a message at this point asking if the coup had been successful since there have been two unsuccessful ones since I&apos;ve been here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/03 09&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Yes, since they won&apos;t let prez back and general population is fed up with general situation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/03 10&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;02&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;US Emb wants us to keep low key and stay put until they and we know &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;who&lt;/span&gt; is in control and &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; this will affect us. We must prepare for eventual &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;evacuation&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;soon&lt;/span&gt; as in the 24/48 hrs to come if it turns out we as americans and all westerners arte threatened. USAF Military are on stand-by and we are all in mode and code &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;red (high alert)&lt;/span&gt; I can&apos;t believe warden system didn&apos;t contact u yet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/03 10&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;09&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt; are you? Just in case &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;emb&lt;/span&gt; needs me to contact u and phone system shuts down&amp;hellip;! &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;radio&lt;/span&gt; already taken over by new govt. Logically, Mauritel and Mattel are &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; to better control population and prevent potential retaliation since not everyone is thrilled about having the rug pulled from under them!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/03 13&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;Pls FW Myra&apos;s Coup Update: Maouya&apos;s plane made emergency landing in Niger. &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;All&lt;/span&gt; incoming/outgoing flights suspended. &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt; borders have been shut. All Chefs d&apos;Etat Major (military chiefs of staff) under artrest. TV &amp;amp; Radio, Palais de Congres &amp;amp; all Ministries under lock&apos;n key &amp;amp; guarded.

Military Army regime now officially in power so US Emb says 18pm &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;curfew&lt;/span&gt; is probable. &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;No&lt;/span&gt; official declaration as yet. French and US ask their citizens to stay home. &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;Keep cellphones on&lt;/span&gt;, charged and with enough credit to text or call for help, have passport money and water ready to get thru the night, lock doors and turn on &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;TV &amp;amp; radio&lt;/span&gt; and keep everyone updated!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/03 18&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;Hope y&apos;all r still safe since my last update&amp;hellip; No curfew as yet from either military govt or US or French Embassies. -Myra burning 1000k Mauritel credit every 2hrs to keep y&apos;all up-to-date every half hr, better than CNN!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/04 8&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;02&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;Myra&apos;s Coup Update: Good Mornin&apos; Nkc! Hope y&apos;all r ok since logged off @ 2am. On da beat again since @ 6:30am. New 12 men all Maure Col. &quot;Comité Militaire pour la Justice &amp;amp; le Démocracie an Mauritanie&quot; officially declared last nite that the next 2 yrs they would bring J&amp;amp;D 2 RIM b4 restoring power to civilians after 21 yrs of totalitarian Maouya.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/04 18&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;Myra Scoop: There r pro Maouya people also honking w Maouya posters and being arrested. Wonderful! Can&apos;t wait 4&amp;hellip;!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;In response to my question of how things were going in town:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/05 16&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;No&lt;/span&gt; all is &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; fine in town. Just appears so. Interesting dangerous dev. US Emb will probably evac u in wk or less. They want 2 cut diplo ties w RIM which has already been deleted from African union. France &amp;amp; EU &amp;amp; UN r also crossing out RIM from World map &amp;amp; pulling out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/06 16&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;Myra&apos;s 4pm Coup Update: Air France has resumed their flights and is landing in NKC w/ passengers as we speak. Long waiting list on both ends as 1st wave of expat evac begins and anxious Mauritanians abroad want to rush home to figure out &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;what&lt;/span&gt; is going on and also flee with families if necessary. Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seatbelts&amp;hellip; We expect major turbulence!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;It is about this time that I get a call from Obie asking if I&apos;m still living with Miranda and when I respond &quot;no,&quot; he tells me he has forbidden her to send her messages to Peace Corps volunteers. I tell him that I&apos;m taking her messages with a grain of salt and I&apos;m not overly concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/06 16&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;Myra&apos;s Coup Update: Immediate reaction to last bulletin: Embassies, Govt Agencies, IO &amp;amp; Intl Companies vehemently deny there is an ongoing expat evac, saying these are exaggerated &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;rumors&lt;/span&gt; and want to reassure us that all is &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;calm&lt;/span&gt;, keep standfast but absolutely &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt; need for panic, go about your business, let&apos;s just wait and see!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: solid 2px; padding:-right: 1em; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;2005/08/06 23&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;Myra&apos;s 00:00 Coup Flash: Rumors continue about Prez Taya hiding in Morocco since yesterday. Moroccan Emb neither confirms nor denies this. Moroccans in Nkc aren&apos;t happy with new uncertainty   worry about having 2 go back home 2 unemployment &amp;amp; an apparently free modern Kingdom where women have less freedom &amp;amp; power than Mauritanian women under Taya&apos;s regime. Will women gain more freedom or go back to Sharia Law of pre-Taya era 21 yrs ago?¿?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;I was out with some guys when this went out and Ricardo sent back a fairly harsh reply about unsubstantiated rumors and gibberish. I personally was entertained by the messages, but he was worried about his position with the EU and it put him a bit on edge.&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>Mauritanian coups are significantly more boring affairs. You&apos;d think that it would at least be mildly interesting with a tank or something, but no, nothing at all. There have been cars full of people riding around in trucks and cars beeping horns and yelling and whatnot. That&apos;s what you do after a wedding though, so it isn&apos;t really strange except in the number of cars.

I don&apos;t know about Jamaica, but everyone here is related to everyone else. Everyone is someone&apos;s cousin or brother or aunt or something. We&apos;ve got some racial tensions, but this coup hasn&apos;t really strained those much since this was essentially all of the president&apos;s cabinet taking over while he was out of the country.</body>

				<subject>Re: coup</subject>
				<body>My coup experience was in Venezuela.  Thankfully.  Your description of the Mr Coup sounds like a calm Jamaican election, except in Ja it lasts for a month of lead-up and increased gang-violence between politically-aligned gangs and inner-city communities.

Same with Ja in the inter-relatedness, it&apos;s a small island.</body>

			<subject>Distractions</subject>
			<event>Still healing mentally from Lewis and Will&apos;s last great adventure. For better or worse, life doesn&apos;t slow down. I&apos;ve been teaching some English as the University is still closed down. Also we&apos;re trying to get where exactly the new trainees are going to be placed and so I&apos;ve been hunting down people trying to give a final recommendation for continuing work with the academy or not.

During site visits we spent most of the time wandering about with Carl looking at his projects. I didn&apos;t have much to show other than getting someone posted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iset-rosso.mr&quot;&gt;ISET&lt;/a&gt; which I picked out.

The last night was supposed to be party night, but no one wanted to go out so I jumped ship and headed to Kaédi early. It took over four hours to make it out of town and I didn&apos;t arrive until around 22h. Within half an hour though I was covered from head to toe with a quarter inch of mud and had begun my reign as mud wrestling champion of Mauritania. The title bout was myself against the whole of the Gorgol region (well, the female bits of it, I&apos;m pretty sure Jae and I would have injured one another). I, in an impressive but not surprising show of guile and fortitude prevailed once again.

The one major issue with Kaédi&apos;s mud wrestling pit is the gravel which covers the bottom. Imagine crawling around on your hands and knees in gravel. Now imagine someone jumping on your back and punching you in the head as you&apos;re crawling around in gravel. This images should help you understand why all of the contestants emerged from the competition with lacerated knees, backs, wrists and elbows.

I spent a couple days hanging out with the trainees and did a couple sessions on various and sundry things. The new group has some pretty cool folks in it. I hate that I&apos;m not really going to be around to get to know them better.

Last night I got to hang out with some people I&apos;d not seen for a while and we got a bit hammered. One fellow dressed up like Ponchus Pilate and let us set him on fire. That was fun.</event>

			<subject>teaching</subject>
			<event>I was born with two unfortunate penchants: melodrama and self-pity. These have gotten a pretty good workout in recent weeks with a couple rather disappointing set of interactions. I could see myself slipping into an unnecessary melancholy, but could find little recourse. The problem has been one of focus. With my job having disintegrated and my friends mostly departed, I had little to occupy my time other than reading, sleeping and ruminating in the torpid waters of my unshed tears.

(You&apos;ll have to forgive me, I just finished Pat Conroy&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0395353009/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;Prince of Tides&lt;/a&gt; whose spellbinding usage of the English language captured me and left me again wishing that I could weave so beautifully.)

In an effort to break this slump I&apos;ve been teaching an English class for the last couple weeks. It is a little conversation class where I come in with an article and we go around the room taking turns reading and discussing. I began with banal and safe articles on subjects such as the growing rise in ethanol use. My students seemed bored though and more importantly I was bored. In an attempt to spice things up a bit, I brought in an article on Israeli settlements in the West Bank in opposition to Sharone&apos;s disengagement plans.

I&apos;ve run across more than a little anti-Sematism here. I&apos;ve seen kids pull their bouboubs up over their heads and dance around chanting, &quot;look at me, I&apos;m a Jew.&quot; I&apos;ve also heard people resort to calling each other Jews at the end of a nasty argument. I was wondering how my students, who are all bilani (white maure), would react.

The first think one of my students said was, &quot;we are cousins; we come from the same place: Jews and Arabs.&quot; Another student, after asking me if I was a Protestant, told me all the religions of the sky (meaning monotheistic ones) were almost the same. He said those Buddhists and Hindus and whatnot were weird, but that we were all ok. (I had lied about being a Taoist. I was looking to spice the class, but that would have endangered its future I think.) He told me that he could marry a Christian woman or even a Jew if he wanted.

The word &quot;apocalyptic&quot; was in the story and we talked a bit about the end of the world which was entertaining as well. He said that in Islam there wouldn&apos;t be a war or anything, just a breath of God and everyone would face judgement.

All in all I am liking the class a lot. My students only seem to recognize my authority in their frequent attempts to usurp it, but so long as I govern with a pretty constant rain of condescension I can keep them in hand.</event>

			<event>I&apos;m stuck at the bureau because I left my phone at home then lent my key to someone. To fill the boredom I am looking up card games. Molly and I have been playing a bit in the evenings but all that she knows are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pagat.com/patience/spitemal.html&quot;&gt;Skipbo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waste.org/~oxymoron/cards/ratscrew.html&quot;&gt;Egyptian Rat Screw&lt;/a&gt;. (I know nothing.)

I have been hunting for good two person games and one I remember playing before is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pagat.com/boston/spades.html&quot;&gt;spades&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn&apos;t remember the rules though.

Start out with the dealing. You alternate between the players. Each draws a card and decides if they want to keep it. If they do then they look at the next card and discard it face down. If they don&apos;t then they discard the card face down and take the next card off the deck. Either way each turn a card is taken and a card is discarded. When the deck is exhausted this will leave both players with thirteen cards.

Spades is a normal trump game where spades are always trump. Suit must always be followed. Spades may not be led until broken or until a player has nothing but spades in his hand. Spades are broken when played on a hand of a different suit (when the player didn&apos;t have that suit).

After the deal each player bids, starting with the player that didn&apos;t draw first, a number of tricks. If you don&apos;t make your bid you lose ten points for each trick you bid. If you make your bid you get ten points for each trick up to your bid and lose ten points for each sandbag or overbid trick. Bidding nil (no tricks) is worth 100 points. Losing the bid though carries a penalty of 100 points. Shooting the moon (all 13 tricks) also has a special value of 200 points. The first person to hit 500 wins. If both hit in the same round, the higher score wins.</event>

			<event>Been a while since I&apos;ve written. I&apos;ve been keeping busy. I&apos;ve just gotten back from watching the newest group of volunteers take their vows down in Kaédi. They seem to be a promising group. Professional and culturally sensitive they also did a good job at their swearing in party. After the group after mine petered out at about 3am during their MTR party I was a bit worried that the illustrious history of debauchery would fall by the wayside. This new group which was on the dance floor en masse for most of the evening brightened my hopes.

I&apos;ve been keeping busy with things in addition to partying in the last little bit. Right before I left I had perhaps the most flattering work days to date.

It began in the morning with a visit to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecodev.mr&quot;&gt;Ecodev&lt;/a&gt; to work with their IT guy and getting the web account sorted out. He went on at length about how glad they were for the site redesign and me walking him through all this stuff.

Then I met up with a friend of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jaydavidson.com&quot;&gt;Jay&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s to help him with some email stuff for his business. He told me that he&apos;d been to the university and talked to people about me. They were apparently very complimentary and he said they liked my teaching alot.

After that I headed off to IMA where I&apos;ve been doing an English class. I needed to talk to the director about what we&apos;re going to do during Ramadan. Currently my class is right at sundown. This is nice for me since it means our two hour class gets a nice fifteen minute break when everyone goes out to pray. For Ramadan though everyone is gonna want to eat at sundown, so it isn&apos;t feasible to do class then. So far as doing it during the day people are just about worthless when it is 115&amp;deg; and you can&apos;t drink anything. So, he wants to try two long classes on the weekends. We&apos;ll see on that.

In any case he spent about ten minutes going on about how much my students liked me. He said they&apos;d been telling him I was the best teacher they&apos;d ever had at IMA. Since I&apos;ve had a couple of friends teach there it made me feel extra special. I do like teaching English. With the Cisco stuff I&apos;d get stuck on the French sometimes even when I knew the technical stuff perfectly. With English I&apos;m always the expert.

To finish off the day I helped a volunteer with some computer problems and made a copy of the mix CD with party songs from the last two years. So far I&apos;ve had eight people ask me for copies including two Africans. One of my many aliases is now DJ Smoove. &amp;#x263A;

All in all I&apos;m still feeling pretty mellow, but it is nice to have days like this which show me that I haven&apos;t completely blown my last two years.

I&apos;m embarking on a new endeavor now. I went out today to look at a room in a house with a family. I&apos;m gonna try to move out of town a ways for Ramadan and do a meditation / focusing sabbatical sort of deal. I&apos;ve wanted to do Ramadan, but not having a family to break fast with sort of defeats the purpose. As much as it is about individual purification it is about community. This way I&apos;ll hopefully get both.</event>

			<event>My previous statement about being able to effectively teach English may have been a bit hasty. Last night I tried to translate the idea of &quot;against the grain&quot; into French. The problem was that I didn&apos;t know the word for grain and talking about the fibers in the wood wasn&apos;t working. I ended up taking a coaster off the table and breaking it in half to demonstrate that going with the grain was easy and against it was hard. Still don&apos;t think they got it.

To try and avoid this tonight I brought my dictionary. It definitely helped with forewarned (présagé) and nail (clou). When I got to expanding (accroître) after attempting to say it six times I had to just give up and write it on the board. French is hard.</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;We are all beautiful. Beautiful beautiful butterflies. Some of us butterflies are just a bit more beautiful beautiful. Like Molly, Miriam, &lt;lj user=&quot;ammedley&quot;&gt; and I when we went out this weekend sporting our new spectacular duds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It began a couple weeks ago when we were all out on a routine visit to the market. Little did we know the wonder and majesty that lay in store. I went to look at some nice wax print from Dakar because I wanted to make some clothes. I was headed to a Lebanese boutique I usually use for my cloth. Alas, on my arrival, I found his shop closed for the afternoon. We continued on our way and finished some other shopping when I thought to drop by one last time to see if he had opened. Praises be, he had in fact arrived in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were coming in as I was struck by a vision in green and red. Like a shimmering iridescent watermelon it called to me. &quot;Give me life,&quot; it said. &quot;Take me and let me walk. I am weak and cannot carry myself. I need a body to take my gloriousness into the world.&quot; I sank to my knees as I choked back a sob. &quot;Andrew,&quot; I croaked, &quot;you have got to make this into a suit.&quot; (I said I was touched, not stupid enough to wear an iridescent watermelon suit.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;lj user=&quot;ammedley&quot;&gt;, showing an uncharacteristic fashion sense, was a bit reluctant to take part. He begged off saying hat he&apos;d look foolish wearing a suit made of this wondrous fabric. Despite my best efforts he could not be disabused of this silly idea. In he end a compromise was struck and he would get one if I also got one and we would wear them out. I was willing, but I was of the opinion that our situation would be much improved if we had some lovely ladies to go out with us. By coincidence we happened to have some lovely ladies with us, but they unfortunately had no attire appropriate for wearing to accompany an iridescent suit. It was therefor decided that they should get dresses made to go with our suits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately there were a variety of iridescent fabrics to choose from. Each was two toned and depending on the light, appeared to be different colors. We took a vote on the colors for each of us and at the end it was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;margin: auto; width: 50%; border: 2px dashed&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;border: 2px solid&quot;&gt;Andrew&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: 2px solid; text-align: center&quot;&gt;green&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: 2px solid; text-align: center&quot;&gt;red&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;border: 2px solid&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: 2px solid; text-align: center&quot;&gt;gold&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: 2px solid; text-align: center&quot;&gt;navy&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;border: 2px solid&quot;&gt;Molly&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: 2px solid; text-align: center&quot;&gt;rose&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: 2px solid; text-align: center&quot;&gt;teal&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;border: 2px solid&quot;&gt;Miriam&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: 2px solid; text-align: center&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: 2px solid; text-align: center&quot;&gt;burnt umber&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;lj user=&quot;ammedley&quot;&gt; and I headed off to a tailleur known for his suits. After calling him and waiting half an hour we were being measured. A chill ran down my spine as I thought of giving this fabric life. At the end he told us that it would take a week and 16000um ($50), but he could do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks pass and Saturday we were all together again from our various travels around Mauritania. There was a brief scare when he said he needed some more time. As planets we hearty four move in erratic orbits and that another propitious alignment would occur was doubtful, especially with my fast approaching disappearance from the scene. Fortunately, a night of hard labor was all that was needed. After an explanation of the seriousness of the matter and a couple thinly veiled threats of violence for good measure, Fall saw his way clear to doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girls had a bit rougher time of it. They both looked stunning, but Molly&apos;s had a slight cleavage problem in that there was a saddening lack. Not that she isn&apos;t well equipped to provide, just the cut of the dress didn&apos;t properly permit. In any case they looked really good and I was more than pleased to get to escort them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began the evening with a dinner at the Saharah Café where we&apos;d gone in the day before and preordered a Lebanese feast. In honor of Molly&apos;s birthday most all of Nouakcott&apos;s volunteers gathered to celebrate. Plates of humos, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, some hushpuppyesque meatballs and other Lebanese delights came rolling out of the kitchen. I stuffed myself into a hummus coma just in time to head to Molly&apos;s for the delicious chocolate cake &lt;lj user=&quot;adrianapublico&quot;&gt; had prepared with coffee. Scott was kind enough to bring one of the new five liter buckets of ice cream we now have and life was good. Chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream and coffee; was man meant to have it this good? Might we not fail to pierce the veil of soulmaking if he is too caught up in experiences such as these?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our food those of us who are apt to do, set in with a bit of drinking before sojourning to the Salamander. To set the atmosphere a bit we head up to roof and lie about chatting. &lt;lj user=&quot;adrianapublico&quot;&gt; nursed a full liter of pastis and water while I worked my way through several whiskey and cream sodas. It was good that we were keeping the party fires burning because as we left to head to the club it ran a serious danger of going out. Our group of sixteen dwindled to six. People were tired, people were full, people had to get up early, blah, blah, blah&amp;hellip; Only &lt;lj user=&quot;adrianapublico&quot;&gt; and the ever faithful Scott joined us in our pursuit of dancing. Lisa came along for a bit, but left fairly shortly after flipping everyone off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sufficit to say we danced into the wee hours. The DJ did his best to prevent it by playing nothing but Spanish music. We were nothing if not persistent though and I went to the guy asking for hiphop no less than ten times. In the end I spent my time wiggling my hips and hoping for a better song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our spectacular dress continued to evolve as the night went on. The girls&apos; hadn&apos;t much to lose, so their dresses did little but darken with sweat. As for &lt;lj user=&quot;ammedley&quot;&gt; and myself though we rapidly lost our jackets and the shirt sleeves were rolled up within minutes of arriving in the club. My slide continued a bit farther and at the girls&apos; behest I was soon wearing naught save my gold vest and pants. Though they assured me it was a good look, I was dubious. I managed to reclaim my shirt and Miriam proposed that in order for me to share the shame we could simply exchange clothes. Somehow this seemed perfectly reasonable until I realized upon seeing us in the mirror in the bathroom that she in fact looked quite fetching in pants whereas I looked like a freak in a dress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunately too large to drag from the bathroom and managed to get most of my clothes back. I continued the night without my shirt looking like a wannabe Chip-n-Dale, but after the amount of humiliation I nearly suffered it was a shame easily borne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round about 3am after a surprisingly strong showing my iridescent companions decided to turn in. Much to my surprise, &lt;lj user=&quot;adrianapublico&quot;&gt; wanted to go with them. Since this left me to party alone, I decided to call it a night myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About three hours later &lt;lj user=&quot;adrianapublico&quot;&gt; and &lt;lj user=&quot;ammedley&quot;&gt; headed off to their homes and I rolled over to sleep another five hours. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>99 Problems</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been laid up with a really bad earache for the last three days. Last night it proved an interesting backdrop to a little adventure that ended with the disappearance of a pound of butter and the death of a mouse. That though is a story for later&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I&apos;ve made it out of the house and have been fighting with projects for people here at the bureau. Project #1 is take a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winamp.com&quot;&gt;winamp&lt;/a&gt; playlist and burn it onto a CD. I had a couple to do for people who are leaving, so I wrote a little script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;programation&quot;&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;DUMPCOMMAND=&quot;mplayer -ao pcm -aofile \&quot;\$wavfile\&quot; \&quot;\$file\&quot;&quot;
for file in $(cat &quot;$1&quot; | sed -e &quot;/^#/d&quot; -e &apos;s/\\/\//g&apos; -e &apos;s/^M$//&apos;); do
    [ &quot;${file:0:1}&quot; == &quot;/&quot; ] || file=&quot;${1%/*}/$file&quot;
    wavfile=&quot;${file%\.*}.wav&quot;
    wavfile=&quot;${wavfile##*/}&quot;
    [ -e &quot;$wavfile&quot; ] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;Skipped: $wavfile&quot; || eval $DUMPCOMMAND
    filelist=&quot;$filelist \&quot;$wavfile\&quot;&quot;
done
eval sudo cdrecord -dev 0,0 -eject -verbose -pad $filelist&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Project #2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project #2 was to make some updates to some websites. The problem is that my machine is at the bureau right now behind a proxy server running on NT that I can&apos;t get through. There are machines here though running special client software to proxy their traffic on all ports. Since my website updates are via &lt;a href=&quot;http://everythinglinux.org/rsync/&quot;&gt;rsync&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openssh.com&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Secure SHell&quot;&gt;ssh&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I loaded up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/&quot;&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt; which supports SSH2&apos;s tunneling mechanisms. I just made a tunnel localhost:22 &amp;rarr; himinbi.org:22 and told it to listen on the local port. Then in &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; on my laptop I put the address for my workstation as himinbi.org and all my updates worked just fine. My laptop just sent everything to my workstation which then forwarded it all over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;</event>

			<event>My lying about on my ass has left me a bit bored. I&apos;ve now listened to Tom Clancy&apos;s &lt;a style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743544692/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;War of Eagles&lt;/a&gt; as Dan Brown&apos;s &lt;a style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1402575440/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;Deception Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743538277/mentorreadingsug&quot;&gt;Angels and Demons&lt;/a&gt; on tape.

I discovered a stash of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.topcow.com/comics/31/all&quot;&gt;Witchblade&lt;/a&gt;s in French and found that I can now pretty much read conversational French. I&apos;ll not know a word here and there, but I get the gist without even having to work at it. Wanting to test my abilities I went out to a new bookstore and bought myself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menshealth.com&quot;&gt;Men&apos;s Health&lt;/a&gt; in French. It took me about twice my normal reading time to get through an article on one&apos;s bad habits (&lt;i&gt;défaults&lt;/i&gt;) and whether to reveal them (&lt;i&gt;avouer ou cacher&lt;/i&gt;). (At first read, I took it to be asking swallow or spit (&lt;i&gt;avaler oú cracher&lt;/i&gt;). I said I can read, not read well. &amp;#x263A;) An interesting verb I am waiting to put to use out of my reading is &lt;i&gt;se cuiter&lt;/i&gt; which my dictionary defines as &quot;to get smashed.&quot;</event>

				<body>hurrah!  sci fi and fantasy is definitely one of the easiest places to start if you&apos;re wanting to improve your reading speed... if you see anything by bernard weber (&lt;i&gt;les fourmis&lt;/i&gt; was his most popular back in the day), his stuff&apos;s usually kinda fun and among the least outlandish of french sci fi.  (i wish i could remember the title or author of one i got from the library once that involved a future where everyone had to stay drunk all the time to avoid a retrovirus and time-travelling back to save led zeppelin... that one was completely insane!) 

(do they sell cosmo there?  prob&apos;ly not?  i realize you&apos;re not exactly the target audience, but we used to get a big kick out of comparing the french, british, and american editions in a given month.  british is definitely the most entertaining.)  </body>

				<body>I am just amazed that I can read at all. I feel like I spend all my time with Americans and speaking English. To discover that my French has somehow magically improved makes me happy. &amp;#x263A; I&apos;m gonna go see if they&apos;ve got anything by Weber here. With Ramadan going on I&apos;ve got lots of free time on my hands. If I get a book in French, I can spend much of that time asleep.

If you remember the drunk all the time one with the retrovirus, let me know. Sounds like an interesting read.</body>

				<body>Hello,
Thank you for the reply to one of my random posts a long while ago. Though I have not responded till now, I have often thought of your advice, and quotes. I&apos;m a senior and I&apos;ve found lately I cannot sleep b/c I just lay awake thinking about what I&apos;m going to do next year. I&apos;ve found numerous late-night distractions to help quell my anxiety. Anyway, I&apos;m currently thinking of working through Teach for America. The more I think about it, the more it seems like education and education reform can really get to the root of many of today&apos;s problems. Also, though I want to travel, study, and research in South America- there is so much to be done in my own country. Though I&apos;m hoping to run away down south again soon. I&apos;m taking it you found my post through Suzanne&apos;s (my cousin) web of friends- how long are you in Mauritania? What do you think of the Peace Corps?  I&apos;m considering that as well...</body>

				<body>&lt;p&gt;Hey, sorry about being slow, for some reason my mail service dislikes the messages livejournal sends me to let me know someone commented and they get consigned to a void somewhere. Not even into the spam box; just gone. So I only know if anyone&apos;s said anything if I wander back over old stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for where to head, I&apos;d recommend getting out. I&apos;d personally not traveled very much and living in the third world for an extended period has been so amazing; both from the cultural perspective and also for helping me to have a better sense of myself. Things that will be really important to me for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for education, I really don&apos;t know. I&apos;m currently doing a bit of a jaded funk thing. I&apos;m not sure what exactly the world needs. I think that education could be invaluable, but only if people are willing to be affected. You ever read anything by Kohlberg? He&apos;s not inspirational or anything, just a psychologist. He writes about how a person&apos;s ideas and values mature (or can mature at least) over time. There were a group of teachers and psychologists who tried to develop a set of programs to help students develop to level five (social contract) or six (universal moral principles) by the time they finished highschool. It is theoretically doable, but they found that the vast majority of students did not progress. So they cut it back and tried for four (social contract) and still had a hard time. In the end they found they could improve individuals&apos; critical thinking skills and there was a little bit of a moral improvement, but by and large most people were unwilling to leave the level where the majority of Americans hang out: level three (interpersonal conformity). In the end people mostly just seem to want to do what is easy and what everyone else is doing. There is also a certain inherent xenophobia since, as moral values are defined in terms of social mores, other cultures are often not only different but barbaric. Having talked to people back home about what it&apos;s like eating with my hands, wearing a turban and fasting for Ramadan; there is a certain sense not only of it being exotic but also inferior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh, sorry. I&apos;ll stop going on. &amp;#x263A; Honestly the whole system of how the world works and where it is headed fascinates me. I tend to talk about it a bit too much given the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I say say for right now hunt for what you&apos;re passionate about. Don&apos;t go into teaching unless teaching is something you love. It is certainly an important part of making the world a better place, but wherever your heart lies you can find a way to do good. (Save that you&apos;re really into axe murder or developing biological weapons.) More than likely you&apos;ve got quite a bit of life left to live and though I think you can gain a lot from seeking to good it isn&apos;t something to sustain a sense of purpose for thirty years. If you were in a war zone or if there was a plague going on, perhaps there would be only one thing you could devote yourself to in good conscience. You&apos;ve got options though. The world is big and full of problems. I say pick some that you think you can stay with for a while and be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I&apos;m being preachy. That&apos;s never fun. I&apos;ll close with two more quotes on the subject of life direction and whatnot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Memento mori&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About $100 for each. The 5gb versus 1gb would be nice, but I love the idea of being able to throw the thing at the wall.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>Given my travel adventures the possibility of destruction is decided. Five gigs though. I remember reading an article in PC World back in high school which went on and on about how amazing it was that prices were dropping below $1 per megabyte. This is just stupefying.

				<body>I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve even seen that thing on the left before, but 5 gigs is good. That&apos;s 1 dvd, and that seems pretty useful.

On the other hand you might drop it sooo....

In any case check out techbargains.com and ableshopper.com
They find some good deals, even if there is a bit of overlap between the 2.</body>

			<subject>Teachin&apos;</subject>
			<event>More English teaching today. It was a bit of a mess. They asked if I&apos;d do a beginners class and I agreed even though I didn&apos;t have anything prepared. I figured I&apos;d teach them the alphabet and how to count or something.

I get into the class and find ten people of markedly different levels. After figuring out I was in trouble I tried to tread water a bit by going around and asking everyone questions. One girl had a hard time with &quot;where do you live?&quot; whereas another properly fielded, &quot;do you think that the recent exploitation of oil will be good for Mauritania&apos;s economy?&quot; Teaching a class for these people is just not possible.

So, I did a review of irregular past conjugations. I was, he slept, we ran, etc. I was telling them that this was the past participle. Then someone piped up and corrected me saying that for most verbs it was, like &quot;looked,&quot; but the past participle is what is used in the past continuous, not the simple past. Not &quot;I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; tired,&quot; but &quot;I have &lt;i&gt;been&lt;/i&gt; tired.&quot; Dammit.

They asked me if I&apos;d do my old class and level one tomorrow. I said yes, but I&apos;m going to back out of doing it regularly. Four hours of work in one day? That&apos;s crazy talk. I think two is a nice round number. They&apos;ll be happy either way, me being free labor and all.</event>

			<subject>Mices to Pieces</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;A transcript of my text messages from the other night:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%;&quot;&gt;Caught Molly&apos;s mouse on accident. Opened up the liquor cabinet and it jumped in the glue. After some trouble I freed it. It was kinda freakin&apos; out and I couldn&apos;t figure out what to do. I went and made him some popcorn, but he was having none of that. &lt;i&gt;My hands are numb&amp;hellip;&lt;/i&gt; I wanted to be a good host and calm him, so then I lit up a joint and blew smoke on him. This he found disquieting and it didn&apos;t seem to be working. Jus&apos; a sec. No more room&amp;hellip;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%;&quot;&gt;So I built a little paper house for him. It was surprisingly difficult. I then lit a second and smoked the little motherfucker out. He seems considerably more docile now and open to the suggestion of popcorn. I myself am now blazed. Also more susceptible to the thought of popcorn. It took 15 min to write this damned message. I gotta go check on him and figure out a creative way to end his little life. He&apos;s all covered in glue. Can&apos;t go on living like that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a brief interlude here that involves me leaving the house and going to get something to eat. I got a little nostalgic because this was the first time I&apos;ve ever been high and out in town without Marc and Lewis. Ils me manquent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Moroccan place where I had a sandwich had a special selection of Ramadan pastries out. I ended up buying about a half pound of them, or trying to at least. The guy insisted of counting up by 60&apos;s the prices of everything. 360, 420, 480, 540&amp;hellip; I tried a couple of times to convince him to use multiplication, but he wouldn&apos;t and we kept ending up with different numbers. After about ten minutes of arguing he said, &quot;fine, whatever, just pay me.&quot; It was then that I discovered I didn&apos;t have enough money. He turned slightly green, took my money and told me to just leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case I was soon back at Molly&apos;s place with food and recommenced texting&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%;&quot;&gt;I brought back crepes to eat. Crepes with butter and sugar&amp;hellip; yum. Oh Jesus! I just came in my pants that was so good. Mouse is still stuck to table. Not interested in crepe. Suffocating is painless and calm, right? Hmm. You think a Quaker Oats can is airtight enough to smother in? Ooh! Found Nesquik! Nesquik, butter and sugar crepe. Mother of God! Not again! Damn my lack of control over my manhood. Why can&apos;t I keep it from spewing my man juices all about?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%;&quot;&gt;Need to kill this mouse. I think we&apos;re rapidly approaching chew our own legs off time. Maybe mothballs with alcohol on them like for butterflies&amp;hellip; Oh! He seems to be slowing. He also seems to have a vital portion of his innards hanging out his asshole. I will seal his water glass with a candle! This feels creepy, like a Poe story. Watching the wax drip to seal the holes with the body still twitching in its glassy grave. Maybe I&apos;ll leave him as a macabre surprise for Molly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott then replied asking just how high I was, and my reply was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%;&quot;&gt;Starting to come down a bit. My jaw is messed up because of my ear infection and it hurts to chew. I&apos;ve been eating pretty steadily the last half hour. The pain was just a sort of itching sensation. It is starting to be pain again. This sucks as I am still hungry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was definitely sold on medical marijuana that night. I had a really bad ear infection. When when medical officer looked in my ear her only statement was, &quot;oh God, that&apos;s gross,&quot; and to give me some drugs. In addition to being deaf on one side, I couldn&apos;t open my jaw because all the muscles on that side were inflamed. The pain which ranged between a dull ache and occasionally sharp stabbing had pretty much killed my hunger. In the previous two days I&apos;d subsequently not eaten more that three bowls of rice and milk. I doubled my food intake in that half hour. The combination of hunger and pain relief was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted I woke up during the night in excruciating pain when all that movement caught up with me. I also found that there was about a quarter tin of Nesquik missing along with a 250g (&amp;#xBD;lb) packet of butter. Eh, what&apos;cha gonna do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I got rid of the mouse. I figured by the time Molly got back he&apos;d have transitioned from quirkily interesting to decayedly disgusting. I did however get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://will.mr.pcvs.org/mouse_prison.mov&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; of his tomb with my recently repaired shitty camera.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>I taught two classes today. It sucked. I have a book of teaching exercises and we started out with parts of the body. Then I had them give me verbs and adjectives for different parts. My favorite was &quot;big&quot; and &quot;little&quot; for butt. &quot;Aminetou has a big butt.&quot; I managed to get rid of the guy who was answering all of my questions. He&apos;s now a happy member of level two. I did that for two hours, took an hour break and then came back and did conversation class for an hour.

I really like the teaching and yet again I feel like this is something I would enjoy doing with my life. Not English, which I&apos;m finding I have a tenuous grasp on, but just standing up from of the class makes me feel good. I get to notice who is understand and who is not. I coax the quiet ones to speak and chastise the noisy ones to let others respond. Having a smaller class (12ish people) makes it possible to really have a feel for the group and I enjoy it.

In the conversation class one guy corrected my pronunciation of eighty which I pronounced &quot;eighdie&quot; rather than &quot;eightie.&quot; He said I should be more correct in my pronunciation. I told him I was already altering my natural accent significantly and proceeded to drawl out a paragraph from our selection as an example. I told him to just talk like I was and people would understand him no problem. &amp;#x263A;

It felt good to be teaching, but it was a little too much like a real job for me. The place where I&apos;m working charges the students to take class. I like that because students who show up without paying anything are generally pretty unmotivated. Money gets them coming regularly and paying attention. At the same time, I don&apos;t feel like putting someone out of a paying position with my free labor. It is probably best though since there&apos;s a Sierra Leonian guy there who I was talking to after class who hasn&apos;t been paid in over a month (he is supposed to be paid weekly).</event>

			<subject>Sidi&apos;s Rap</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;About a week ago I went to a concert for &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.earthlink.net/~malouma/&quot;&gt;Malouma&lt;/a&gt; (from Mauritania) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=music-artist&amp;field-artist=Alama%2C%20Ragheb&quot;&gt;Ragheb Allama&lt;/a&gt; (from Lebanon). The concert was pretty good. I didn&apos;t understand a word of it, but I liked Allama a bit more than Malouma. The Arabic music is just a bit more melodic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was there I chatted with a few different people. One of them was a Cameroonian who told me about how he converted to Christianity and his father disowned him and then he moved here and his father died while he was here. But, &quot;ç&apos;est ls vie,&quot; he said. He then went on a little mini-tirade about the demon of Islam being poured down children&apos;s throats when they are little and they can never be rid of it. It sounded pretty similar to stuff I&apos;ve heard before in the States except I was hearing people bemoaning unexamined Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat for a while and talked music with a couple Mauritanians working security and they told me they didn&apos;t like the Maure music. They liked rap. American rap was good, especially Busta Rhymes and Tupac. There are also some good local rappers though, both Hassaniya and Wolof. I&apos;m going to head over to one of their houses tomorrow to listen to some stuff. I wanted to take a little present and have been putting together a rap CD out of my music collection for the last hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Bon Rap&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Here&apos;s what I ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;

			<event>I was hanging out with Miriam last night discovering that she literally is incapable of smoking. She can draw into her mouth, but the inhaling she just can&apos;t manage. She mentioned that it burned which, given that she has never done anything but puff before, sounds about right.

Anyhow, as we were chatting and discussing relationships I remembered an entertaining anecdote. It comes from a form of French slang called &quot;&lt;i&gt;verlan&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; It is sort of like pig latin. You take the word and switch the order of the syllables. The word &lt;i&gt;verlan&lt;/i&gt; itself comes from the French word for reverse: &quot;&lt;i&gt;l&apos;envers&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; That&apos;s &lt;i&gt;l&apos;en&lt;/i&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;i&gt;vers&lt;/i&gt;, switch those around and you&apos;ve got &lt;i&gt;vers&lt;/i&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;i&gt;l&apos;en&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;verslen&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;verslan&lt;/i&gt;.

So, I was talking French with a fellow and we were discussing girls. I called his girlfriend at the time his &lt;i&gt;meuf&lt;/i&gt;. (&quot;&lt;i&gt;Meuf&lt;/i&gt;&quot; is &quot;&lt;i&gt;femme&lt;/i&gt;&quot; or &quot;woman&quot; in verlan.) &quot;Oh no,&quot; he said, &quot;she&apos;s not my &lt;i&gt;meuf&lt;/i&gt;. She&apos;s my &lt;i&gt;copine&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; When I asked him the distinction he said, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Ma copine, elle est pour l&apos;amour. Ma meuf est pour baiser, c&apos;est tout.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

(I&apos;ll leave that for y&apos;all to translate if you don&apos;t speak French. As a hint, I&apos;ve got an article with a full page spread of Colin Farrell and the quote, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Je bois, je jure et je baise.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; &lt;i&gt;Boire&lt;/i&gt; is to drink and &lt;i&gt;jurer&lt;/i&gt; is to swear, &lt;i&gt;baiser&lt;/i&gt; is the one you&apos;ve got to figure out.)</event>

				<body>I don&apos;t remember if I told this story or not, but I have an American friend here whose grandparents are French. When he was a kid he wanted to close his letter with &quot;big kisses&quot; (&lt;i&gt;grands bisous&lt;/i&gt;) and instead went with &lt;i&gt;grands baisers&lt;/i&gt;. He said that once they got through regretting his dreadful American upbringing they found it mildly entertaining.</body>

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -1em;&quot;&gt;[I write &quot;12 months&quot; on the board]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;: This year is 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;: Do you know &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;French&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Senna&lt;/b&gt;: 2005?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0; margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;: Umm, no&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point I didn&apos;t know what to do. How else could I describe a year? So I gave up and just asked another student who answered quickly and with a tone of relief at finally having ended this debacle. I&apos;m getting them better trained at keeping quiet when other students are talking. It is definitely not in their nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways though this also makes me feel good. I know that I gave more than adequate description of a year. Her not getting it was nothing that I could change. It means that all of the responsibility for my slow students doesn&apos;t rest on my shoulders. It is sort of liberating.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>Well, I finally got an &lt;acronym title=&quot;Windows eXPerience&quot;&gt;XP&lt;/acronym&gt; CD to boot. Extracting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/eltorito_extraction/&quot;&gt;boot image&lt;/a&gt; was no problem, but the filesystems produced by &lt;code&gt;mkisofs&lt;/code&gt; were no good. Well, they wouldn&apos;t boot. The same boot image used by M$oft&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://unattended.msfn.org/global/files/cdimage_gui.exe&quot;&gt;CDImage&lt;/a&gt; worked fine. Right now I&apos;ve not got the time to figure out the problem.

In any case, I managed to slipstream the first service pack and also get the Arabic and French &lt;acronym title=&quot;Multilanguage User Interface&quot;&gt;MUI&lt;/acronym&gt; included on the CD. I didn&apos;t get the account creation automated yet, but I&apos;ll get there. Petit á petit le nid est fait, n&apos;est pas?

I tried slipstreaming the Office 2003 service pack in on the software CD, but the process involves extracting the sources and takes them from 350mb to 650mb. That doesn&apos;t leave enough space for a lovely copy of Photoshop that happened into my hands recently. So, given the choice, they&apos;ll just get the Office without updates.

Because generating ISOs, downloading updates and burning test CDs all take lots of time I&apos;ve been here for the last twelve hours mostly just piddling around. I&apos;ve been badly behaved and ate a disturbing quantity of gatorade powder I found in the giveaway pile.

Much to my shame, I&apos;ve been spending the bulk of my time wandering through personal ads. There&apos;s only so much porn a fellow can look at after all. I was recently surprised to find that the romantic (albeit inept romantic, but romantic quand même) that I was in coming to the RIM isn&apos;t dead. He&apos;s just got a new jaded and horny boisterous beer guzzling flatmate. I&apos;m kinda happy to learn he&apos;s still in there somewhere. Granted, I like his new friend as well. &amp;#x263A;

In any case, I spend hours wandering and looking at people. I didn&apos;t really see anyone who piqued my interest, but as I am in Africa I don&apos;t suppose that is a serious problem.</event>

				<body>Apparently Jessica Dunsmore has a bunch of computer stuff for the GMC down here.  U got any idea when those CDs are gonna be sent?

I accidetally pressed a wrong button on that new computer, and need to reinstall the sound card driver.  oops.

It is funny watching my folks down here plug in their iPods to that computer.  2 seconds later, they reach for the iPod and get zapped!  It&apos;s like hand buzzers.</body>

If you do send up a flash drive, why don&apos;t you stick that video on it?</body>

				<body>btw, I made a highlight video clip of Stage 2005.
It is pretty sweet.

It is about 10 minutes long, and 30 mb.
I think to find a way to send it up to Nouakchott.
Don&apos;t have a CD burner down here.
Got an extra flash drive to spare?</body>

				<body>I&apos;d confidently argue that his habits have changed very very little.

Les Menus Précédents De William: 

- 1 large bowl white rice (approx. 2 cups uncooked), strawberry jam to taste.
- 1 large bowl white rice, Catalina dressing to taste.
- 1 large can Nestle hot chocolate mix (2 lb.), served dry a la carte
- 1 large can applesauce (1 gal.), a la carte
- 1 large plastic container of pretzels (1.5 gal.), a la carte
- combination platter, pretzels dipped in applesauce

This is what he ate when he was still back here in the land of milk and honey.</body>

			<subject>M est revenue</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been keeping busy with work and haven&apos;t had much time to update. This is just a quick update to get these messages written down because they&apos;re funny&amp;hellip; I know it&apos;s more than slightly indiscreet to record this stuff for the internet, but it is just too odd to let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M has been texting me again in the last few days. Asking about going out and whatnot. I&apos;ve not seen her in a couple months and I liked the idea. They&apos;ve been getting successively more suggestive which I certainly find flattering though a bit uncomfortable since our involvement would likely be a bad idea for so many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d not really thought much of it until a couple messages came in rapid succession after I&apos;d not made it out one night. There had been the offer of chocolates eaten in interesting ways that I had declined complaining of back problems and a need to discuss the boundaries of our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 2px solid ; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;2005/11/05 15&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;15&lt;/i&gt;: Good afternoon Will! I hope u r feeling better, so&amp;hellip; when do we schedule the massage &amp;amp; discussion? Would b a shame 2 let da WE go by uneventfully! 2 think that i&apos;ve spent most of it working, emailing, texting &amp;amp; calling, but nothing has actually happened! All virtual &amp;amp; imaginary r beginning 2 depress me!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, all fine and good. Put up or shut up, I&apos;m fine with that. It gives me a chance to get things sorted. Then I get another message about five minutes later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 2px solid ; padding-left: 1em; margin-right: 7%;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;2005/11/05 15&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;25&lt;/i&gt; Good afternoon Frank! Hope i&apos;m not waking u. Would b a shame 2 let da WE go by uneventfully! 2 think that i&apos;ve spent most of it working, emailing, texting &amp;amp; calling, but nothing has actually happened! I&apos;m not going to insist on meeting up, u have made it clear u see me bcuz u feel obligated. Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t bother u anymore, I will leave it up to u 2 call me, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp; when u ever want 2 see me again. Take care of yourself Frank!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahh, things become clearer. Things aren&apos;t working out with her fellow, so she&apos;s covering her bases. To save time she just went ahead and used the same message twice. Either that or this was some sort of strange jab. You never really know with M. I just sort of let it ride until later I got another message asking if I was going out. I replied that I didn&apos;t know and asked who Frank is. Turns out that he is a fellow much richer than myself but not nearly so interesting, romantic or funny. Well, there&apos;s that at least. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Feel Good Time</subject>
			<event>&lt;lj user=&quot;ammedley&quot;&gt; has posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/ammedley/11562.html&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; from our &lt;a href=&quot;43822.html&quot;&gt;shiny night&lt;/a&gt;. We so hot.

In other news I got a call this morning from a guy who said he&apos;s got a relative in my English class who told him I rock (not in so many words, it was French, so he said, &quot;&lt;i&gt;rocké&lt;/i&gt;&quot;) and he wanted to hire me for his institute. I told him I&apos;m out of here in a month, but it was nice to know that some of my students are enjoying themselves.

Oh yeah, further news, I set my &lt;acronym title=&quot;Close Of Service&quot;&gt;COS&lt;/acronym&gt; dote officially to be December 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Now I&apos;ve just got to figure out how to get home. &amp;#x263A;

And a final anecdote, I was hanging out yesterday with M&apos;Baye helping him get a new server up and running with &lt;a href=&quot;http://fedora.redhat.com&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;. He was saying how much he has been seduced (&lt;i&gt;séduit&lt;/i&gt;) by Linux. I asked him why he changed in the first place. He explained to me that nepotism is rampant among the Maures. He often feels that, as a black man, they are looking for any excuse to fire him and put a cousin in his place. When he got there they were using Windows 2000 Server. He got rid of that and started with a Linux box because no one knows how to configure one, so his job would be safe.</event>

			<subject>Bingo</subject>
			<event>Say you are playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/bingo_board/&quot;&gt;Bingo&lt;/a&gt; and you have boards &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/bingo_board/?max=99&amp;range=30&quot;&gt;going from 0-99 with a range of 30 numbers for each letter&lt;/a&gt;. (B can be 0-30, I can be 17-47, etc.) What are the chances that a given number will be on a person&apos;s board? Seems like one in six since there are five numbers in each column and the range is 30, so there&apos;s a five out of thirty chance.

How many turns will it take on average for a game to play out? For the board above, I verified it in class tonight empirically: &lt;em&gt;for fucking ever&lt;/em&gt;. After about ten minutes I started calling out ranges of numbers. &quot;B three through nine, if you have any of those cross them out.&quot;

In other news, the water is out at my new home. (I&apos;ve moved five times now in the last four months, for those unawares.) There&apos;s two toilets in the place and if you&apos;re careful you can get two flushes out of a single tankful of water. I&apos;ve now used those up. My fancy 1200um &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.calvinklein.com&quot;&gt;ckOne&lt;/a&gt; deodorant is now fighting an unpleasant battle against the effects of the Sahara on my scent. I tired rubbing it all over to increase the coverage and make it more effective, but this, if anything, made things worse.</event>

			<event>Tonight I brought in the teacher that will be replacing me. I told my students that I will probably be traveling for the next two weeks and she will be taking over. Then the director came by and thanked me for my work and complimented me on my high retention rate. He said they&apos;ve not had another class with as good of attendance.

The thing is that I really like these people. They are interested in learning and they really are making remarkable progress. &lt;a href=&quot;46141.html&quot;&gt;Senna&lt;/a&gt; tonight got &quot;shoulder,&quot; &quot;elbow,&quot; and properly chose the determiner for both number and distance. Later on she actually answered another student&apos;s question. I usually chastise them for speaking out of turn, but I was so surprised I forgot to.

Khadi and Lemine are at the point that when bicker they manage to stay in English for a couple of minutes before degenerating into French.

These people have really helped me remember why I enjoy teaching after my less than productive experiences at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cisco-academy.mr&quot;&gt;Cisco Academy&lt;/a&gt;. They all came up after class and told me they really have liked having me as a teacher. They made me promise to come back once more and play &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/bingo_board/&quot;&gt;bingo&lt;/a&gt; with them.</event>

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to fly out the 23rd, but the plane was full. I&apos;m beyond caring at this point though. I&apos;ll still be about 650 miles from home, but that&apos;s a good bit better that the 4500 I am now.&lt;/p&gt;

			<subject>Histoires de Drouges</subject>
			<event>Last night was solstice and I went over to Molly&apos;s house for some dinner and what proved to be a really interesting story time and candle lighting ceremony.

Afterward we were all lying about chatting and the subject of the most poisonous gastropod came up, as it is apt to do. A different Molly who is a marine biologist told the disturbing story of someone at her university who had been stung a conidae. The poison is extremely virulent and rendered the fellow completely paralyzed. As he lie there on the beach with people all around him assisting his breathing, he was unable to move for several hours. Unable to make any sound at all to tell them to close his eyes as he stared at the sun until it burned out his retinas. What a horrible horrible thing to have to experience.

From there the subject drifted to other drugs and I mentioned that I have an interview for a web administrator position with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mpp.org&quot;&gt;Marijuana Policy Project&lt;/a&gt; when I get back. I mentioned that really being committed to the work I am doing is something I enjoy and though I certainly think this is a valid issue, I wasn&apos;t really passionate about it. Also, I know from working on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mil-tec.com&quot;&gt;missile defense system&lt;/a&gt; what it feels like to have a job that some people disapprove of and I wasn&apos;t sure I wanted another.

It was then that the original Molly told the story of a friend of her father&apos;s who grew marijuana in his house for himself and his friends. At one point he took a homeless man in and fed him and housed him for a while. It turns out that this homeless man was wanted by the police and when they caught him he turned in his benefactor as a part of the plea bargain. The guy got seven years. Coincidentally, during his time in prison he developed a neurological disorder that both causes him to shake and occasionally quite a bit of pain. That he can&apos;t smoke at a time that it would likely help make him more comfortable is another bit of unfortunate irony.

Both the responses of my friends and this story helped me feels a little bit better about the job. More than likely my dad is going to be his usually disapproving self and accuse me of being a pot head. If that be the case, fuck&apos;im. As I&apos;ve been emailing back and forth in the last couple days setting up travel plans I&apos;ve been having long forgotten feelings of guilt and failure at not measuring up to what my parents wanted me to be. I don&apos;t hope to make those go away, but at the least I&apos;ll not let them drive me.</event>

				<body>You do realize that it will mostly be the opposite set of people who would disapprove of that job :).

Web Admin, is that more of an IT job or a programming job? Sounds like IT. But oh well. As you can tell from my LJ, jobs are one problem the man-child president has solved... there aren&apos;t any :). Especially in the South(although, I should strongly note that I have looked pretty much everywhere... and the pickings are very slim...).

Of course, the number one factor in all job hunting(even the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wallstreetprogrammer.com/2005/12/15/finding-a-programming-job-on-wall-street/&quot;&gt;Wall Street Programmer&lt;/a&gt; agrees) is simply knowing someone. Skills are irrelevant. Portfolio&apos;s are irrelevant. Its all about knowing someone on the inside. Period. Simple.

Most every other job hunting strategy involves trying to find someone on the inside to help you.

Chalk it up to cynicism, but I swear its true. Oh yeah, if what&apos;s going on right now works out, it will be because of someone on the inside(that I met in an online forum, by making a flippant remark...).

I think this is wrong, but since I&apos;m broke(and therefore not hiring) I can&apos;t really try to rectify this.</body>

			<event>In Casablanca remedying the fact that I left Mauritania without writing down a single piece of information about my flight out of JFK. Got it all now. Smooth sailing thus far. Exhausted from three days of Christmas and pre-Christmas partying, but just got a big cup of café au lait in me and doing much peppier. Gonna go see my family for ten hours before wandering off again. &amp;#x263A; Hopefully they&apos;ll indulge me and let me tell at least a few of the stories of the 100lbs of souvenirs I&apos;m bringing back.</event>

				<body>Hey, Will.  Merry Christmas and a happy new year.  Hope all is well.  April asked me to ask you to shoot her an email &apos;cause she&apos;d like to ask you a few questions about Mauritania!  Hope you are having fun back home.  Anyway, off to the football stadium to watch and ultimate frisbee match.  Peace Corps The Gambia is taking over!!!</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I only got back to Tennessee Saturday morning. Before that my schedule went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Wandering&quot;&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;border: thin solid&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;border: thin solid&quot;&gt;Trip&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;border: thin solid&quot;&gt;Period&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;border: thin solid&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2005/12/26&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nouakchott - Casablanca&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;3:00&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I went to the Christmas party at Obie&apos;s, enjoyed a fabulous meal, passed on a copious porn collection and bid farewell to Mauritania at 3am.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2005/12/26&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Casablanca - New York&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;8:00&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;After doing a little shopping with Cailin during my layover I headed back Stateside.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2005/12/26&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;New York - Cleveland&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;1:45&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I ran harried through customs in an attempt to compensate for my flight being two hours late and made in through in about 30 minutes only to find my next flight delayed for an hour.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2005/12/26&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Cleveland - Dayton&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;:30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Not understanding that a single flight could involve changing planes (and thus not expecting the stop in Cleveland), I had told my family to come late making for a bit of a wait when I arrived in Dayton on time. I had missed Christmas, but I got to do show and tell before everyone headed out the next morning.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2005/12/30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Dayton - Cleveland&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;:30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Having spent an entertaining three days hanging out with Uncle Ted and Mema, I headed out.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2005/12/30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Cleveland - Boston&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;:45&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Sat in yet another airport playing with the phone my mom lent me.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2005/12/30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Boston - New York&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;1:00&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I pulled into New York having neither a place to stay nor the slightest clue as to where anything was. I rode around on the train for a bit and finally found Valentin in Chinatown. We had some Chinese food and went to a pool hall to await the evening when Nick and Beth came in from DC and we all met up with Carl, Adrian, Caroline and Maggie. Maggie was awesome and put Marc and I up for the night after the lot of us drank a good 20 gallons of beer in a half dozen different bars.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2005/12/31&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;New York - Montpelier&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;5:30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Maggie being both brave and amazing lent Marc and I her car and we headed up to Ben&apos;s house in Vermont. The other folks we&apos;d been with had already rented a car and headed up on their own. Once there we met up with Nate, Racey, Dan, Geri, Bouli, Bintu, Danny and Megan. Kegstands and shots of Black at 5pm bode for an interesting evening. My brother Matt came out and did surprisingly well with this group of miscreants before heading back home for another party.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2006/01/01&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Montpelier - Stowe&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;:30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Matt came back down and picked me up and I went to visit chez lui. He lives in a really cool old barn. We got some chicken and ice cream and just hung out for the evening. (The sun goes down at 4:30 in Vermont.)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2006/01/02&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Stowe - Montpelier&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;:30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Matt took me around the mountain and I turned in a job application at the mountain since I really liked the place. Then we went out to this huge frozen waterfall before heading back to Ben&apos;s.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2006/01/02&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;Montpelier - New York&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;5:30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Having said goodbye to Matt; Marc, Nate and I headed back to the Big Apple. Maggie was cool as always and put us up for the evening after we&apos;d all gone out for burritos.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;2006/01/03&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;New York - Arlington&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: center&quot;&gt;4:30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Marc and I took the Chinatown bus that goes between the Chinatowns in New York and DC. The bus left at 1:30 which in Chinese means &quot;whenever its full&quot; as it was gone when we got there at 1:10. No problem though, the next bus was to arrive at 2:00 which is Chinese for 4:30. After paying as much for the cab ride to Marc&apos;s brother&apos;s house as to get to DC ($20), I crashed out in the basement.&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;I interviewed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpp.org&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Marijuana Policy Project&quot;&gt;MPP&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt; people on the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and they asked me to come by and interview the next day. Marc though was worried about trouble in the homestead, so I called up Cat and she agreed to put me up for a night.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;My extended stay with Cat and Lesley was productive: I made my interview wearing a tie I&apos;d bought 20 minutes before in Union Station on the condition that the guy behind the counter tie it for me. I went out to sushi with my cousin Cindy. I mocked Lesley when &lt;acronym title=&quot;University of Southern California&quot;&gt;USC&lt;/acronym&gt; got whooped. I was chastised by Audrey for being a poor communicator. I watched Wedding Crashers and gifted people with cookies. But it had to come to an end, so I headed to catch the 10am bus which I missed by 15 minutes, so I spent my 10 hour wait wandering the streets. Eventually I ended up in the Wythville bus station at 3am listening to people tell stories of having their children taken from them, doing coke and getting shot.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;border: thin solid; padding-left: .25em; padding-right:.25em; text-align: justify&quot;&gt;Bright and early I finally made it home and mommy, daddy and myself all headed to Shoney&apos;s for a welcome breakfast buffet.&lt;/td&gt;

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Damnation. I am burning through money. I just got through putting together my new computer&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you finish Peace Corps there are two main places you get cash. One is your readjustment allowance which you accrued at a rate of $220 a month during your service. I&apos;ve only gotten the third of it that you get in country at &lt;acronym title=&quot;Close of Service&quot;&gt;COS&lt;/acronym&gt; and that was $1800. The check was cut in expectation of my COS in September, so my two thirds ought to be a little more than $3600, maybe $4200 or so. The other money is you can get a check in lieu of the money they would have spent to fly you home. For me that was right at $2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;49658.html&quot;&gt;My post-reentrance travels&lt;/a&gt; have already burned through $600 and I gave my dad $700 for his car tonight. I just about matched that with the $1100 I just spent on my new computer. It isn&apos;t even all that fancy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;ll be nice to have a computer of my own again. I&apos;m going to have to buy a laptop relatively soon as well because I plan on putting &lt;a href=&quot;http://fedora.redhat.com&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; on this system and I&apos;ll need a system running Windows to test websites with. That&apos;ll come with time though.&lt;/p&gt;

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Well, making some progress on the money front. Just accepted the &lt;acronym title=&quot;Marijuana Policy Project&quot;&gt;MPP&lt;/acronym&gt; web administrator position. The money isn&apos;t great (40k which is less than half of what &lt;a href=&quot;http://salary.com&quot;&gt;salary.com&lt;/a&gt; says it ought to be for the web design / programming / server administration I&apos;ll be doing), but it&apos;s enough to get me to move to DC and hang out for a bit. I really liked the folks there and it sounds like it will be interesting work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also sounds like it is probably going to kick my ass for a couple months as they are way behind on a major migration to a new provider. I figure I&apos;ll give myself over to it, get it going well and things ought to die down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure if nothing else, I&apos;ll use this to move and get a feel for the city. I&apos;ll work them through the redesign and hosting transition which is the hard part, and I&apos;ll reevaluate how things stand. I&apos;d just have been sitting on my ass in any case, so I figure no great loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exciting. I&apos;m starting the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; however, so that gives me two weeks to build a life. My to-do list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;driver&apos;s license&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&amp;#x2713; car ($700 &amp;bull; &apos;98 Chrysler Concorde)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;car insurance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open bank account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&amp;#x2713; Christmas at Grandma&apos;s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&amp;#x2713; computer ($1100 &amp;bull; Sempron 2800+ / 1gb / 450gb RAID 0+1)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wardrobe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;apartment&lt;/li&gt;

				<body>Hell, I&apos;m looking at living on or near the hill and it would cost me two to three times the worth of the damned thing to park it for a year. I may well end up abandoning it if the metro proves as useful as it is rumored to be.

I just about didn&apos;t take the car even though it is a really good deal. It runs fine, but I can&apos;t look at it without thinking &quot;grandmamobile.&quot; Usually I&apos;m not one for appearances, but it has been two and a half years since I&apos;ve had a semi-normal relationship and I&apos;m finding myself uncharacteristically attached to thoughts of how the ladies are going to see things.</body>

				<body>Those numbers about what you &quot;ought&quot; to be making are a total lie. Plus, MPP is not a &quot;for profit&quot; place I imagine.

Anyway, good luck with the job. You should IM me sometime :). Also, since I&apos;m mostly in East TN right now, we should get together before you vanish off to that den of iniquity(DC, not the MPP...).</body>

				<subject>Re: Lies, Damn Lies, and Salary Statistics...</subject>
				<body>I dunno. I know they are getting a deal in part because they offered me the job within a day of interviewing me. I was in the process of getting the info ready to send to my references to send to them and they hired me without checking them. That and they started at 37.5, I said 40 and the way she said yes sounded relieved. I&apos;m kinda curious how high I could have gone.

Do you know anyone doing this sort of work for a company? What are they making? This is not just website design. This is doing all the program to bring a whole new site up and all the server administration. If this is done right they are looking to add a whole new organizational component to their efforts doing more grassroots development. A huge part of that advertising and coordinating is through this new site. To get that done right is worth 80k easy.</body>

				<body>&quot;To get that done right is worth 80k easy.&quot;

I agree with you :). Honestly, the job situation has been bleak for me until about a week ago. Right now I&apos;m in Conyers, GA interview &lt;a href=&quot;http://geckosystems.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I also have a &quot;boring&quot; IT job interview when I get back, and some people at Yahoo are passing my resume around.

Part of it is that apparently, the best time to job hunt is around the beginning of the year, so we&apos;re getting some more hits right now, but things are still up in the air. Well, I would explain more but I&apos;m not going to say much until after I get through the interviews I&apos;m in.

Businesses in general try to get by for as low as they can. I think some of my problems include having a MS, more degrees = more money, they&apos;ll go for the BS everytime... Also, for places like DC, cost of living is a big deal. $40K in most places in TN would be great, DC is different(check a cost-of-living calculator on the net), Silicon Valley is insane($20K/yr just on BAD housing...). Also, you&apos;re going to lose about 30% of that in taxes. Benefits help too, but it all depends.</body>

			<event>&lt;a href=&quot;http:\\www.paypal.com&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; really does &lt;a href=&quot;http://paypalsucks.com&quot;&gt;suck&lt;/a&gt;. When I got ready to head to Africa, I closed my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ttcu.org&quot;&gt;bank account&lt;/a&gt;. While I was there PayPal implemented an extra security measure to where I had to enter the whole number of my bank account in order to access my account. Not having brought any documentation from my now closed account to Africa with me, I was shit out of luck. I sent them some emails asking what could be done to resolve the problem, but they always asked me to call them despite my explanation that it would cost me a weeks salary to do so.

So, I left it. Yesterday I called them and explained the situation. Their response? &quot;Oh, that is unfortunate; sorry.&quot; There is nothing they will do. I asked them if they could just delete that bank account from my account so that if I was a criminal that I couldn&apos;t steal anything and they refused. They said that if I can&apos;t find a copy of that number somewhere I&apos;m just locked out.

It is a pain not only because I would like to use PayPal, but also because I think I had some money in the account. Money which I guess belongs to PayPal now since I can&apos;t get to it.

I was bitching to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doomfire.net/brett/&quot;&gt;Brett&lt;/a&gt; about it and he said that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jendo.us&quot;&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt; was having different issues. She opened an account with her school email address and school phone number and now doesn&apos;t have access to either. When she wanted to just open a new account, she can&apos;t because a bank account can only be used with one system and hers is locked into the account she can&apos;t access.

Fuckers.</event>

				<body>I had some problems with an older Paypal account. I ended up having to call them. The good news is if you get the right person, they&apos;re pretty decent. It also helped that I was wanting to totally close out all my accounts.

I won&apos;t &quot;vouch&quot; for them, but the guy was extremely helpful and understanding that I talked to, so it is possible to reason with them. Plus, they are (understandably) paranoid about fraud. Doesn&apos;t always make us happy, but a &quot;conservative&quot; approach is probably more secure(not always, also, for this purpose &quot;neo-con&quot; != &quot;conservative&quot;...).

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been having a hell of a time finding a place to live in DC. I&apos;ve been on &lt;a href=&quot;http://washingtondc.craigslist.org&quot;&gt;craigslist&lt;/a&gt; just about every day, to little avail. I&apos;ve been sending out messages, but getting few responses and it is kinda freaking me out. I don&apos;t want to walk into work next Monday and not be able to really focus on it because I am still worrying about finding a house. At the same time this is a decision that is likely going to affect me for the next year at least, so I&apos;d like to not make it hastily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a really good lead from &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.erols.com/rbrwak/&quot;&gt;Wakana&lt;/a&gt;. She was telling me about places and sounded interested until she asked where I was going to be working. After I told her the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mpp.org&quot;&gt;MPP&lt;/a&gt;, communications stopped. Last night I sent her another message reiterating my interest and expressing concern that the nature of my employ was giving her cause for reservation. I tried to assure her and sent her links to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://resume.himinbi.org&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://will.mr.pcvs.org/description_of_service.html&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Description of Service&quot;&gt;DOS&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since how exactly does one prove they&apos;re not a miscreant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I got a reply. Two lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thank you for your interest in our house.&lt;br /&gt;
As of now the housing offer is withdrawn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suck.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<subject>congratulations on the job</subject>
				<body>Will,

Congratulations on the job with the MPP.  Good luck finding a job in DC.  I don&apos;t think that I have any contacts in DC currently... (or none that I know very well... that I know of).  How about the MCC house (located somewhere near the green-line, north of Du-pont).  Post on Leah&apos;s blog if you want help... she has friends in DC... leah_travels
I am also looking for a house here in Kiffa, but unfortunately we don&apos;t have &quot;craigslist&quot; here... so its kind of difficult, I just wander the streets from house to house asking if anyone knows of an empty house that I can rent--I&apos;m not sure that this tactic will work in DC, keep trying the online listings.

good luck.
peace, Andrew</body>

				<body>all the locals i met at the DC exchange i went to recently lived pretty far out... columbia, arlington, those sorts of places.  and told stories of co-workers who were much, much further.  not sure how much was affordability, how much was where they worked, etc.  the car-load of folks i rode up ended up staying in four different towns, making time to load up and leave a little interesting.  

so anyway.  i guess i don&apos;t really know anyone who&apos;d be much help looking for housing in central d.c.  but best of luck with it.  that&apos;s a crazy situation to get thrown into, so i&apos;m sure your new co-workers will understand if you seem a wee bit overwhelmed for a few days.  and big congrats on the job!</body>

			<event>&lt;a href=&quot;http://dragons-keep.net&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; came over tonight and we watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/&quot;&gt;Lord of War&lt;/a&gt;. I liked the film though I was a little disturbed at my response to it: I didn&apos;t care. I see people being chopped apart with machetes and though I do feel a sense of loss and pain it is dwarfed almost immediately. It is like the moment is frozen and things zoom out to the millions of lives that the planet is teeming with: happinesses, pains, loves and hatreds. Whatever the moment, it is being done a thousand times over. Whatever the suffering or pleasure it is nothing original; nothing unique. Beyond that the world freezes and the gulf of time swallows everything. It is the same sense of smallness, but orders of magnitude larger.

I see Nicholas Cage&apos;s brother sacrifice his life to try and save a random village, and I respect his sacrifice. I see Nicholas Cage turn around and finish his deal. My response to both is the same: it just doesn&apos;t matter. If the Earth is snuffed out tomorrow, it won&apos;t make so much as a footnote in the history of the universe.

The film actually touches on the whole finding purpose and meaning in the face of meaninglessness idea. I&apos;ve read Camus and Frankl and I understand the issue philosophically. That, of course, means relatively little so far as the heart is concerned.</event>

			<event>You know the game where you spin around in circles while holding your head on a baseball bat? At one time there was a government program where they trained an orangutan to play that game. It was a highly secret program and there are few records of it, but one can see clear evidence of it in that only staggering simian could have laid out the infernal rats&apos; nest that is the road system in DC. That or they taped a pen to a hamster and shot it up with massive quantities of meth.

I made it up from Tennessee in about seven hours even with my stop for an oil change, but then spent an hour wandering in circles trying to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://restaurants.washingtoncitypaper.com/restaurant.php?rID=1745http://restaurants.washingtoncitypaper.com/restaurant.php?rID=1745&quot;&gt;Haydee&apos;s&lt;/a&gt;. Once Happy Hour was over I gave up on trying to find the place and decided just to head to Cat&apos;s.

On the cover of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/&quot;&gt;Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide&lt;/a&gt; it says, &quot;Don&apos;t Panic.&quot; Critical advice for any traveler. I managed to spend another hour and forty-five minutes wandering around trying to find Cat&apos;s. After much beeping, many forced on ramps and the closest I&apos;ve come to tears in quite a while; I managed to make it. Tomorrow I brave the city again. I&apos;m considering just renting a hotel room out here so I don&apos;t have to face that damned mess again.</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I got a lovely email from me daddy asking all sorts of questions. I suppose it is all good stuff for people to know, so I&apos;ll just post it here since I&apos;ve got lots of workin&apos; to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly appreciate the interest, but have little to report as of yet. I&apos;ll fill in the blanks I can&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: .8em;&quot;&gt;Have you found housing accommodations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a roof and a bed. I&apos;m staying with a guy named Thomas for $300 a week. A little pricey, but he&apos;s got a nice place and I felt like I was imposing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22cindy+kittner%22&quot;&gt;Cindy&lt;/a&gt; who has a beautiful, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/DC-Washington-Quebec-House.html&quot;&gt;cozy apartment&lt;/a&gt;. Thomas got the place with his partner, but they had a falling out apparently, leaving him with extra space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: .8em;&quot;&gt;Is your place of employment meeting your expectations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mpp.org&quot;&gt;marijuana people&lt;/a&gt; work really hard. Honestly they work harder than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mil-tec.com&quot;&gt;missile people&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve been going pretty much full speed both days I&apos;ve been here. I want nothing more right now then to head home and curl up for a nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: .8em;&quot;&gt;Do you have access to a means of verbal communication?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, because until my credit card comes in from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbandt.com&quot;&gt;BB&amp;T&lt;/a&gt; I have no way to buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inphonic.com/sOnePager.asp?zipcode=22202&amp;carrierid=60&amp;phoneid=23450&amp;planid=14358&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. It is $250 with a $150 rebate and I don&apos;t want to put that on mom&apos;s card. Hopefully that card will be in within a couple days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: .8em;&quot;&gt;Is the automobile proving to be satisfactory transportation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninja Grandma is running fine. I&apos;ve not been taking her out much since this city&apos;s road system was designed by a deranged hamster on smack, but she&apos;s running well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: .8em;&quot;&gt;Are you enjoying good health?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still can&apos;t walk, but that&apos;s normal. I&apos;m gonna go to the doctor about the tuberculosis thing relatively soon. Other than that and the eight pounds I&apos;ve put on in the last week and a half, my pudgy widdwle cheeks are rosy and bright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: .8em;&quot;&gt;Are you eating properly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work above a subway. I&apos;ve eaten five subs in six days. To the extent that is healthy, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: .8em;&quot;&gt;Are you still availing yourself upon the good will of your cousin from Louisville?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, no. She did take me out this Friday though and introduce me to some of her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalgeographic.com&quot;&gt;National Geographic&lt;/a&gt; friends and the DC nightlife. We went to a place called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&amp;id=1097887&quot;&gt;Wonderland&lt;/a&gt; which offered two specialty drinks: &quot;the blue pill&quot; promising to ease your cares and leave you waking up remembering nothing, and &quot;the red pill&quot; promising truth and the likely wish that you&apos;d taken the blue pill. I myself had a red pill and either a cat took a poop in my mouth during the night or the drink delivered as promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of fun though. I was seriously impressed at the abandon and vigor with which Cindy attacked the evening. We ended up back at her place with me passing out to the smell of frying bacon. Bacon that I found incinerated on the stove the next morning. Drunken bacon
cooking not working out so well apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: .8em;&quot;&gt;and finally, did Little Bo Peep ever find those sheep?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did not though I hear tales that she has started a chinchilla ranch and is making more off of their highly valued little hides than
those irritating sheep ever provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;br /&gt;
Will&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I know that I&apos;ve been remiss in not updating more regularly. I am a horrible horrible person in general so far as my communications. None of my friends should ever forgive my complete and total insensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, enough guilt&amp;hellip; My move to the big city has been going well. I&apos;ll start at the bottom of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&apos;s_hierarchy_of_needs&quot;&gt;Maslow&apos;s hierarchy&lt;/a&gt; and work my way up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;pad-left: .75em; text-indent: -.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food:&lt;/strong&gt; Work is going alright. I am staying pretty busy and everyone is friendly to the extent that anyone really talks in the office. I just got a program done to migrate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpp.org/releases.html&quot;&gt;press releases&lt;/a&gt; migrated over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpptest.kintera.org&quot;&gt;new site&lt;/a&gt;. There are over 400 of them from the last ten years, so automating that process got me some kudos since it would have taken a temp a couple weeks. It also involved reverse engineering much of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kintera.com&quot;&gt;Kintera&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s interface, so other sections should go up quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;pad-left: .75em; text-indent: -.5em; margin-bottom: .5em&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;shelter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelter:&lt;/strong&gt; I have a house now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;pad-left: .75em; margin-top: .5em; margin-bottom: .5em&quot;&gt;I like the people that I&apos;m living with. They&apos;re quirky, but I can hardly be one to fault someone for that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arin:&lt;/em&gt; No fucking clue about this guy. I&apos;ve literally never seen him. Not so much the social butterfly this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;pad-left: .75em; margin-top: .5em; margin-bottom: .5em&quot;&gt;I like the people, but the one thing that really bugs me is the lack of a commons room. The room that it ought to be is Arin&apos;s hideaway. I&apos;m just too sociable not to have people over to hang out. What is absolutely great? &lt;a href=&quot;http://local.google.com/local?saddr=213+f+st+ne+20002&amp;daddr=236+massachusetts+ave+ne+20002&quot;&gt;My commute.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;pad-left: .75em; text-indent: -.5em; margin-bottom: .5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; I&apos;ve been keeping a pretty full social calendar. I&apos;ve had stuff to do most every Friday and Saturday and a couple nights during the week. Some places I can remember going to: Wonderland, Saint-X, The Black Cat, Angles, Cocopooli&apos;s, Intodebleu, BowlAmerica, The Big Hunt, Mackey&apos;s, Bailey&apos;s, Asahi Kaiten, The Brickskeller, Spice, Bread and Chocolate, Bedazzled, Second Story, The Union Pub, Kelly&apos;s Pub&amp;hellip; That&apos;s all I remember. Some nights are a little fuzzy to be honest. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;pad-left: .75em; margin-top: .5em;&quot;&gt;The one big problem is money. I have been spending about $60-$80 a night on the weekends and I just can&apos;t afford to do that on a regular basis. I just get really sociable and start buying drinks and that gets expensive fast. I&apos;m wanting to start being a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcpvalentin.smugmug.com/gallery/250464#comment&quot;&gt;ghetto&lt;/a&gt; and getting liquored up a bit peremptorily, but see &lt;a href=&quot;#shelter&quot;&gt;shelter&lt;/a&gt; as to issues surrounding that. I just got some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/tech-data/B0002SQ0AE/ref=dp_nav_0/002-0412896-1482462?n=172282&quot;&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe I&apos;ll just start having a preparty in my room. I&apos;m sure the roomies would love that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;pad-left: .75em; text-indent: -.5em; margin-bottom: .5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love:&lt;/strong&gt; I&apos;ve met a couple cool girls since I&apos;ve been here. I&apos;ve found that I am significantly more skilled at befriending than seducing. I also realized that I&apos;ve not asked a girl out in almost seven years. My already diminutive quantity of game has apparently atrophied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;pad-left: .75em; margin-top: .5em;&quot;&gt;I did have an entertaining afternoon seeing the sights and eating chocolate with an enticing young lady this weekend. I&apos;ve asked her if she&apos;ll accompany me for more fondue next weekend to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meltingpot.com&quot;&gt;Melting Pot&lt;/a&gt; when I take &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/3and.net/&quot;&gt;Wayne&lt;/a&gt; out. I reckon I&apos;ll know about that in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;pad-left: .75em; text-indent: -.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Actualization:&lt;/strong&gt; Eh.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Dating</subject>
			<event>Here&apos;s a dating question that came up in talking to my roommates tonight. I don&apos;t reckon it&apos;ll ever matter, but I&apos;m curious about people&apos;s opinions.

What are the rules and mores regarding dating multiple people simultaneously? I figured there was an initial period where you&apos;re just dating and then at some point you either get a sense or explicitly discuss your exclusivity. One of my roommates think that there is a lot of variety on the issue and that I&apos;m obligated to discuss the issue with a girl. To me that just seems way too serious for people that are just getting to know each other.

What do y&apos;all think?</event>

				<subject>Definitely some fudge factor...</subject>
				<body>I think its &quot;okay&quot; depending on your definition of date. Of course, my variety of experiences here limits me, but, relationships evolve in different ways. Certainly, I have had relationships that were... odd... due to my experiences in ballroom dancing.

Of course, for me, the ultimate answer is transparency. Keep the honesty immediate and at the forefront, and everything resolves itself.

YMMV... this may explain why I got my first real relationship at age 23...

				<subject>Re: Definitely some fudge factor...</subject>
				<body>My definition of dating is going out and eating and dancing and whatnot, but not having sex yet. Sometime around the sex bit, talks need to be had and things need to get sorted out. I think that&apos;s a good idea physically as well as emotionally.

As for transparency, I don&apos;t really agree. If I ask a girl out on Friday and she says she&apos;s busy, but doesn&apos;t offer an explanation, I&apos;m not going to push the issue. If we&apos;ve only been out a couple times I don&apos;t see as I have any claim on her time and if she&apos;s got a date with someone else, I&apos;d just as soon not know that. I assume that the majority of girls are operating in the same way. Wen I get to a point that I feel like things are getting serious and I would exclusivity, then we can talk about it. 

My roommates position was that if she really liked a guy and found out that he was also seeing someone else it would really hurt her. I can see that I would be in the same place, but I also just consider that part of the whole dating process. I get to know people, I connect with them and, is often the case, with that comes the risk of getting hurt.

Again, that this will ever be an issue I doubt. I just was surprised at my roommates adamance on the issue.</body>

				<subject>Re: Definitely some fudge factor...</subject>
				<body>As to transparency, I wasn&apos;t suggesting to &quot;push&quot; other people, but rather that if you&apos;re transparent about your intentions, that it would keep things pretty even.

Again, I never had a girlfriend until I was 23, and that&apos;s currently who I&apos;m still dating(at 26...), so between the two of us, we know who the Don Juan is...

Of course, since I won&apos;t have premarital sex, that also presents other issues as to &quot;where&quot; to draw the line at. I guess the reason why I think it might be &quot;okay&quot; is in the early stages of the &quot;relationship&quot; where people aren&apos;t sure about what the status of the relationship is. For instance, the stuff you define as dating is stuff where things may be ambiguous, since it may not be clear.

Ah well, it doesn&apos;t matter much to me at this point, just figured I would share my thoughts on it :).</body>

				<subject>Re: Definitely some fudge factor...</subject>
				<body>It is kinda hard though to be transparent without establishing preferences and essentially pushing.

It is just a hard subject to discuss because it bears on two different issues. If we talk and I say I like being non-exclusive, that is to say, &quot;I like you, but I want to keep my options open.&quot; (Which most people find less than conducive to the trust that is an integral part of a budding relationship.) If we talk and I say I want exclusivity, that is a semi-serious commitment in most people&apos;s books and if they are uncertain about the relationship it could be grounds for ending it.

I think it is an important issue and one that bears discussion, but honestly only when you are serious about someone and are ready to be exclusive. There&apos;s never a good reason that I know of to tell someone, &quot;you&apos;re cool and all, but I&apos;m just not sure that I can&apos;t do better.&quot;

P.S. The world is which I am Don Juan is a sad one indeed.</body>

				<body>I think this boils down to what you called in another post &quot;game&quot;.

Re: P.S. Well, my &quot;relationship preferences&quot; put me pretty far out of mainline culture, so its hard for me to really be able compare. Even within &quot;Christian culture&quot; in the US, taking a hardline about premarital sex puts me in a minority.</body>

				<subject>as a not necessarily &quot;normal&quot; girl</subject>
				<body>It would bother me to know if the guy that I was dating was dating multiple other girls.  Of course I don&apos;t really consider it dating until there&apos;s a more intimate physical relationship (making out and further).  Up until that point, we&apos;re just hanging out and I&apos;m happy to date whoever I want.

Of course on the practical end of things.  If you&apos;re looking for a serious relationship and not just a f*ck buddy then finding the energy for one person can be a stretch much less two or more.  =)  So it would be a hypothetical.</body>

				<body>The way I would plan to do this would depend on what I thought I wanted.

Note that what I would plan to do and what I would do may be two different things. Also what I want and what I think I want are often two different things.

If I wanted an exclusive relationship, I&apos;d be focused on the search instead of the sex. And so I wouldn&apos;t be having sex with anyone until we&apos;d agreed to be exclusive and had had the talk about sexual history/needle use since the last incurable-STD test results came back. Of course, I wouldn&apos;t bother agree to be exclusive with someone unless I knew how compatible we were (how happy I&apos;d be with her, how happy she&apos;d be with me).

If I didn&apos;t want an exclusive relationship, but was looking for physical intimacy, I&apos;d be upfront in some way, probably after the clothes started flying (&quot;Hey, you know I&apos;m not looking for a commitment, right?&quot;). But I expect I&apos;d have a sense that she wasn&apos;t looking for a commitment by that point in the evening.

And for all the (ex)girlfriends reading this, I&apos;m not claiming that this is in any way a reflection of what I&apos;ve done in the past. I always ended up wanting an exclusive relationship, regardless of what I thought I wanted.</body>

				<subject>re: wants</subject>
				<body>Where I&apos;m at right now is that most of what I want is someone to do stuff with. Go to restaurants and dancing and the umpteen million other things that DC has to offer. If the doing of things was punctuated by the occasional having of sex, that would be damn near perfect.

Were I to meet someone and get blown away and just be all gushy in love, that would be great. The issue at hand is that the frequency with which  I meet a girl and know from being around her that I really would like to date her for a while is about once a year. Girls that I meet and I like them, but I&apos;m not immediately swept off my feet are, not surprisingly, much more common.

Part of this question for me is about the morality of having casual relationships. Not a fuck buddy because I like these girls and care about them and like going on real dates, but I&apos;m simply not just completely blown away.</body>

				<subject>Re: wants</subject>
				<body>Then I&apos;d say that as long as they know you&apos;re not looking for a longterm relationship, you&apos;re fine.

And yes, you should phrase it that way, because if you tell them you are looking for a longterm relationship, they&apos;re just not it -- well, that&apos;s trouble. Even I know that. Of course, if you end up falling in love with the person, and they&apos;re still not looking for an exclusive relationship, that sucks for you. Which is why it&apos;s safest not to have sex with them, because then you can end up falling in love with someone with whom you&apos;re not really compatible. Damn hormones.</body>

				<body>Perhaps you could answer an email or two while you&apos;re at it :).

I mean, I think it was easier(not much...) to hold a conversation with you while you were in Africa.

Of course, I realize I&apos;m not exactly the king of following up either, but still... :).

			<event>Well, it looks as though I may soon be homeless once again. As I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivankara.livejournal.com/52083.html&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, I have a place to live right now. The place is a little expensive for the space and the roommates a little more sedate than myself, but they&apos;re entertaining and it is two blocks from work.

So, I was planning on spending a couple months here and then reevaluating before moving on. It looks as though there might be a bit of an issue with that as the house is currently unraveling.

It began initially with an overflowed toilet on the first floor. The house, like many in DC, is old and the pipes are small. There was a clog and this caused large quantities of filthy water to come spilling out of the downstairs toilet when someone took a shower upstairs. This didn&apos;t really bug me, as such things are bound to happen from time to time and the landlord had a plumber in within a day to get everything snaked out. It freaked my roommates out a bit though who haven&apos;t had their poop aversion worn away by a couple years in Africa. &amp;#x263A;

Thus it was into an already tense situation that the revelation that the previous tenant of my room was a dipshit came to light. The house responsibilities are divided into people cleaning various and sundry things except for the occupant of my room who did the bills. Now that he is gone the bills are coming due and the discovery has been made that he was fucking around with the numbers and only paying the late fees. Thereby he reduced the cost each month, but it means that essentially no bills have been paid for several months. All the money that people have been paying has been going to the late fees and had no effect on the actual balance leaving an outstanding balance of over $1300 and the gas to soon be disconnected.

I would so want to beat someone&apos;s ass if I discovered that they&apos;d been essentially throwing my money away every month.

The ideal solution to this situation is to go over what the bills, disregarding late fees, were for the last few months and then take the dipshit to court for all the money he wasted. If the landlord will do this though, I don&apos;t know.

My roommates are understandably displeased and are concreting plans to move out en masse. I&apos;m not really inclined to go with them since, as I mentioned, there is a certain disparity in how sociable we are. Ideally, I&apos;ll get to stay in this house till the end of March and then I&apos;ll move somewhere else. Gonna get to see how that pans out.</event>

Fyi, PC Mauritania has some folks headed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lulusclub.com&quot;&gt;Lulu&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; tonight for booze, beads, booty bumpin&apos; and boobs (inch&apos;allah). Supposedly they&apos;re gonna have a pretty good event. You ought to come out. Mardi Gras is the only holiday specifically devoted to debauchery. It&apos;d be a shame to not be drunk somewhere. &amp;#x263A;</body>

			<subject>Head Injuries</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;There have been a couple changes going on in my life that tie in with head injuries&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that my house is emptying like a sinking ship. In the course of the last week three of my five roommates have moved out. In addition to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivankara.livejournal.com/52903.html&quot;&gt;bills debacle&lt;/a&gt;, the landlord was talking about having the tenants shoulder half the burden of the cost of repairs for stuff like the shitpool that occupied our downstairs last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked Giacomo and Erin, but the real gem being lost here is Mary. A half-Chinese American who worked at Starbucks when not doing o-chem, she had that sort of abruptness that I always find so abruptness. During a recent discussion of whether or not oral sex was degrading to the performer I walked into the kitchen and without any pretext asked her if she practiced and enjoyed carpet munching. The fact that I both felt comfortable asking her that and that she fielded the question frankly and without missing a bit speaks highly of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary is not terribly fond of her job at &quot;Starfucks&quot; as she affectionately calls it. A couple weeks ago she decided that she needed a little break from the daily grind, but how to get this? Well, she called Erin on the phone and explained her dilemma and then a potential solution. It turns out that certain types of psychologically traumatizing events qualify for paid time off from Starbucks. Among these is getting injured during the course of a mugging. Rather than walking around shady neighborhoods at night, with the incumbent risk of death that carries, she decided to eliminate the middle man and, while she was on the phone with Erin, smacks herself in the face with a Starbucks thermos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve never done it myself, but it is apparently difficult to punch oneself in the face especially hard. Mary is a persistent sort however and after a few tries she managed to bludgeon herself to the point of blackening her eye:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 100%; margin: auto&quot; src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/albums/mary_takes_a_break/Day_2_I_HATE_my_life.sized.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mary&apos;s Day Off&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday was Mardi Gras. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lulusclub.com/&quot;&gt;Lulu&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; was disappointing. I was lit by a fire eater, but it was outside after we left. The inside had no dancing to justify the $20 cover.) Mardi Gras, of course, is the day of excess which marks the period of purgation that is Lent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I have done some fairly challenging things for Lent. In Mauritania I forswore English both years and it was very productive. This year I&apos;m dealing with the stress of moving to the States and starting a new job and a new lifestyle, so I&apos;m going a less challenging path. Initially I was going to no booze for the whole period. I don&apos;t really have a problem with how much I drink, but I do recognize that it is a major part of my social life. Whenever I go out to a dinner party I have some wine, for pool or parties there&apos;s always a beer, out dancing I pretty much always have a mixed drink or two. I just don&apos;t think that it should have to be a part of having a good time and want to work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that it apparently is a part of having a good time. Not all the time, but going out drinking and dancing is a distinctly different experience from just going out dancing. I like the dancing, but if the DJ is mediocre (as most in DC are) the booze helps sort of gloss over the less danceable songs and keep me groovin&apos; on the dancefloor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I struck a balance and will only drink once a week and last night was the night. I started out at a party to say goodbye to one of MPP&apos;s fine IT staff, Sean, who is heading Las Vegas for a while to work a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regulatemarijuana.org&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, I had to leave as things were heating up because I&apos;d promised Cat and Lesley that were they ever to go dancing I&apos;d be there and last night was the night to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fivedc.com&quot;&gt;five&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get there it took me a while to find the girls and when I did Lesley pulls me in close and tells me she doesn&apos;t really like the guy dancing up on her and asks me to step in. Well, being a gentleman I was obliged to lend my aid to an attractive young lady in distress so I start working my way into the mix and cutting the guy off. Apparently he sensed what was going on and was less than entertained at the development. To his credit, I did get there an hour or so after they all did so I was interfering in a semi-serious time investment on his part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How he chose to deal with it was not terribly inventive. When I dance I take my glasses off because my hair gets sweaty and it just makes a mess. Because I didn&apos;t have my glasses an and wasn&apos;t paying attention (and was drunk), I didn&apos;t see it coming at all when he blindsided me and punched me in the face. All in all I handled it well enough. The old wrestling instincts kicked in and I hooked his arm and drug him to the floor with me. I had no real desire to hit him, I just wanted to stop him from hitting me any more. Fortunately some other fellows helped me out, and once he was on the floor they sat on his chest and let me disentangle myself. He ran off before the bouncers got there and I went back to dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn&apos;t really realize in the excitement, but remembered this morning is that as we were tussling he punched me in the back of the head four or five times. My face doesn&apos;t really hurt and the gooseegg over my eye is fading, but the back of my head is all lumpy and hurts like a son of a bitch. All in all it was a new adventure. Not something I want to repeat especially. Hopefully the next guy that has a problem with me at least has the courtesy to call me some names and push me about a bit before punching me. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>The girl in question has a love of Jesus that keeps her from enjoying the company of mere mortals until she marries one of them. Her love of beer however enables her to make out with the occasional dickhead on the dance floor.

I&apos;m pursuing lovin&apos; in other venues that don&apos;t have the Jesus complication. I&apos;ve set it as a goal in my relationships not to break anyone else. As entertaining as putting myself in a situation where my self-interest encourages me to erode deeply held convictions, when, as often as not, I win out, their head imploding is a total buzzkill.

I did however get some good dancing out of the evening. I learned that even mediocre techno can be entertaining if one has an attractive young lady grinding herself into one&apos;s person.

I heard good things about your bachelor party in Atlanta. Wayne really enjoyed himself. I really wish I could have made it down but alas DC is a damned long way away.</body>

				<body>A warm epsom salt compress helps break up the clots for it to heal faster.

I had a black eye back in January. The night I got it, I had it on ice. It was swollen completely shut the next day and I kept icing it. On the advice of a friend, I bought some epsom salt, dissolved it in hot water and started putting a compress on my eye from time to time, and it took less than a week for it to heal up to barely noticeable.

In the meantime I had a chance to sport a nice piratey eyepatch. Arrrrrr!</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I had a really fun yesterday. It just about ran me into the ground, but such seems to be the hallmark of my times as of late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: .5em;&quot; src=&quot;http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/GiantPandas/MeetPandas/images/cover_TaiFeb20-06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tai Shan&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started out with me sprinting to Union Station since I&apos;d found it much more pleasant to lay about snuggling with McKenzie than hauling my ass out of bed. I managed to make it to meet up with Karin a mere ten minutes late. &amp;#x263A; &lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: .5em;&quot; src=&quot;http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/AfricanSavanna/images/20050908-threecubs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cheetahs&quot; /&gt;
After explaining about how the repairs on the red line had the schedule all messed up and forced me to be late, we headed on the the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nationalzoo.si.edu&quot;&gt;zoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun was shining. The clouds hung picturesquely in a bright blue sky. Birds were out singing and enjoying the mid-70&apos;s temperatures. It was beautiful and a perfect day to be out. Unfortunately most all of &lt;acronym title=&quot;District of Columbia&quot;&gt;DC&lt;/acronym&gt; had picked up on this as well and al least half of them had decided to go to the zoo as well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of fun hanging out with Karin. We discussed a variety of subjects &lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: .5em; clear: right;&quot; src=&quot;http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/SmallMammals/images/covers/cover_armadillo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Armadillo&quot; /&gt; such as how good a panda skin rug would look in front of fireplace, how tender and delicious baby pandas likely are and the benefits of being reincarnated as a panda where your only job is to eat 40 pounds of bamboo a day and do fuck all.  These were sparked by the zoo&apos;s biggest star, the new baby panda, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/GiantPandas/&quot;&gt;Tai Shan&lt;/a&gt;. We got our panda viewing tickets without any problem, but the pandas were all sleeping and not all that entertaining aside from their ever present cuteness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually sleep turned out to be something of a theme. Pretty much any animal larger than a breadbox was unconscious. The notable exception were the orangutans. There are cables strung about 30 feet above the walkways at the zoo and the orangutans hold reign over these aerial byways. The same question occurred to Karin and myself simultaneously: a load of orangutan poopie falling 30 feet onto your head; emotionally scarring or funny anecdote?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: auto&quot; src=&quot;http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/Primates/MeetPrimates/MeetOrangs/images/OLinewithSky.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The O-Line&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of us had eaten breakfast and so we breezed by the second half of the zoo and headed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/dch_tourism2555/dch_tourism.htm?doc_id=44107&amp;area=2521&quot;&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; to find some lunch. We wandered about a bit trying to find a place that had food for less than $15 when we happened upon a little place called Tai Shan. Clearly this is where we were meant to be. &lt;img style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: .5em;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000EGCCM4.01-A2Q6PJDF32E7VU._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;golden&quot; /&gt; They had $4.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: .75em; vertical-align: text-top&quot;&gt;95&lt;/span&gt; lunch specials: perfect. I asked the waitress if they had any panda and she said &quot;no,&quot; but when she brought me my &quot;chicken&quot; she gave me a little wink. Once I started eating I realized that my chicken wasn&apos;t chicken! I know sweet and sour panda when I taste it. That or golden retriever; they&apos;re similar tastes. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that was unfortunately missing was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bubbletea.com&quot;&gt;bubble tea&lt;/a&gt;. Supposedly out in California these fruit based infusion teas with tapioca pearls in the bottom are so popular as to threaten &lt;a href=&quot;http://starbucks.com&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; market. Fad chaser that I am, I just had to try this latest rage, but didn&apos;t get the opportunity yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we headed back to Adams Morgan and went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bedrockbilliards.com/bedrockbilliards.html&quot;&gt;Bedrock Billiards&lt;/a&gt; where Karin schooled me mercilessly in checkers. Along the way we saw some of the teams from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://smashed.geekpad.com/idiotarod/&quot;&gt;Idiotarod&lt;/a&gt; running about with their shopping carts. I definitely want to do that next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post checkers it was starting to get dark and so I walked Karin back to her hotel, said goodbye and headed on the second half of the day: Cowboy Mouth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: auto&quot; src=&quot;http://www.cowboymouth.com/images/top.logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cowboy Mouth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</event>

				<body>Is Karen your other aunt? I can&apos;t remember.

Did you look at the Idiotarod website? For one they attempted to be linguistically friendly by translating &quot;shopping cart&quot; into a more familiar form for us southerners. They called it a &quot;carriage&quot; though, which I&apos;ve never really heard. I&apos;ve always heard &quot;buggy&quot;. More importantly, there was a link to the organization responsible for the Idiotarod in D.C. They call themselves SMASHED (Society of Mature Adults Seeking to Help, Entertain, and Donate). It looks like an attractive group to be involved in. Young, creative, hedonistic folks that like to offer their services to the world... you should check them out. Seems like a good place to meet people.</body>

			<subject>Irish Retirement Account</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;We had a meeting today about the company sponsored IRA. I was excited because, as a one-time owner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0974458902/sr=8-1/qid=1142372151/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-3960565-6815101&quot;&gt;The Anarchist Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; and a fellow lucky to still have all his fingers, I felt I might have something valuable to bring to the table. I practiced my accent to myself and made a sign that said &quot;reef, th&apos; limey bastards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I was disappointed. Apparently, our branch is mostly concerned with the financing of operations. I suppose that makes sense given that we&apos;re on the wrong side of the pond. The whole meeting though was about investing and other such boring things. The guy they sent over didn&apos;t even have an accent. I&apos;m pretty sure he was as American as I was. Maybe you have to start off at the bottom and after you prove yourself a bit you get to move into the real action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, he said that there were three things we should take from the meeting. I don&apos;t really what they&apos;ve got with liberating our people, but maybe one of y&apos;all can help me out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan your retirement like you&apos;re going to be taking a twenty year vacation. You don&apos;t want to have to stop and find more money in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&quot;Just Do It.&quot; &amp;copy; In thirty years a lot of the choices you make are not going to make a lot of a difference. The most important thing is to start doing something.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you get ready to retire, make sure that you&apos;ve got at least enough money for three years in cash or government bonds. Three to five years is how long it takes for a bad market to begin to rebound. Apparently most funds went down an average of 50% between 2000 and 2002. People who had to withdraw during that period were simply &lt;acronym title=&quot;shit out of luck&quot;&gt;sol&lt;/acronym&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</event>

				<subject>Equity, Retirement, Finances, and business stuff...</subject>
				<body>Another thing to consider is renting vs. owning. You should never rent unless its must-do and short term. Yes, I realize living in Cookeville for 8 years makes me a retard here, I should have bought a house, rented to roommates, and then, now that I&apos;ve left, I could sell the house and recoup most of what I spent on rent. Worst case is probably that I would have lost LESS than renting, and probably would have come out profitable.

Also, being in business for myself(1099 income instead of W-2), I have to hang on to my taxes(30% of each paycheck right now, but if things go well before the end of the year, it could go up...). This is good however, since I can save the money in a CD, high interest savings account(like ING Direct), or something productive with it, instead of letting the government have it all year.

Of course, I also try to save half my paycheck anyway(now that I have a real one).

Also, IRA&apos;s and other investments are nice, but they aren&apos;t REAL diversity: They are ALL in the stock market. Buying a good stock and holding it is a FAR better strategy than many things(including mutual funds). Of course, this requires knowing something about what you&apos;re invested in. Also, Dividends are nice(again, from directly owning the stock), since if you have enough stock that pays dividends, you could use that in your twilight years as well.

Of course, I&apos;ll repeat my first point, because its important: BUY don&apos;t Rent. Buying you build &quot;Equity&quot;, which is really nice, and if you pay reasonably close attention, most of the country, rents are the same, or even HIGHER than mortgage payments. Did I mention that mortgage payments are possibly tax deductible?(Rent definitely isn&apos;t however...).

Anyway, just some stuff to consider. I&apos;m living with my parents at the moment until a real estate agent can help me find something in my price range. I figure a 30-year fixed rate mortgage will get around a $100,000 home with 3 bedrooms(around here...) and the payments will be less than $500/mo. Which beats a 3 bedroom apartment hands down.

Oh yeah, getting &quot;stuck&quot; with a house isn&apos;t bad either: Rent it out. Also, while the population is increasing, the amount of land isn&apos;t(in fact, consider the case of Louisiana and hurricanes, heck, they&apos;re losing it).

Did I mention that 5 different ways to invest in the stock market doesn&apos;t count as &quot;diversification&quot;? 

And if the apocalypse comes, you can always fortify, plant a garden, and defend your holdings.

Honestly, I would pump the money into a mortgage instead of an IRA. I mean, really, I&apos;m all for revolutionary movements, especially ones with cool accents, but yeah, you&apos;re probably better off with a house...

				<subject>Re: Equity, Retirement, Finances, and business stuff...</subject>
				<body>I&apos;m not really sure on the mortgage bit. Definitely on the buying versus renting thing. I&apos;m giving some guy $650(12) = $7800 a year that could be staying with me in an investment in a house. I&apos;m just not sufficiently settled yet to make that kind of a commitment. (I don&apos;t know that I&apos;ll still be in the States in a year.)

You&apos;re not right on the IRA though. Right now all of my money will be in stocks since most growth funds are making around 12% which beats the hell out of the 4% I&apos;m getting on my &lt;acronym title=&quot;certificate of deposit&quot;&gt;CD&lt;/acronym&gt;. Apparently inflation tends to be about 3.5%, so the CD is just keeping my money from decreasing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americanfunds.com&quot;&gt;American Funds&lt;/a&gt; who will be managing my IRA has lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americanfunds.com/funds/by-objective.htm&quot;&gt;different funds&lt;/a&gt;. I could go for a bond fund if I wanted or a treasury security fund. Those would be safer funds, but given the length of time I&apos;m looking at, being aggressive with stocks is better for me.

Seems to me that the only way that putting the money in on a mortgage is going to be better for me, assuming I was willing to have the commitment, is if the house is going to be appreciating at better than 12%, right? Supposedly the housing market is inflated right now. People keep saying things should be going down.

I&apos;d go with your idea of playing the market. Except it takes time and energy I don&apos;t really feel like investing at this point. I&apos;m willing to sacrifice a few percentage points to let someone handle all that mess.</body>

				<subject>Re: Equity, Retirement, Finances, and business stuff...</subject>
				<body>You should read this: &lt;A href=&quot;http://ycombinator.com/munger.html&quot;&gt;A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom As It Relates To Investment Management &amp;amp; Business&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, the housing market is &quot;inflated&quot;. This means a lot of things. One of them is that banks are giving loans to people who can&apos;t make a down-payment and who are paying &quot;interest-only&quot; payments because they can&apos;t afford more. A lot of this is bad.

However, most of that inflation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation&quot;&gt;speculation&lt;/a&gt;. This will probably result in a market &quot;crash&quot;, and lots of people will go bankrupt, and yes, very likely some &quot;good&quot; deals on housing will emerge for a few years.

That doesn&apos;t mean its wrong to buy a house during a bubble. That just means you have to consider why you&apos;re buying it and what type of financing will be best for it(just like you would if there wasn&apos;t a bubble...).

You have to live somewhere. You don&apos;t have to have an IRA. What I&apos;m saying is that if I was forced to choose between renting and an IRA or a mortgage, I would pick the latter. My accountant wishes my business well, of his top 10 richest clients, 3 are entrepenuers. The other 7? Got their money from real estate. Also, if you live in a house for 2 years, currently, I think income from the sale will not be taxed(or taxed as highly).

The fact is, even if there was a market &quot;crash&quot;, and you sold the house at &quot;loss&quot; after a couple of years, as long you as you lose less than $7800 * Num_Years, you&apos;re still winning.

I didn&apos;t necessarily mean you shouldn&apos;t use an IRA. I just meant that there&apos;s a lot more to the story than retirement planning guru types like to tell you while pimping their investment services :). Also, DC is a different housing market than Greeneville(duh! ;) ). But I would seriously consider asking a realtor about something in your price range. Emphasize the need for something that will appreciate(even in a crash, there will still be people buying houses, and they will want some places more than others).

I don&apos;t intend to be in Greeneville longer than 3 years. I&apos;m still going to buy rather than rent. I understand the vague, hazy future. I&apos;m getting married in a little over a year, and I will have a wife who wants a hi-tech job too(in Chemistry), and let me tell you, those are about as common as programming jobs here(multiple shades of irony in that statement...).

Yeah, my goal is to have my money split into 7 radically different directions. Some of them include: Land, Stocks, Bonds, my business, the bank(CD&apos;s and savings account).

Part of the way to consider some forms of investment: Liquidity of the asset vs. reward. The less liquid something is, the more reward(bank&apos;s make this trade on checking vs. savings vs. certificates of deposit&apos;s). I have a &quot;tiering&quot; system for that: Goes into checking, once I get enough &quot;padding&quot;, I move it to the savings account. Once I get enough &quot;padding&quot; there to afford a CD, I move it into that. Once the CD gets big enough, I consider more creative options. Of course, this is because all my buffer was eaten up by grad school, so I&apos;m having to build back up for a while.

				<body>I would also note that our friend here lives in DC.  In DC on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage worth $100,000 you can get MAYBE a studio size condo in a bad neighborhood far from transit.  I just bought a 2 bedroom 1 bath house on a street where two kids were shot and killed in the past 4 months.  The house is 100 years old and needs extensive work.  It is as I said, not in the greatest of neighborhoods and does not include parking.  How much did I pay?  $300,000.  And it is widely said in these parts that I got a good deal.  Fact is if you can&apos;t afford a 750k plus house and are looking the DC market you are either going to get a tiny, old house in a bad neighborhood far from transit or will be looking in Pennsylvania, West Virginia or equally far out in Md. or Va.  At that rate you will be spending at least 3 hours per day commuting.  Sometimes it makes sense to rent, particularly when you are young and don&apos;t know where you will be in a year or two.</body>

			<event>Ok, very busy, but working a bit&amp;hellip; Stuff for the week:

My First Site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdmedicalmarijuana.org&quot;&gt;South Dakotans for Medical Marijuana&lt;/a&gt;

For &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/mortgage.xhtml&quot;&gt;mortgage calculator&lt;/a&gt; (which lets you find out how much house you can afford in addition to how much your payments will be) (if anyone can solve for the term or the rate as the unknown, that&apos;d kick ass), &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/MultipartPostHandler.py&quot;&gt;module to add multipart/form-data to python&apos;s urllib2&lt;/a&gt; (as described on &lt;a href=&quot;http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/146306&quot;&gt;ActiveState&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/set_trainer/&quot;&gt;set trainer&lt;/a&gt; works better (still broken at times, but better), and finally, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/fade_header/&quot;&gt;pretty layout&lt;/a&gt; I don&apos;t have a place to use currently.

Well, &lt;lj user=&quot;get_brett&quot;&gt; and &lt;lj user=&quot;jen_do&quot;&gt; are coming in and I need to go meet them.</event>

			<subject>Weekend</subject>
			<event>I need to take some time to write a bit. I&apos;ve been really bad about recording anything about this new chapter in my life and I&apos;m starting to regret it. I was cleaning my room today and I found a letter that I started to a friend back in Mauritania that starts with, &quot;I had a really awesome time this weekend&amp;hellip;&quot; I didn&apos;t finish the letter and I now have no clue either what weekend that was or what I might have been doing.

I&apos;m just going all the time and when I have some time off I tend to veg out rather than being productive.

So, this weekend&amp;hellip; I did the whole work thing on Friday. I&apos;d just shown off the products of a program I&apos;d been writing, and even though it still needs some work, I was a little burnt out on it so I spent most of the morning downloading &lt;a href=&quot;http://rvb.roosterteeth.com&quot;&gt;Red versus Blue&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;lj user=&quot;the_archange1&quot;&gt;&apos;s suggestion. That is a pretty good way to kill a morning. &amp;#x263A;

That night I went out with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=10653782930624225915&quot;&gt;new girlfriend&lt;/a&gt; and some of her friends. (Well, not really new, our first date was at the beginning of February.) We went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dcimprov.com&quot;&gt;DC Improv&lt;/a&gt; and saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisck.com&quot;&gt;Louis CK&lt;/a&gt;. He was pretty funny. No &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eddieizzard.com&quot;&gt;Eddie Izzard&lt;/a&gt;, but funny.

They were headed out to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homenightclub.net&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; which had a floor of Persian, a floor of Latin and a floor of Hip-Hop. I decided though to suck and so headed home for some sleep.

Part of why I needed my sleep is that since I&apos;d not gone on the camping trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/shen/&quot;&gt;Shenandoah&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, I was one of the few members of The Beltway Ballers left in town, and the interim captain. My discovery for the day was that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/wamo/&quot;&gt;Washington Monument&lt;/a&gt; is really big and because it is really big it makes it look like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/nacc/&quot;&gt;National Mall&lt;/a&gt; is short. It&apos;s not. Not at all. It is definitely not a short jog to traverse. It is a sufficient distance to instill in an out of shape person a serious desire to either pass out or vomit, possibly both.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickball.com&quot;&gt;kickball&lt;/a&gt; was awesome though. Everyone out there was mildly athletic so it wasn&apos;t ubercompetitive, but it wasn&apos;t boring either. The first inning of our first game the opposing team scored ten points, but after that we got it together and they only scored two for the rest of the game. Unfortunately we only really got our defense together and we only had one person even make it to third, so we lost pretty soundly. The next game though we won 2-0 and the final one 9-3. For our general lack of cohesion and coordination, we did pretty well.

I just really liked being out in the sunshine and running around. Everyone was really friendly and other than a couple people who I felt took the whole thing a little too seriously, a good time was had by all. Kevin and I had to hang out and ump a game and after that we headed to our sponsoring bar, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebottomlinedc.com&quot;&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/a&gt;. 4:00 on a Sunday seemed a little early for drinking, but they had $3 pitchers of Miller Light, so what the hell.

The alcohol helped deaden the throbbing pain that was my lower extremities. I don&apos;t yet own any tennis shoes, so I&apos;d done my jog down the Mall and the kickball game wearing my hiking boots. I&apos;m pretty sure this, the first physical activity I&apos;ve done in the last nine months or so, would have kicked my ass regardless, but my feet in particular were beating out even my fucked up sciatic nerve as the most painful part of my body. That is no mean feat.

So I wandered back toward McKenzie&apos;s after an unsuccessful attempt to buy shoes. (It was 6:00 by this point and everything closed.) I realized while on the train and I was feeling light headed that I wasn&apos;t drunk, but baked to a crisp. My arms and face aren&apos;t the pretty pink of a girl&apos;s summer dress, but the deep red of a well-boiled lobster. Thankfully, McKenzie allowed me to pass out at her place despite reportedly smelling like a beer soaked sweat sock. Bless her heart. &amp;#x263A;

I have only vague memories of her giving me water every so often through the evening and poking fried tofu at me which I stuck in my mouth and apparently passed out without eating since it was still in there when I woke up in the morning. We lie about for a bit and then she headed off to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savedarfur.org/rally/&quot;&gt;Darfur rally&lt;/a&gt; and I went home for cleaning and trying to will my flesh into being uncooked. (That doesn&apos;t seem to do much unfortunately.) I do seem to be able to sort of hobble again without too much pain, so hopefully I&apos;ll be able to make it to the office tomorrow.</event>

			<subject>disciplines</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This entry was being weird and not showing up, so I&apos;m going to try reposting it. If it has shown up twice for you, I apologize.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The lesson for today, boys and girls is about women and why not to irritate them&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our story begins a week ago when Leah from Senegal was in town. Leah and I had a brief series of trysts back during my Africa days which were only really remarkable in the damage they did to my psyche in ending. I&apos;ve received some abuse from women during my times, but generally no more than I&apos;ve deserved. This was the first time that I&apos;d been pretty much unabashedly nice to a person and had them treat me poorly. After failing to find my solace in heavy drinking, running dope and getting put in jail, I generally came to terms with the whole ordeal and went on my way a bit more jaded, but not permanently damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&apos;t trying to avoid her, but when I found out that Audrey was having a dinner party and that I would get to play adult, I was a bit relieved. Well, dinner was lovely and I really enjoyed sitting around discovering that my friends are not only fun, but smart to boot. It&apos;s difficult to actually talk to people when hanging out in a bar (or hammered), so our conversations ranging from childhood anecdotes to politics to development to entertainment was a refreshing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round about 1am I started getting messages from Marc and Kathleen prompting me to come take part in their more licentious festivities. Marc somehow thought that emphasizing Leah&apos;s stunning condition would prompt me to make an appearance. After the fourth message going on at length about her hotness I responded inquiring as to how her amazing attractiveness was going to cheer me any. Perhaps if she&apos;d grown obscenely obese or gotten knocked up, this I&apos;d want to see. Hot though? This is no reason to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly as he went on about her hotness I realized that I felt quite the opposite. I didn&apos;t feel especially pretty either physically, mentally or emotionally. It was in this moment of realization that I resolved to be a grown-up and do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I&apos;m employed and reasonably well paid. I&apos;ve put on seven or eight pounds since returning to the States, but I&apos;ve hardly ballooned out of control. I&apos;ve been staying up too late, but I&apos;ve generally been making it to work before noon and I almost never fall asleep at my desk. That is to say, I&apos;m not a wreck, I&apos;m just not what I feel I could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, self-improvement&amp;hellip; I figured I&apos;d start out reasonably and started listing potential activities. Here&apos;s what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditate 20min/day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 sets of 25 curls @ 30lbs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In bed by 11pm on weeknights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No processed sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arrive at &lt;acronym title=&quot;the Marijuana Policy Project&quot;&gt;MPP&lt;/acronym&gt; by 9am and leave by 6:30pm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200 sit-ups and 50 push-ups 3 times/week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No eating out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only fruits and vegetables for snacks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No profanity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No masturbation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Journal 3 times/week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now discipline is easy to break without either a strong constitution (which I am trying to develop) or some outside consequences. Since I&apos;ve not got the constitution down I decided to recruit some consequences. My consequences are named McKenzie who took the list and picked the three she would most like to see me do and, just to entertain me, the three she
thought I&apos;d probably pick. For mine she added a new one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No computer outside of work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is mostly just because I have a tendency to start screwing around on the computer and not get off until I pass out on the keyboard around 3am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, from those, I ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditate 20min/day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arrive at &lt;acronym title=&quot;the Marijuana Policy Project&quot;&gt;MPP&lt;/acronym&gt; by 9am and leave by 6:30pm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200 sit-ups and 50 push-ups 3 times/week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any failure to be disciplined would require a penance. The penance will be decided by McKenzie and there are three criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can&apos;t go against my moral code. Given how loose my moral code is, this pretty much bars most murders and selling children on the black market (unless they&apos;re really annoying)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can&apos;t cost more that $20&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can&apos;t require more than an hour of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herein lies our lesson on a woman irritated. At the end of week one I&apos;ve had three failings. Twice I stayed out too late and missed the sitting. My attempt to do push-ups was successful, but left me unable to lift my arms higher than my shoulders for three days. So McK had some leverage. This is something I likely should have considered before taunting her about not letting her read my friends only entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My old penance? Buy a chocolate bar and pay her the remaining $19 for the privilege of orally pleasuring her while feeding it to her. The revised penance? Wearing a &quot;subtle layer of make-up&quot; and fire engine red nail polish to my weekly 15&amp;#xA2; wings and pool night with the gang from the &lt;acronym title=&quot;République Islamique de la Mauritanie&quot;&gt;RIM&lt;/acronym&gt;. Dammit all.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m being mildly productive today which is a nice change of pace from my complete lack of productivity yesterday. In honor of Mexico defeating the French at Puebla in 1862, I&apos;ve made a banana pudding and I&apos;m off to eat it with some grilled meat this evening. The Mexico bit moreso enters with the dozen lemons and limes that will accompany a bunch of tequila into my belly with the pudding and meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;&apos;ve been trying to find a reference to a study I remember seeing in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tug.org&quot;&gt;T&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: sub&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; documentation which covered reader comprehension as a function of line length. It tried to support with science the old newspapermen&apos;s addage that lines should not be more than 10-15 words. It is supposedly why newspapers and T&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: sub&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X documents are frequently columnated. It made the case that people process information by lines as they are reading and if the line is too long the brain gets confused trying to hold the whole thing. All they did was give people reading selections columnated to different lengths and compared their comprehension. I can&apos;t find the study, but I did find some interesting figures from Colin Wheildon&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worsleypress.com/type/&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Type &amp;amp; Layout&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switching from full justified text to ragged right drops the percentage of readers with good comprehension of the contents from 67% to 38%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switching from serif to sans serif body type drops good comprehension from 67% to 12%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any text color but black drastically reduces comprehension &amp;mdash; to 51% for a dark color, 29% for a medium color, and 10% for a bright color&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Black text on colored tints of 10% or less works fine. On darker tints, comprehension drops rapidly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 75%;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention in human history &amp;mdash; with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

			<subject>Ghetto</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;So, I suck. Some people are mentally retarded. Others are emotionally retarded. What&apos;s the term for the capacity to get your shit together? What was that word from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spellingbee.com&quot;&gt;spelling bee&lt;/a&gt; the other night? Poiesis: the capacity for creation. That&apos;s not quite right. It isn&apos;t that I don&apos;t have the tools, I&apos;m just too fucking dumb to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I got out of bed at a reasonable Saturday hour, but then started watching some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeeperscreepers-themovie.com&quot;&gt;idiotic show&lt;/a&gt; and managed to miss my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickball.com&quot;&gt;kickball game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing where I get distracted by something trivial and miss something important happens fairly frequently. It&apos;s just so easy to get involved in something and forget about time. It&apos;s why working twelve hours days is easy for me. It&apos;s also though why at the end of a twelve hour day I discover I&apos;ve accomplished something completely other than what I set out to do. (&lt;em&gt;Note my &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/risk.pl&quot;&gt;second half of Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m reminded of that article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html&quot;&gt;geekiness and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in my feeling of wastefulness, I resolved not to watch any more TV by myself. I&apos;ve been doing it far too much, especially since I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_pvr500mce.html&quot;&gt;tuner card&lt;/a&gt; in a flash of ill-planned impulse buying. (&lt;acronym title=&quot;By the way&quot;&gt;Btw&lt;/acronym&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mythtv.org&quot;&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; rocks.) I figure I&apos;ll still get plenty of the boob tube since &lt;a href=&quot;http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=80133939&quot;&gt;McK&lt;/a&gt; and I watch a minimum of five episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/&quot;&gt;Scrubs&lt;/a&gt; per week. (God bless them &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepiratebay.org&quot;&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a nap I was left with the conundrum of what to do. Having spazzed my way through my only social engagement for the day, I was left with no real reason to get out of bed. With no TV to numb my brain though, I was finding bed kinda boring. I decided I&apos;d try and hunt down &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B00031WUQI/002-5735892-2785620&quot;&gt;Finley&apos;s Boxing&lt;/a&gt; which Amazon says is the closest gym to my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a seven block walk, I found Finley&apos;s to have become an auto repair shop. It was sunny though and residential DC is pretty, so I figured I&apos;d wander for a bit more. Pretty soon I eneded up on H Street. I don&apos;t know DC geography all that well, but I know H Street is where McK says she won&apos;t go with me to buy stuff. It was also where, during my eight block walk home, I did not pass another white male. I kinda liked it even if I did stick out a bit. I liked for much the same reason I liked Africa. No, not the bunches of blacks folks: it was less polished. It felt more raw and real somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured as long as I was out I&apos;d try and spend some money. Help out the community and what-not. It turned out to be kinda hard. The stores were aimed mostly at crappy instant gratification sorts of purchases: lots of clothing, cell phones, liquor and beauty supplies. The grocery store I went in had one of its four isles devoted to candy, but didn&apos;t sell oatmeal. I managed to pick up some socks and dryer sheets, but even those were from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riteaid.com&quot;&gt;Rite-Aid&lt;/a&gt;. All in all the day had the feel of a depressing field trip. There were some funny quotes though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0&quot;&gt;&quot;Last time I come in here looking for envelopes, they sent me all over looking for them. They can&apos;t speak English here at all.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0 3em 1em 5em&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash; Overheard in the dollar store; &quot;envelopes&quot; was pronounced so as to rhyme with &quot;develops&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0&quot;&gt;&quot;Anger is what you feel when you have to get up at 4:15 in the morning to go be a slave to the white man.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0 3em 1em 5em&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash; What the Nation of Islam street preacher was saying into his bullhorn as I was walking by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;cite&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/cite&gt;, that&apos;s a new book, isn&apos;t it?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0 3em 1em 5em&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash; Question from the owner of the used book store&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>D&apos;accord, je vais essayer d&apos;écrire un petit peu en français même si je ne l&apos;avais pas fait depuis six mois. Je le fais grâce á aujourd&apos;hui je me suis acheté un cadeau: &lt;a href=&quot;http://cgi.ebay.fr/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=6059297902&quot;&gt;Les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux&lt;/a&gt;.

Pour les gens qui connaissent, Loups-Garous est un jeu comme &quot;Mafia&quot; aux États-Unis. Tout le monde fait semblant d&apos;être les villageois de Thiercelieux. Ils dorment, se cachent leurs eux, puis les loups-garous se réveillent et égorgent quelqu&apos;un. Le lendemain, les villageois restant choissent une entre eux de lyncher. Le cycle continue jusque soit tout les villageois sont morts ou tout les loups-garous.

&lt;em&gt;Christ, this is hard. I know the words, but I don&apos;t know where to put them.&lt;/em&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Time wasting for the day was finishing up some stuff to get it send off to the &lt;acronym title=&quot;Répulique Islamique de la Mauritanie&quot;&gt;RIM&lt;/acronym&gt;. I&apos;ve got some misencoded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matroska.org&quot;&gt;Matroska&lt;/a&gt; files to deal with still, but the song &lt;acronym title=&quot;Digital Versatile Disk&quot;&gt;DVD&lt;/acronym&gt; is fast approaching completion. I spent the morning piddling with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/songlist_processing/&quot;&gt;makefile to process playlists&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing major, but it does help me get a DVD burned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need about another 50 songs, so if you&apos;ve got time, feel free to peruse the list and make suggestions. No artist gets more than two songs. (Compilations don&apos;t count.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The song list is way too long to post here, (I can&apos;t get more than five letters to a post) so I&apos;ll put it up elsewhere shortly&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Chansons Passables</subject>
			<event>So, LiveJournal didn&apos;t like me trying to post my whole song list for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivankara.livejournal.com/56548.html&quot;&gt;good songs DVD&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s fair since there are more than 1000 songs. Anywho, if anyone makes some good suggestions, I&apos;ll send along a copy of the finished product. (No artist gets more than two songs.) The list is &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/songlist_processing/chansons_passables.table.html&quot;&gt;up on my site&lt;/a&gt;.

Or I would send you a copy if it was not illegal. In fact there&apos;s no DVD at all. This is only the songs I would put on a DVD if I were trying to make a DVD of good songs. I don&apos;t even have these songs. In fact, I don&apos;t even know how to use a computer. And I&apos;m deaf. What am I doing here? I&apos;m going to find a nice book. Don&apos;t sue me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riaa.com&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Recording Industry Association of America&quot;&gt;RIAA&lt;/acronym&gt;!</event>

				<body>I would add some Modest Mouse -- _I Came As a Rat_ is my favorite though Matt likes _Alone Down There_

I would also suggest Tom&apos;s Diner by Suzanne Vega though mostly because it entertains me.

Other favorites of mine include

Presidents of the US remake of Video Killed the Radio Star
Iron &amp; Wine&apos;s Such Great Heights
EMF&apos;s Unbelievable
Maverick&apos;s I Want to Know

I can come up with some more too.  Matt and I use the term BSE (best songs evah) for our lists of music.  We each have one on our respective iPods.

I&apos;ve love to have this mythical DVD and can send you a mythical CD of anything I recommend.  I&apos;ll tell Matt he needs to make some recommendations.  He&apos;s the true music affectionado of the two of us.  We&apos;re currently collecting cd&apos;s from the bands on the Austin City Limits line up since we have tickets to go to it in September.</body>

				<body>Le DVD a besoin de Jonathan Coulton. 

http://jonathancoulton.com/songs

Peut etre, _Skullcrusher Mountain_ ou _Code Monkey_ ou _Ikea_? J&apos;aime aussi _Dance, Soterios Johnson, Dance_ et _Tom Cruise Crazy_. Lese chansons qui sont pas libre, frequentment tu peux chercher dans le blog ou sont le linques libre.</body>

			<subject>H.264</subject>
			<event>More geekery. Today&apos;s fun centered around videos and trying to get the damned things to play. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/songlist_processing/&quot;&gt;good songs DVD&lt;/a&gt; is part of a larger project to send a bunch of stuff off to Mauritania. Another bit of that is a couple DVDs, one with &lt;a href=&quot;htt://nbc.com/Scrubs/&quot;&gt;Scrubs&lt;/a&gt; and another with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/coupling/&quot;&gt;Coupling&lt;/a&gt;.

Through the magic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bittorrent.com&quot;&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt;, I have all the episodes of both, but Coupling will only play in &lt;a href=&quot;http://xinehq.de&quot;&gt;Xine&lt;/a&gt;. This isn&apos;t a huge problem for me since I&apos;m a geek and have Xine on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxjournal.com&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; box. It is a problem though for the non-geek people I&apos;m sending this to. So, I needed to fix it. The only problem is I know diddly about video stuff.

Well, the file extensions are mkv, so I started there. It turns out that mkv stands for &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matroska.org&quot;&gt;Matroska&lt;/a&gt; video.&quot; When you watch a video on your computer you are not just watching, you are listening as well. The computer needs information about how the audio and the video sync up in order to play correctly. Matroska is a format to describe that. Another container format that I&apos;m sure most everyone has seen is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q316992#16&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Audio Video Interleave&quot;&gt;avi&lt;/acronym&gt; format&lt;/a&gt;.

In looking on the Matroska site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Video LAN Client&quot;&gt;VLC&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of their recommended players and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mplayerhq.hu&quot;&gt;MPlayer&lt;/a&gt; is supported as well and neither works. So, more digging is in order&amp;hellip;

I found some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/&quot;&gt;tools for manipulating mkvs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mkvinfo&lt;/code&gt; let me know that my files contained an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vorbis.com&quot;&gt;Ogg Vorbis&lt;/a&gt; sound stream and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264&quot;&gt;H.264/&lt;acronym title=&quot;Motion Pictures Expert Group&quot;&gt;MPEG&lt;/acronym&gt;-4 &lt;acronym title=&quot;Advanced Video Coding&quot;&gt;AVC&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt; video stream. (Matroska looks to be a pretty &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_container_formats&quot;&gt;intriguing format&lt;/a&gt;, supporting things like multiple audio channels and subtitles.)

This was interesting as as H.264 is pretty new and the only place I&apos;ve seen it so far is in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPTV&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Internet Protocol Television&quot;&gt;IPTV&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; on hacker sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://hak5.org&quot;&gt;Hak5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fromtheshadows.tv&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;From the Shadows&quot;&gt;FTS&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I was pretty sure this was where the problem since Ogg is old.

Well, I wandered the internet trying to find someone else having a similar problem, but to no avail. So then I decided to reencode the files. If you&apos;ve ever seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117108/&quot;&gt;Multiplicity&lt;/a&gt;, you are familiar with the &quot;copy of a copy&quot; principle. Every time, some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doom9.org/index.html?/codecs-final-105-2-hq.htm&quot;&gt;data is lost&lt;/a&gt; and you never do anything but get further from the original. I was pretty much stymied, so I figured I&apos;d bite the bullet.

None of the tools on my &lt;a href=&quot;http:///fedora.redhat.com&quot;&gt;Fedora Core 4&lt;/a&gt; machine could encode H.264, so I decided instead to encode to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4&quot;&gt;MPEG-4&lt;/a&gt;. It took me a bit to figure out how to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu&quot;&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/a&gt; to do it, but eventually, &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/Makefile.Coupling&quot;&gt;I got it working&lt;/a&gt;.

Lesson #1. Encoding video takes for freaking ever. The MPEG encoding is a two pass process where the first pass collect some statistics and the second uses those to encode the file. These episodes of Coupling and about 50 minutes and 688px x 400px. On my 1.7gHz processor it takes about 25 minutes per pass.

Lesson #2. Whoever created these files did some magic. The original file, which looks really good, is 205mb. My MPEG-4 was over 400. This is not an acceptable increase. If I hadn&apos;t seen how little they could be, I&apos;d probably accept it since I expect a two hour movie to be around 1.5gb. Since I know it is possible to do it in less space though, I am bound and determined to match that.

I&apos;m currently running the video through &lt;a href=&quot;http://developers.videolan.org/x264.html&quot;&gt;x264&lt;/a&gt; to see if I can&apos;t get some better compression. In this one each pass takes about an hour and a half, so I&apos;ve got some waiting yet to do. I&apos;ll post the result.</event>

				<body>Will,

If your target audience is going to view the material on computer, I highly suggest formatting the DV as realplayer.  AFAIK, and I know quite a lot about this, realplayer is the single smallest non-proprietary compression format you can find.  I have transformed 63 gig of raw video footage into a 12 kb (yes *k*b) file.  Of course it was tiny, tiny, but you get the picture, I&apos;m sure.  A more viewable format was around several dozen mb.

Good luck with the video files, they can be quite annoying little bastards.

				<body>I suggest you export the movie, frame by frame, as a sequence of RAW images. Record the audio to a record. Code something to play back the video on your computer, play the audio on a record player, and keep the audio in sync with the video by skillful application of friction on the turntable.

I don&apos;t know much but I do know this: You will have a very, very, very hard time trying to convert the video from mkv to mp4 without losing much quality and staying near the original bitrate, at least with programs that are freely available.

On the other hand, mkv is just a container, and that should be honest to god mp4 and Ogg Vorbis data in there, as far as I know. If you can figure out a good way to extract and rewrite it, it should be doable without any loss, right? Right? Those are the words of someone who has never tried to do this.</body>

I&apos;ve been pulling between 600 and 700 kilobits the whole time. It&apos;s going to take about an hour and a half to download the 3gb file.

  &lt;li&gt;Went looking for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firefoxflicks.com&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; extension to show me &lt;acronym title=&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/acronym&gt; traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/138/&quot;&gt;StumbleUpon extension&lt;/a&gt; and installed it along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/966/&quot;&gt;Tamper Data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got stuck on trying to replicate a POST request and started piddling around with StumbleUpon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ended up at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm&quot;&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt; which is sort of like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pandora.com&quot;&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt; except music recommendations are made on user submissions rather than an external sorting system: very &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/web20.html&quot;&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Music has been really big for me as of late, so I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/user/ivankara/&quot;&gt;created an account&lt;/a&gt; and installed the monitoring agent, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/downloads.php&quot;&gt;Audioscrobbler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This allows for the creation of a pretty &lt;a href=&quot;http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/ivankara/recenttracks.rss&quot;&gt;playlist&lt;/a&gt;, so I thought I&apos;d stick that in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivankara.livejournal.com&quot;&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was the process of playing with that, that I killed my journal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since I spend a minimum of $20 when I go out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebighuntdc.com&quot;&gt;drinkin&apos;&lt;/a&gt;, I went ahead and got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/shop/&quot;&gt;paid account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I need now is time to fix the site. You&apos;d not think that I was a professional web designer to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stderr.org/~will/&quot;&gt;my sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m just curious if my new paid account will strip out non-HTML tags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Proof that Girls are Evil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Girls require time and money&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;math mode=&quot;display&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;

      &lt;mo&gt;x&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;mi&gt;$&lt;/mi&gt;
    &lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time is money&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;math mode=&quot;display&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/math&gt;
    &lt;math mode=&quot;display&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;
      &lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x2234;&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x2640;&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;mi&gt;$&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;mo&gt;x&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;mi&gt;$&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;msup&gt;
        &lt;mi&gt;$&lt;/mi&gt;
        &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;
      &lt;/msup&gt;
    &lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Money is the root of all evil&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;math mode=&quot;display&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;
      &lt;mi&gt;$&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;msqrt&gt;
        &lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x2646;&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;/msqrt&gt;
    &lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quid Erat Demonstrandum&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;math mode=&quot;display&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;
      &lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x2640;&lt;/mi&gt;
      &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;msup&gt;
        &lt;mi&gt;$&lt;/mi&gt;
        &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;
      &lt;/msup&gt;
      &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;msup&gt;
        &lt;msqrt&gt;
          &lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x2646;&lt;/mi&gt;
        &lt;/msqrt&gt;
        &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;
      &lt;/msup&gt;
      &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;
      &lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x2646;&lt;/mi&gt;
    &lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it leaves the tags, but I can&apos;t serve the page as &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml xml&lt;/code&gt;, so the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Math/&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Mathematics Markup Language&quot;&gt;MathML&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about forms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;form action=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Button&quot; onclick=&quot;alert(&apos;Scripts work: &apos;   window.location)&quot;&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like I still can&apos;t do scripting. C&apos;est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>Dude, If I had, I almost certainly would have put it in the list of links on the page where you got all those. Though to be fair, I&apos;ve not updated &lt;a href=&quot;http://mr.pcvs.org&quot;&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt; in about a year now. You don&apos;t have a list of PC Gambia sites, do you? Or Senegal? There are so many people I&apos;m curious about.</body>

			<subject>Three Little Words</subject>
			<event>I got to DC almost exactly six months ago. In my first couple weeks of house hunting, I saw this really cool place that I really liked. I was saddened not to have gotten in, but the message informing me of that fact was interesting. It was one of the housemates telling me that she&apos;d pulled for me hard, but it didn&apos;t work out. What made it interesting was the undercurrent of flirtation. So, I responded with something peppy, brushed off the rejection and dropped a few questions. A conversation ensued and soon I found myself in a relationship.

I liked this girl quite a bit. She was smart, candid, adventurous and sexual. We had a really good time together seeing the city getting to know each other. I won&apos;t say it was a storybook romance, but it really was about as free and open as I have felt in a relationship.

Round about three months our intimacy and familiarity had continued to the point that I started having the impulse to tell her that I loved her. I&apos;ve never been the first one to do this and honestly Africa left me a little jaded. When the feeling would come up I&apos;d just sort of enjoy the feeling, but never say the words. I figured that was what was important and that the words were just secondary.

But they&apos;re not, of course. If the words didn&apos;t matter it wouldn&apos;t be hard to say them. What I didn&apos;t realize until the feelings started to change is that I wasn&apos;t just deciding not to say, &quot;I love you:&quot; I was deciding to play it safe and not make myself vulnerable to this other person.

The image that comes to mind now is a little fetus growing in its mother&apos;s womb. As time goes on legs and arms and eyes and a nose grow. Sometimes though something goes wrong. Maybe mommy smokes or some of her chromosomes don&apos;t line up like they do in most people. For whatever reason something gets off in the development process. Maybe one of the arms comes in crooked or whatever. As time goes on these little problems effect later things until eventually the sick little baby just quietly passes away.

The image is a little dramatic, but that&apos;s what I keep seeing. Not because I want to compare my relationship to a miscarriage, but rather to something delicate and growing and, I&apos;m afraid, having been dealt a fatal blow through a bad decision.

Because I like talking to her and doing things with her and generally being her boyfriend. How I feel affection for her has changed though. I feel like I&apos;ve got a really good friend that I have sex with, but I&apos;m not sure that I&apos;ve got a lover. While I certainly enjoy having a good friend to have sex with, it matters to me that the relationship has the potential of going somewhere. I&apos;m old and I want kids. Every decision is going to take me closer or farther away from the life I want to be living after another thirty years. While this is fun in the here and now, I just can&apos;t weigh that against what I feel like I&apos;m giving up on.

So, we&apos;re going to have a talk. We&apos;ll see how that goes.</event>

				<body>*fingers crossed that it works out however it needs to*

y&apos;know, i&apos;ve been thinking all day, wanting to write a reply to the comment you put in my journal with the fetus metaphor.  it&apos;s incredibly powerful on a lot of levels... translates all the sick anxiety of trying to decide how much deformity is too much, whether or not to carry to term in spite of everything because it&apos;s still alive... for now... argh.

an honest talk seems to be the best way to skip on over to the train wreck side of things... or to make a narrow miss.  i think i usually precipitate things by being unable to hide the fact that something&apos;s getting under my skin, but usually can&apos;t wrap words around it all until after the fact.  congrats on having the sense to act instead of jitter.

*hugs* </body>

			<subject>Banks</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;So, I dislike my bank. When I got to the States, I needed to move fast to start my new job, so I went with BB&amp;T because my parents used them and they had branches in Tennessee and D.C. So far though, I&apos;d estimate I&apos;ve paid them at least $100 in fees, and I&apos;m tired of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I opened my account with them, I decided to put $5000 in one of their &lt;acronym title=&quot;Certificate of Deposit&quot;&gt;CD&lt;/acronym&gt;s. I knew that I was going to be moving and that my finances were uncertain. When I explained this to the guy opening the account and asked about transferring money in and out of the CD, he told me I could to so once a month without penalty. Once I got to D.C. I had to take some of it out to cover my security deposit and was promptly penalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month later I deposited my paycheck in an ATM. It turns out that the checks weren&apos;t signed. So, the bank removed that amount from my account. They didn&apos;t however remove the hold that had been placed on that amount, so effectively withdrew those checks twice, overdrawing my account. After going to the bank twice and getting the amount straightened out, I asked them to remove the $100+ in overdraft fees since they had overdrawn my account, not me. I called them twice and they kept saying they were doing it and finally they removed about $50 of them. I just didn&apos;t have the energy to keep calling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve never been in there and it taken less that fifteen minutes to do anything. I went it to close my CD yesterday and after almost 45 minutes and a lengthy phone conversation, one of the managers managed to get it closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m just tired of it and want a new bank. My money is currently broken down into four main categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Checking: Money for monthly expenses. All I need here is a check card of some sort and online bill payment. I didn&apos;t ever get a checkbook for my account because my address keeps changing and the only check I have to write is for rent. The one thing BB&amp;T has done right is making it easy to get a check sent to him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emergency Funds: This is a chunk of change for dealing with something like a car accident or chipped tooth or whatever. It needs to be accessible within three or four days. For this I&apos;ve got a savings account at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ingdirect.com&quot;&gt;ING Direct&lt;/a&gt; named &quot;BB&amp;T Sucks&quot; that&apos;s earning 4.35%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retirement: MPP does a &lt;acronym title=&quot;Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees&quot;&gt;SIMPLE&lt;/acronym&gt; &lt;acronym title=&quot;Individual Retirement Account&quot;&gt;IRA&lt;/acronym&gt; through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americanfunds.com&quot;&gt;American Funds&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;m withholding almost 20% at this point. I&apos;m trying to push my income as close to the $30,000 jump from 15% to 25% as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investing: This is still theoretical because I&apos;ve been upping my IRA withholding to compensate for extra money I have. (I&apos;m actually withholding 30% currently, but that will average out to 20% by the end of the year.) In a month or two though, I&apos;d like to put a couple thousand dollars in something, probably an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund&quot;&gt;index fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, does anyone have a bank they&apos;ve been really happy with? Branches in Tennessee and D.C. would be nice. Not sucking would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If anyone ever decides to open an ING account, let me know. For a referral, I get $10 and you get $25.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>Your bank sucks. Glad you&apos;re getting another one. Sadly enough, the only thing I&apos;ve found that works with getting good service is finding a smaller, more local bank(which would be a nix on the D.C./TN branches).

The nickel-and-diming thing is really annoying. I&apos;ve changed banks over that at the first fee which I feel is unjustified(one bank, seriously, had a $1000 minimum balance requirement otherwise pay an $8/mo fee, and I was unemployed. I told them if they didn&apos;t waive that or provide me a more palatable an option, I was leaving. They laughed at me, so I closed the account immediately).

				<body>Yeah, I got hit with a $14.95 fee this month because I&apos;d moved a bunch of money over to ING and my combined CD/checking balance fell below $5000. How&apos;s that for a pain?</body>

			<subject>Extras</subject>
			<event>I&apos;m still working out the ins and out of the banking bit. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bankofamerica.com&quot;&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt; has been the most recommended bank, but they require direct deposit on their free account or there&apos;s a $5.95 monthly charge. Currently my paycheck goes straight into my &lt;a href=&quot;http://ingdirect.com&quot;&gt;ING Direct&lt;/a&gt; account which earns 4.35% as opposed to 0% with Bank of America. They do have a $50 signing bonus though which would make up for quite a bit of lost interest.

I suppose I am going to have to be moving money once a month in any case. Either into checking to pay my bills or out to a higher interest savings account. ING has an automatic deduction, so I could just set that up. Honestly, with a third of my paycheck going into my IRA, joining a gym, moving to a new house and starting to take the metro to work; my savings capacity is severely diminished. I probably ought to just switch and go with Bank of America.

BB&amp;amp;T is still in slight consideration since they have a free checking account with no strings. Also, while I was poking around today, I found their check card has a deal with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visaextras.com&quot;&gt;Visa Extras&lt;/a&gt;. Once I&apos;ve signed up, for every dollar I spend, I earn points. I was perusing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visaextras.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=VisaApp.CatalogSession&quot;&gt;catalog&lt;/a&gt; and, had I signed up initially, I could be well on my way to a $100 &lt;a href=&quot;http://lobstergram.com&quot;&gt;Lobster Gram&lt;/a&gt; gift certificate. Alas.</event>

				<body>BoA waived all the fees on the checking and savings acct.s I got when I moved to Chapel Hill for a whole year, you might go in to each bank and say, &quot;make a better deal&quot;. They&apos;re salespeople and I think they have some flexibility as to what they can offer. Also I&apos;ve overdrawn like 3 times, and each time they&apos;ve refunded all the penalty fees. :-P 

I think when we moved Jen filled out one of the change of address forms at the post office and got a $75 incentive dealio.

				<body>Will -
I use bank of america and have for 3 years now. in order to  save from getting fees and still be able to save , what if you did  half into your inf account and half into a checking account. That&apos;s what Bryan and I do. The biggest check goes into our checking account to pay for say bills and such. my check goes straight into our savings account to save for a rainy day or an emergency. Even when we were in richmond, we put half into one and half into the the other. Which your employer should let you split it into both accounts just give them a deposit slip for each account. and they&apos;ll fix it for you. Just a thought!!   -Julie West (Pippin)      </body>

			<event>So, I&apos;m an uncle now. Little Finn Lawson Holcomb was born 8lbs 5oz yesterday. I&apos;d post a picture of him, but the Verizon people are bitches and have disabled &lt;acronym title=&quot;Object Exchange&quot;&gt;OBEX&lt;/acronym&gt; on their Razr. They want to force me to pay them to get pictures off my phone and add ringtones. Greedy fuckers.</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dclug.tux.org&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;District of Columbia&quot;&gt;DC&lt;/acronym&gt; &lt;acronym title=&quot;Linux Users Group&quot;&gt;LUG&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt; listserv and someone mentioned getting hundreds of failed attempts to connect to the computer via &lt;acronym title=&quot;Secure Shell&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/acronym&gt;. I thought I&apos;d take a look and see if I was having anything like that. I took a look at &lt;code&gt;/var/log/secure&lt;/code&gt; and in the last three weeks there have been over 14,000 failed connections. michael, christopher, matthew, joshua, jacob, andrew, daniel, nicholas, tyler, joseph, david, brandon, james, john, ryan, zachary, justin, anthony, william, robert, jonathan, kyle, austin, alexander, kevin, cody, thomas, jordan, eric, benjamin, aaron, jose, christian, steven, samuel, brian, dylan, timothy, adam, nathan, richard, sean, charles, patrick, jason, luis, &amp;hellip; It just goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clearly won&apos;t do. It is highly unlikely this person is going to both guess my username and my password, but I just don&apos;t like that it is going on. So, I added these lines to the iptables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em; text-indent: -.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 1.5em; text-indent: -.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 -j DROP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, any more than three attempts to establish a connection to SSH within a minute period will cause any further connection attempts to drop. If I understand the code correctly as well, the count doesn&apos;t reset until a minute has passed, so if they keep hitting it constantly, it will never stop dropping them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they&apos;re smart, they could figure out it is resetting after a minute since rate-limiting isn&apos;t terribly creative. Pulling off a brute force attack with one attempt every twenty seconds will certainly take a while.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Why oh Y?</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;MPP has a deal with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ymcawashdc.org&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Young Men&apos;s Christian Association&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where, as a non-profit, they get 30% off all fees, so McK and I joined up. We went three times last week, and it was as unpleasant as starting back to the gym generally is. Yesterday was really interesting though: we had our introduction to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fitlinxx.com&quot;&gt;Fitlinxx&lt;/a&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&apos;ve got two rooms full of equipment with little touch screens next to each one. You sit down and enter your &lt;acronym title=&quot;personal identification number&quot;&gt;pin&lt;/acronym&gt;. Whenever you do a set, it tracks the speed of your time up and down, and it counts for you. They&apos;ve got some treadmills which will track your progress and there&apos;s a little kiosk where you can enter cardio stuff that you do on your own. If you graduate to the free weights then you have to write down your sets and you leave it for a trainer who enters the numbers for you. From talking to the guy, he seems to watch people who are working out and leaves little training notes for them in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was looking up Fitlinxx to link to them, I found all their data syncs online. Once I made myself an account, I can do stuff like see my stats and manually enter workouts. That&apos;s pretty cool. They show your stats as a function of everyday objects. In my workout yesterday, I lifted a total of 15,110lbs or five of the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vw.com/newbeetle/&quot;&gt;Beetles&lt;/a&gt;. That sounds much more impressive than the 35 gummi bears I burned off on the elliptical trainer. &amp;#x263a;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Configuration</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve spent the day lying around doing not much of anything. On &lt;lj user=&quot;the_archange1&quot;&gt;&apos;s recommendation, I watched the entire first season of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/&quot;&gt;The IT Crowd&lt;/a&gt;. (The site is interesting in that people outside the UK are not allowed to access the show clips.) Very funny show and worth a download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also played around with configuring my computer some to solve some problems. McK has been coming over after the gym and I&apos;ll rub her back while she relaxes. I like to watch TV while doing this, but for her, I want to play music. Well, my machine has two soundcards in it: an Audigy 5.1 channel card for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2177,CONTENTID=9586&quot;&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt; and then an onboard NVidia chip. It turns out that if I just pass &lt;code&gt;-ao alsa:device=hw=1,0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mplayerhq.hu&quot;&gt;MPlayer&lt;/a&gt;, it&apos;ll pipe the sound to that other card so I can listen on headphones. Handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve also been irritated that all the fancy keys on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=043&quot;&gt;Natural Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; don&apos;t work. Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;xev&lt;/code&gt; revealed that about half of them don&apos;t even result in keycodes getting sent in. I did however modify &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/config/bashrc&quot;&gt;my config&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;code&gt;xmodmap&lt;/code&gt; to get the forward and back buttons working for &lt;a href=&quot;http://amarok.kde.org&quot;&gt;Amarok&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>What Little Wills are Made Of</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;So I went to the Y and had my fitness tested. I failed solidly with a 36/100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t feel too bad about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I couldn&apos;t touch my toes because I&apos;ve got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spine-health.com/topics/cd/d_sciatica/sc01.html&quot;&gt;sciatica&lt;/a&gt; and there&apos;s not too much to do about it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My cardio test showed me to have a high heart-rate, but I did it right after I did 35 push-ups and 60 sit-ups. (There was someone else going at the same time, so I had to do the strength bit first where you do as many of each as you can in a minute.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bit I really wanted to find out was my body composition. I&apos;m 30lbs of fat and 165lbs of other stuff. That&apos;s 15% which is a little better than I expected it to be. My goals are fourfold in this new gym bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10% body fat (That&apos;s about there the abbies start showing up in guys. It&apos;s around 14% in women.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bench press 195lbs (That&apos;s what I weigh and it seems like I ought to be able to bench myself.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;curl 100lbs 15 times (That&apos;s what McK weighs and I want to be able to throw her if she continues to sass me.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;touch my toes (Because I&apos;m twenty-fucking-seven years old.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</event>

				<body>Curls are really crappy exercises.  Why not set goals for yourself on the squat and deadlift?  Those along with the benchpress are the three foundational exercises for building functional strength.  </body>

			<subject>House Hunting</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I got an email from my landlord a couple days ago telling me my rent was late and that I owed him a $25 late fee. At first I kicked myself for having forgotten to pay my rent then I remembered that I hadn&apos;t. Not only had I told my &lt;a href=&quot;http://bbt.com&quot;&gt;shitty bank&lt;/a&gt; to send him a check, I had seen it in the mail at the house. I went online and verified that the check wasn&apos;t a figment of my imagination. Sure enough there was a $650 debit on my account July 31&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align: top; font-size: 75%&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I emailed the bank and asked them exactly what I could do. The thing is I know the check arrived at the house. Someone in the house took it. Well, actually my landlord has had people wandering through continually for the last month trying to fill rooms. I suppose anyone could have taken it. I just need to get out of that damned flop house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went today to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://local.google.com/?q=119+13th+St+SE+20003&quot;&gt;a place about ten blocks&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://local.google.com/?q=236+Massachusetts+Ave+NE+20002&quot;&gt;my office&lt;/a&gt; (I currently &lt;a href=&quot;http://local.google.com/?q=213+F+St+NE+20002&quot;&gt;live two blocks away&lt;/a&gt;). The cool bit is there are two big ol&apos; golder retrievers who live there. I really like real dogs and not the creepy overgrown rats that are all the rage with these sissified city-slickers. The main issue is the commute. A whole fifteen minutes of walking to get to work. I dunno if I can take that. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>Can you get a copy of the cancelled check?  Wachovia makes them available online; perhaps BBT does so as well?

If your landlord is a decent guy that will be proof that you sent the check in good faith.  He&apos;d probably also help you find whoever cashed it.

OTOH, maybe he cashed it himself and is just trying to screw you for late fees.</body>

				<subject>fees</subject>
				<body>I&apos;m not worried about late fees as much as I&apos;m worried he cashed it and is going to try and get another out of me. I don&apos;t really know what I can do in this sitiuation. I&apos;m hoping the bank will have some sort of recourse.

Damned primitive technology. I&apos;ve got a 401K, an IRA, a savings account, Paypal and my regular bank account online and there&apos;s no way for me to get my rent to my landlord except having a check sent (I don&apos;t own a checkbook, this is the only check I have to write) or getting a fistfull of cash from bank.

The thing that bothers me the most is I&apos;m really not certain that he&apos;s not scamming me for the full $650. If he is just lying about never haven recieved the check, what can I do?</body>

				<subject>Re: fees</subject>
				<body>*Someone* had to cash it.  If you suspect fraud, report it to the bank.  They may well credit it back to your account, eat the $650, and start their own fraud investigation.  Especially since they can trace the account the money was eventually deposited into (unless, of course, it was taken out in cash).</body>

			<event>I don&apos;t own a checkbook. I didn&apos;t get one because I was moving when I opened my bank account and I didn&apos;t know what my address would be. Since being here the only check I&apos;ve had to write was the one for my rent. I&apos;ve been doing that through my bank&apos;s online bill-pay.

I&apos;ve been contemplating what to do about the check my landlord said he never received and was searching the internet. I ran across &lt;a href=&quot;http://personal.ecu.edu/wuenschk/StolenChecks.htm&quot;&gt;a lovely story&lt;/a&gt; of a guy who had his checkbook stolen and the twenty or so businesses where his checks were subsequently forged and accepted without ID. I&apos;ve been trying to find something on if you had an already completed check stolen, but I am having trouble with the huge number of results for stolen checkbooks. One of my favorites is for this woman who was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,157563,00.html&quot;&gt;paid with her own check&lt;/a&gt;.</event>

			<subject>Weekend</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve not been posting much as of late because my life has settled into an entertaining, but not terribly interesting routine. I work, go to the gym, party and sleep. That just about covers it. No new harrowing adventures to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last weekend was more of the same, but it was fun and I&apos;ve got pictures, so I thought I&apos;d write about it a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a relatively recent arrival on the drunkard scene it has taken a concerted effort to achieve the amount of humiliation that I have in my short career. There are a few intricacies left to explore however. One of them being the staple of college binge drinking: the keg stand. As Friday was Kevin&apos;s birthday, there seemed no better time to cross that off my list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d never purchased a keg before. A little bit of research led me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metroiceandbeverage.com&quot;&gt;Metro Ice&lt;/a&gt; here in DC. The costs associated with a keg are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yuengling.com&quot;&gt;Yuengling&lt;/a&gt; Keg &amp;bull; $80 (+$10 deposit)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap Rental &amp;bull; $5 (+$50 deposit)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tub Rental &amp;bull; $3 (+$20 deposit)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;120lbs Ice &amp;bull; $18&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all told, about $110 for 15.5 gallons of beer. At eight pints to the gallon that&apos;s about $600 worth of beer in a bar. Even with people bringing bottles it was still half price. A keg of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.killians.com&quot;&gt;Killians&lt;/a&gt;, which is a better beer, was the same price, but they were sold out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party went well, I got to DJ which was fun. There were impromptu speeches, my favorite of which was likely Kevin&apos;s impassioned reenactment of the final battle in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112573/&quot;&gt;Braveheart&lt;/a&gt; though Marc&apos;s reading from Malcom X in a Samuel L. Jackson voice was a close second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did get to stand on my keg, as did everyone else there that night:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.himinbi.org/731559002206_0_BG.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;standing&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about keg standing isn&apos;t the beer, it is the not breathing while standing on your head. This made me a little grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.himinbi.org/713059002206_0_BG.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;grumpy Will&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights included a near deathmatch and K and I being seen on the same stage dancing to Get Low for the first time ever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday was mostly devoted to recuperating until the evening when I headed out with McK to her friends&apos; for a birthday party. We went to dinner and then to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://comedyindc.com/blueshow.htm&quot;&gt;The Blue Show&lt;/a&gt;. This is the fourth improv group that I&apos;ve been to see in DC and it was hands-down the best. It was a more adult show and though not completely vulgar, it definitely didn&apos;t strive to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterward we played some games and did some more drinking. It was here that I learned that, having alcoholics for friends has both developed and kept me from realizing a high tolerance. I tried to teach the group Celebrity but the game was called on account of one team passing out.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Well, my internet is busted. Specifically, I think the WiFi access point of &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiefeed.com&quot;&gt;the guy I sublet from&lt;/a&gt; is defunct. So, to wile away my internetless hours I&apos;ve been learning how to get into my neighbors&apos; networks. The process is pretty simple. A little bit of terminology first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with wired ethernet sniffing, you know the term &lt;em&gt;promiscuous mode&lt;/em&gt;. An ethernet is like a room full of people all shouting at the same time and your computer just ignores anything not specifically destined for it. When you go into promiscuous mode you start listening to anything happening on the line. If people are sending passwords and whatnot without using encryption, you can just read them out of the traffic. (So I&apos;ve heard. I&apos;d certainly not know if any of my English teachers back in college had the password &quot;60retire&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, a wireless network has the concept of promiscuous mode as well. It isn&apos;t what you want though. Promiscuous mode will give you information about all the computers connected to the network with the access point that you are using. What is interesting in this situation is all the computers that are broadcasting, but which aren&apos;t on your network. To get those packets, you need to go into &lt;em&gt;monitor mode&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 802.11 protocol allows for sending out probe requests to which an access point in broadcast mode will respond. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stumbler.net&quot;&gt;Netstumber&lt;/a&gt; uses this method to detect networks. This is mostly useful in wardriving when you&apos;re not going to be around long enough for an actual broadcast. Since I&apos;m sitting in one place, I don&apos;t really need that. Another advantage is that some access points aren&apos;t in broadcast mode and a wireless card in monitor mode will detect those as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My card is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3com.com/products/en_US/detail.jsp?tab=features&amp;sku=3CRDAG675&quot;&gt;3com 3CRDAG675&lt;/a&gt; and I&apos;m using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://madwifi.org&quot;&gt;madwifi&lt;/a&gt; drivers since support isn&apos;t built into the kernel. The drivers aren&apos;t supported by most of the sniffing programs, but all I have to do is put the card in montor mode manually. (This took me a while to figure out, so I&apos;ll note it here. Assuming that the card is already up and running, do:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;wlanconfig ath0 destroy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode mon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;code&gt;ifconfig ath0 up&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I start up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kismetwireless.net&quot;&gt;Kismet&lt;/a&gt; and leave it running. Unfortunately, none of my neighbors seem to be BitTorrent fans, so traffic has been coming in pretty slow. According to an excellent article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=27666&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Wired Equivalent Privacy&quot;&gt;WEP&lt;/acronym&gt; cracking&lt;/a&gt;, I&apos;m going to need about 2gb of traffic. At my current rate, I ought to have that in about three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the analysis being done is statistical, different tools have different rates of success. Kismet dumps all it&apos;s logs in &lt;code&gt;/var/log/kismet&lt;/code&gt; and I&apos;m running &lt;a href=&quot;http://airsnort.shmoo.com&quot;&gt;AirSnort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://aircrack-ng.org&quot;&gt;Aircrack&lt;/a&gt;. From reading a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1814&quot;&gt;comparison of WEP crackers&lt;/a&gt; however, it really looks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://weplab.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;WEPLab&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Columbus</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684818868/qid=1139551982&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lies My Teacher Told Me&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and spent last night learning a little about Columbus. Since tomorrow, October 12, is the anniversary of his landing, I figured I&apos;d share some of what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Columbus first landed on what is now Haiti, there were an estimated 8 million people already living there. Between when he took his first shipful of slaves back to Spain and the end of his self-appointed reign as &quot;viceroy and governor&quot; in 1500, that population had dropped to &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/thistle/www/v9/9.11/1columbus.html&quot;&gt;as few as 100,000&lt;/a&gt;. By 1555, the Indians of the Caribbean Basin were extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Haiti under the Spanish is one of the primary instances of genocide in all human history. Yet only one of the textbooks, &lt;cite&gt;The American Pageant&lt;/cite&gt;, mentions the extermination. None mentions Columbus&apos; role in it. [Loewen, pp. 63-64]&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we take this day off and celebrate this man&apos;s life? Well, perhaps not celebrate, but it is unarguably a part of our history that I think deserves recognition. One of the primary themes of the book is captured well in one of the opening quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;By idolizing those whom we honor, we do a disservice both to them and to ourselves&amp;hellip; We fail to recognize that we could go and do likewise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; margin: 0 2em;&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash; Charles V. Willie&lt;/p&gt;

				<body>What happened in the New World was a tragedy, and, to what extent it was intentional, it was morally wrong. Of course, I believe in absolute moral standards, but we are often hopelessly trapped in our preconceived notions, and I am a little uneasy judging the morality of one age by another&apos;s. For instance, many abolitionists would be horrifyingly racist by today&apos;s standards. Also, I&apos;m pretty sure European diseases killed a lot too(notwithstanding intentional biological warfare, they probably didn&apos;t entirely understand it, and virii have a way of not behaving how you want).

Again, none of this necessarily makes it right. And with regard to Columbus himself, he was one man, his underlings and the deluge of people that followed made the situation the responsibility of many.

And, I still find it all horrifying. For me, one of the take aways from most of the history I&apos;ve read is that any sort of arrogance or assertion of authority over anyone else is the beginning of most crimes against humanity.  That&apos;s why I&apos;m an anarchist :).

			<subject>Bébé</subject>
			<event>I&apos;m working at getting various medical things wrapped up before the end of the year. Today was my trip to the optometrist for new glasses. That whole bit was uneventful up to the dilation at the end. Apparently I&apos;m a really good dilator. Even the doctor commented on how good I was at it. From more than about a foot away you couldn&apos;t see that I had irides at all.

My appointment was in Chinatown, so afterward I went off in search of some food looking like something from &lt;cite&gt;Demonbaby Goes to Washington&lt;/cite&gt;.



&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid;&quot; src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=21&amp;g2_serialNumber=1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waitress seemed friendly enough. Apparently she hadn&apos;t seen &lt;cite&gt;Demonbaby&lt;/cite&gt; or she would have certainly been more disconcerted since, as we all know, Demonbaby eats his server after enjoying some tasty lo-mein. Though I couldn&apos;t really see anything at that point. I attributed her soft-spoken speech to being Asian, perhaps it was abject terror.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

you like kind of scary in this photo... maybe it&apos;s time for a hair cut.(?)

hopefully i&apos;ll see you in a bit more than a month... in DC.  I&apos;m flying back to the US Nov 20.  Right now I am in France.

			<event>The election is fast approaching. I have, unfortunately, found that it takes about a month to get an absentee ballot, so my voice will remain unheard this year.

Things have been heating up here in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpp.org&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;. There&apos;s lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdmedicalmarijuana.org&quot;&gt;ads&lt;/a&gt; and whatnot. It is going to be an interesting election, though things look bad for several of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpp.org/election2006&quot;&gt;initiatives&lt;/a&gt;.

90% of my time has been sunk into learning &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trixbox.org&quot;&gt;Trixbox&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Asteisk@Home). We were getting line errors and dropped calls on our &lt;acronym title=&quot;Primary Rate Interface&quot;&gt;PRI&lt;/acronym&gt; line from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xo.com&quot;&gt;XO&lt;/a&gt;, so it was decided to drop them. The problem is the guy who knows how all this works isn&apos;t here. So far as Linux admin experience, I&apos;m the best they&apos;ve got.

Not to say that I&apos;m a bad admin. I&apos;ve been running Linux as my only &lt;acronym title=&quot;Operating System&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/acronym&gt; for about two years   now and I like it. The issue at hand is I know diddly about &lt;acronym title=&quot;Voice Over Internet Protocol&quot;&gt;VoIP&lt;/acronym&gt;.

It has been an instructional week. I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asterisk.org&quot;&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt; in general and would definitely like a chance to roll out an installation (though with a slightly longer timeline). I&apos;ve felt very professional calling techs all over the place and working to get things set up. It was sort of anti-climactic today when the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verizon.com&quot;&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; tech and I finally got things going and when I asked him what he did and he said, &quot;everything just needed to be rebooted.&quot; Apparently that works in the telecom world as well.</event>

				<subject>Rebooting and Erlang..</subject>
				<body>That&apos;s actually pretty interesting, since the language Erlang came out of the Telecom world. In Erlang &quot;The Standard Way of Dealing with Errors&quot; is to have a process(on a separate computer) watch the process in question. If the process hits an error, it dies. The watching process determines the cause and and fixes the &quot;error condition&quot; and then restarts the process on the other machine.

Apparently, it works quite well. (Yeah, there is a &quot;reductio ad infinitum&quot; here, summed up by the question, &quot;Who watches the watchers&quot;... I guess we&apos;ll go with the famous response Feynmann got about the Hindu creation myth, &quot;It&apos;s turtles all the way down&quot;. :) ).

			<subject>Don&apos;t Mess Up</subject>
			<event>I&apos;ve been screwing with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/livejournal_layout/livejournal_s2_curvy.layout&quot;&gt;livejournal layout&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;m about 75% of the way through, but I generally am liking &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivankara.livejournal.com&quot;&gt;how it looks&lt;/a&gt;.

I&apos;m still contemplating on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivankara.livejournal.com/friends/&quot;&gt;friends page&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/livejournal_layout/borders.phps&quot;&gt;little script&lt;/a&gt; that creates a &lt;acronym title=&quot;Scaleable Vector Graphic&quot;&gt;SVG&lt;/acronym&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/livejournal_layout/cache/&quot;&gt;rasterizes it&lt;/a&gt;. It makes pretty curvy corners, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreamhost.com&quot;&gt;Dreamhost&lt;/a&gt; is slow enough that some of the corners time out. It makes things kinda ugly.

One of the bigger problems at this point is I&apos;ve deleted the &lt;code&gt;edit&lt;/code&gt; button from the post page so if I screw up there&apos;s no fixing it. Here&apos;s to being carefull.</event>

			<event>Geek vocabulary term for the day: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing&quot;&gt;spear phishing&lt;/a&gt;. Regular phishing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ie7.com&quot;&gt;Firefox 2&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s spell check knows the word &quot;phishing&quot;) are those random fake emails telling you your &lt;a href=&quot;http://paypalsucks.com&quot;&gt;Paypal&lt;/a&gt; account needs verifying. It is just someone trying to trick you into installing something.

Spear phishing for example is the people at Dekalb Medical Center who got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110106-spam-spear-phishing.html&quot;&gt;forged e-mail from their human resources&lt;/a&gt; telling them  they&apos;d been laid off. The link that they clicked on then installed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyloggers&quot;&gt;keylogger&lt;/a&gt; to capture their password.

I remember reading about a third type that I can&apos;t find a reference for now. It was called something like &quot;laser phishing&quot; which would be something like a forged e-mail from my boss with a malicious attachment. I suppose at that point though it isn&apos;t phishing so much as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(computer_security)&quot;&gt;social engineering&lt;/a&gt;.

Can you imagine a world where scammers have org charts or friendship graphs? I bet if you had something like like Google&apos;s cache you could start to reconstruct the relationships between people with the links on sites like MySpace and LiveJournal. Then you match those identities to email addresses and you have the backing for some really well tailored phishing.</event>

			<event>We can&apos;t get XO to release our number to Verizon for another month. So, we were just going to get a remote call forward put on the XO lines over to the Verizon lines. Today though we learn that you can only get a temporary call forward put on your XO line if you go through a reseller, which we don&apos;t. The only thing they&apos;ll do is a permanent call forward which takes fifteen days.

Unless the line is down. In that case they will to an emergency temporary call forward. That would likely mean something happening to physical copper coming up from the basement that I watched them screwing around with a couple months ago. It would be very unfortunate is something happened to those lines&amp;hellip;</event>

			<subject>Voting</subject>
			<event>I, unfortunately, will not vote this year. My absentee ballot was sent to Africa and I didn&apos;t have time to get a new one. It sucks since I would like to cancel out my father&apos;s vote on Tennessee&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://realmarriage.org/amendment.html&quot;&gt;marriage amendment&lt;/a&gt;. He&apos;s been on a speaking tour across the state for the last week trying to drum up support as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://realmarriage.org&quot;&gt;Real Marriage bus tour&lt;/a&gt;.

I really don&apos;t get it. Exactly what the do they thing is going to happen if gay people were to marry?

I always thought that homophobia was something along the lines of the racism of the 60&apos;s. I&apos;m certainly not going to argue that racism is dead, but if I were black I wouldn&apos;t expect to walk into a restaurant in most of the country and be refused service. While the problem hasn&apos;t gone away, I think that it is undeniably improving.

My grandmothers, both of whom I love and respect, have both said things that are a little bit racist. I don&apos;t argue with them or expect them to change their sentiments. They are members of their generation and I find it difficult to fault them that when my predilections line up so much with my own generation. It is rare that someone really breaks away from the opinions they grew up with in any serious way and those who do seem more likely to be demented than visionary.

Honestly, I figured this was a problem that I could mostly ignore for a while and it would pass away (literally).

&lt;lj user=&quot;titivillus&quot;&gt; sent me a list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/ballot.measures/&quot;&gt;ballot initiatives&lt;/a&gt; and it looks like eight states (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin) have same-sex marriage bans under consideration.

One of the big problems with the liberal microcosm I travel in is I lose touch with the rest of the world. It is like being overseas in an Islamic republic during the last presidential election. It was completely baffling (and embarrassing) when Bush was reelected. He was so disliked by so many of my daily contacts that I forgot that the country full of people who elected him in the first place were still there.

What are things like for the rest of you? I live with a gay guy and I spent about an hour getting chatted up by a transvestite on Halloween. Different sexualities are certainly present in my daily life, but not in an uncomfortable sort of way. I live in DC though. I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2006/10/24/VI2006102400655.html&quot;&gt;drag races&lt;/a&gt; and spent an hour dancing and drunken cat-calling drag queens with about 10,000 other people. (&lt;em&gt;At some point everyone should see a 200lb man sprint in high heels.&lt;/em&gt;)</event>

				<subject>About that vote...</subject>
				<body>While I believe that every vote counts... your attempt to cancel your dad would have been somewhat futile. We passed the Ban here in TN with the biggest margin of any of the states I think(At least, right now...)

Of course, I&apos;m pretty sure tomorrow the lawsuit to get it declared unconstitutional(US not state) will be filed. I&apos;m also pretty sure that at least one of these amendments, if not all will get struck down.

For the record(I know you know this...), while I have issues with homosexuality, I have even more issues with government intrusion into daily/personal life. And I resent the manipulation I believe this represents too(sowing hate to get votes). While I have issues with homosexuality most of them represent the sort of casual moral disagreement I seem to have with nearly everyone (I mean, I&apos;m against premarital sex too, but so what? Its not really civilized to attempt to manipulate society into stoning you for it).

As far as being in &quot;reality distortion bubbles&quot;, I find myself pretty isolated, but a lot of it stems from being aware. I think a lot of people see the surface level of these debates, spend about 30 seconds on them, and then go on, never thinking that they are being manipulated. I also know people who are Yellow-Dog Republican/Democrats(i.e. you could put a yellow dog on the ballot and label it R or D and they would still vote down party lines...). I guess that comes off as arrogant, but I dunno. I&apos;m with the founders(Washington, et. al.) who felt that political parties were bad mojo and had no place in our system.

I&apos;m disgusted with the whole thing. This election was Against Republicans not For Democrats(what exactly is the vision they have expressed? &quot;Ooh, my turn at the feeding trough/paige molesting/power orgy!&quot;). Tomorrow I expect to hear about their &quot;Mandate&quot; to do something, somewhere. Maybe withdrawing from Iraq in 10 years instead of 20, and perhaps a mild suggestion that we label Bush &quot;naughty&quot; instead of impeaching him for war crimes.

As to the 200 pound man sprinting in high heels, I will have to disagree. I think I can live my whole life and be quite fulfilled without that one...</body>

The only group of people who were more likely to vote against the ban than for it are those who never go to church. Go Jesus.</event>

			<subject>Meats!</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, in early celebration of my birthday several of us went out to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fogodechao.com&quot;&gt;Fogo de Chão&lt;/a&gt;. It was sumptuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea for the restaurant is there are men wandering the floor at all times bearing skewers of freshly fire seared meats. They purport to have fifteen different sorts, but the ones I saw were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filet Mignon - tenderloin wrapped in bacon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Costela - beef ribs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Costela de Porco - pork ribs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linguica - pork sausages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beef Ancho - prime rib&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alcatra - top sirloin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fraldilnha - bottom sirloin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cordeiro - leg of lamb&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frango - chicken wrapped in bacon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Picanha - sirloin seasoned with sea salt and garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a little colored disc by your plate and you just flip it from red to green to send gauchos descending upon you to whack off a tasty chunk of meat. It was so good. The meats were wonderfully seasoned and so soft that I didn&apos;t so much cut them as have them fall to pieces when I tried to cut them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s also a huge salad bar, but I didn&apos;t go to it until I&apos;d already eaten about three platefuls of meat. There were some cheeses and whatnot, but few things that seemed worthy of depriving stomach space to more delectable meat. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also at the table there were cheesy mashed potatoes and some sort of little bread puff filled with cheese and fried plantains. The whole experience was amazing and I am really thankful to my friends for doing it with me.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>DC Life</subject>
			<event>I&apos;ve been wandering our nation&apos;s capitol for almost a year now. I&apos;ve gone to some of the museums and monuments, and I&apos;ve definitely seen my share of bars and restaurants. Last Tuesday, I got to take part in another part of the DC life: the political rally.

My evening began rolling sushi at a little &lt;acronym title=&quot;Marijuana Policy Project&quot;&gt;MPP&lt;/acronym&gt; get-together. It is definitely the way to go with sushi. Normally I get five or six yummy little rolls and they are all too soon gone. When you are rolling your own you can stick all kinds of treats in them and make mounds of sushi.

It was interesting because I was talking to someone about food and started going on about how excited I was for my upcoming lunch at Fogo de Chão. I went on for a couple minutes about how amazing fifteen different types of flame seared meats was going to be before I realized it had gotten quieter. It was then that I remembered that I work for the weed people. In the room of twenty people I was one of three omnivores. It was all good though since that left more of the salmon and cream cheese for me which was so delicious as to nearly cause me to lose control of my bodily functions.

From the MPP party, I headed over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dccc.org&quot;&gt;Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&lt;/a&gt; party. McK scored us tickets through a friend and it was a sight to behold. Just walking through the door the smell of politics was thick in the air. There were lots of important people milling about and even more people looking to make their acquaintance. The schmoozing was thick enough to cut it with a knife.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://the-archange1.livejournal.com&quot;&gt;My creative team&lt;/a&gt; is still working on our business cards and I was already a bit lit, so I wasn&apos;t looking to get my schmooze on. I just enjoyed the live band, open bars and hollering whenever a new seat would be called for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democrats.org&quot;&gt;Dems&lt;/a&gt;. I doubt that I could have spent the evening with a happier bunch of people. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.house.gov/pelosi/&quot;&gt;Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; got up to give her speech people I saw people crying.

It was a really fun evening and I got a cute little donkey pin for my lapel.

Things at MPP were a little less jubilant the next day. They lost both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdmedicalmarijuana.org&quot;&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regulatemarijuana.org&quot;&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; campaigns. It was unfortunate. We knew things were going to be close, but I&apos;d hoped that things would work out. There were a variety of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpp.org/election2006/&quot;&gt;local initiatives&lt;/a&gt; that passed. It&apos;s something at least.</event>

			<subject>Statement of Purpose</subject>
			<event>I&apos;ve been trying to write my statement of purpose for a month now. Grad school feels right to me. That is why I want to go. Putting words to that in an expressive essay is proving difficult.

After all these weeks of wordlessness, I decided to try a new tact. My family is in Hilton Head for Thanksgiving and we&apos;re staying in a pimp palace thanks to my dad. A pimp palace complete with jacuzzi tub.

Tonight I decided to luxury that essay out of myself. So, jacuzzi, candles, Bailey&apos;s and I all got together for a sit-down. That little spark which I figured would ignite this pile of pleasures, I stole from my brother.

I cannot describe to you the rushing tingle the cascaded through my body as I first touched that pristine water. It was heaven and only enfolded my deeper as I sank into the tub.

Unfortunately the stillness of the tub seemed to incite a like stillness in my brain. I could feel myself slipping into mindlessness. Not a bad place to be, but a bad place to try and find a statement of purpose. The whiskey and cream was certainly not helping either. Hoping to offset these ill effects, I turned on the jets.

Immediately, fountains of water sprang to life covering my resting head in frothing foam. I could see, as I arose spitting, that this was an environment poorly suited for writing statements of purpose.

It was invigorating though and woke me right up. I have been using alternating periods of quiet and fervor to keep me going. To date I have produced this account of my pursuit of a statement of purpose.

Statement of purpose still forthcoming.</event>

			<subject>Daddy Dearest</subject>
			<event>I spent a week with my dad over Thanksgiving and while doing so we conflicted over moral issues in a way that we haven&apos;t in quite a while.

Right before the last election he went on a bus tour around Tennessee as the author of the gay-marriage ban that passed almost ten years ago. He spoke about his previous work as a child psychologist and how he helped to cure abused children of their homosexuality. All in all his stumping wasn&apos;t really necessary since amending Tennessee&apos;s constitution to disallow homosexual unions passed with the strongest support of any state in the union: four out of five Tennesseans voted for it.

I talked to him some and told him essentially that I thought he was a hateful bigot. I drew frequent parallels to censures taken against the black population fifty years ago, but I was working at a disadvantage. This is a big issue for him, and he might be bigoted but he&apos;s not dumb. He knows more about the studies than I do and I really like having the majority of the facts before attempting to discuss something.

Part of the issue is that this is a matter of faith for me. Not faith in God, but faith in myself and the clarity of my perceptions. I know some pretty neurotic and emotionally damaged people, and I have gay friends who seem mentally sound to me. Either I&apos;m correct and they&apos;re of sound mind or I&apos;m wrong and homosexuality is a purely psychological issue with no biological component. I trust my perceptions.

Today I got an email from my dad with a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfaf.org/aidsinfo/statistics/transmission.html&quot;&gt;San Francisco Aids Foundation&lt;/a&gt; on transmission rates. It shows from 1981 to the present 89% of HIV transmission in San Francisco has been from male homosexual contact. 1% has been from heterosexual contact. It included a little note saying, &quot;Let your friend know that his sexual life style is a dangerous one.&quot;

His premise is a bit flawed since the heavy infection rates among homosexual men in the early years of the epidemic skews the numbers. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/basic.htm#exposure&quot;&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; about 60% of sexual transmission cases in 2004 involved male homosexual contact.

Something I was wondering about in responding to him though was good counter examples. Ideally, I&apos;d like one where a lifestyle choice my father would think is positive put a person for a natural environmental risk. Christianity and Judaism would be good examples except Romans and Nazis aren&apos;t really natural environmental features. Buddhist or Hindu vegetarians and malnutrition are also a possibility, but I think he&apos;d respond better to an example with more white people. Any ideas?</event>

				<subject>Lifestyle... choice?</subject>
				<body>  WilliaM:
    Why do you want to know about lifestyle choices that your father would think positive but puts it practitioner in a natural environmental risk in the context of a debate on homosexuality?
  It is my belief, and judging from the evidence that I see, that homosexuality is partially a genetic factor and also probably a factor arising from a male fetus&apos; exposure to imbalanced hormones (from the mother) during pregnancy.  As far as female homosexuality, there is strong evidence likewise - did you know that the middle and/or inner ear of lesbians have unique abberations in their formation?
  Anyway, I don&apos;t know about this &apos;lifestyle choice&apos; business.  However, if you want to know about lifestyle choices that your father may think positive but puts a person at a natural, environmental risk, try: drinking likker; moving to the &apos;burbs in an old flood plain, or, relaxed zoning laws; consumption of large amounts of meat (and, don&apos;t get me wrong, but meat in our industrial food system really does carry risk); driving on the public roads; being male.  The list goes on.  The problem is: I don&apos;t know your father and I don&apos;t know what he might consider positive.
  The last item on this list, being male, is obviously genetically driven in human beings.  However, male lifespan is shorter than average, we are more prone to dieing violently; we are more prone to diseases and a whole host of other maladies, and we are not as intelligent or tough as the average human.  Is this God&apos;s retribution against males, since we are more prone to aggression, promiscuity, and greed?  Ask your father.  Perhaps Tennesssee should ban the production of male offspring.

				<subject>Idea for argument</subject>
				<body>Christian missionaries to third world countries.  They have little if no access to medical facilites, and many environmental risk factors such as diseases they would not have been exposed to in the states, and unusual insects, and animals.  Check on the stats for peace corps workers too.  You will find that many of them, espcially women, end up in really bad shape when they are sent into a new natural environment.</body>

			<subject>Life and Times</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Last June, &lt;lj user=&quot;get_brett&quot;&gt;, facing the eventual end of his work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://gearsofwar.com&quot;&gt;Gears of War&lt;/a&gt;, resolved to be more dedicated in his work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://get-brett.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;programming projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;lj user=&quot;the_archange1&quot;&gt;, &lt;lj user=&quot;titivillus&quot;&gt; and myself he tabled the proposition of a productivity list where, sort of like a dieting support group, we would send regular status reports about our various projects. We gave it a shot and though weekly updates didn&apos;t happen, there have been a couple hundred messages between the four of us over the last six months. Though the accountability isn&apos;t all that strong, it has definitely been nice having people to send stuff to when I make progress on something and am proud of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last week we all revisited our project list from when the list started and covered where exactly we were on various things. I&apos;m generally a spaz with the attention span of a ferret on crack and it was actually nice for me to look at something and see that though I do suck horribly at accomplishing things, I have actually made some progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; padding-left: 1em; border-left: 2px solid gray;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://himinbi.org&quot;&gt;himinbi.org&lt;/a&gt;: I want a nice looking portfolio site to show off the fact that I know my ass from a hole in the ground. It may or may not be responsible for helping me land a job, but it is sure as shit not going to to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This site looks identical to how it did when I wrote this. Wayne and I did register &lt;a href=&quot;http://madstones.com&quot;&gt;madstones.com&lt;/a&gt; and his logo work has been going promisingly. The next bit for this one I am doing for work: &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/filmstrip/&quot;&gt;odin.himinbi.org/filmstrip/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; padding-left: 1em; border-left: 2px solid gray;&quot;&gt;Getting Schooled: I want to at least get my masters and, if I can get into a good program, my Ph.D. I&apos;ve got the problem right now of a strong interest in electronics, but insufficient experience to know if it is something I seriously want to pursue professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the parts for this project and wrote a little code, but wandered off and forgot much of what I was doing. McK got me a subscription to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nutsvolts.com&quot;&gt;Nuts and Volts&lt;/a&gt; for my birthday and I got a new issue a couple days ago. It inspired me to pick this one back up, but his time I&apos;m writing down the concepts so than when I wander off and come back I can relearn faster. &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/frontpanel/&quot;&gt;odin.himinbi.org/frontpanel/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; padding-left: 1em; border-left: 2px solid gray;&quot;&gt;Stories: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storytellingcenter.com/festival/festival.htm&quot;&gt;National Storytelling Festival&lt;/a&gt; is in Jonesborough the first weekend in October. It is a little expensive to go to the actual festival, but I want to bring some people down, ride the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vacreepertrail.org&quot;&gt;Creeper Trail&lt;/a&gt;, hang out at the cabin, go to Midnight Cabaret and maybe go spelunking. This project only has one real technical component: &lt;a href=&quot;http://riddlecreek.holcomb.info&quot;&gt;riddlecreek.holcomb.info&lt;/a&gt;. I want to use the cabin as a selling point and the site doesn&apos;t really exist currently. This also relates to possibly renting the place in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We did the trip, but I didn&apos;t finish the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; padding-left: 1em; border-left: 2px solid gray;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pcvs.org&quot;&gt;pcvs.org&lt;/a&gt;: There are all sorts of scripts and pages and stuff that I wrote as a volunteer that would be really useful to current volunteers. The problem it was all hand edited XML files and programs I ran. I&apos;d like to migrate this into a CMS and I&apos;ve got an authentication scheme I&apos;d like to see if I could get to actually work. I think that this site would be reasonably popular (50,000+ hits/month) if I could get it working like I want. It is also my testbed for evaluating any &lt;acronym title=&quot;Content Management System&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/acronym&gt;/publishing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the one I did nothing at all on. I want to play with a CMS idea and because of the size of that I&apos;m leaving it until I don&apos;t have a job as a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I did about how I would have guessed I would. I did lots of little bits, flitting from project to project, but not really finishing anything.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t want to post thi little bit of the last one publicly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; padding-left: 1em; border-left: 2px solid gray;&quot;&gt;1001 Good Songs: I have pretty much a DVD&apos;s worth of good songs collected. I&apos;m close to being able to send off copies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided with this one that I wanted  to be able to take music suggestions from people online. I want to use the DVD as the initial draw to drive up traffic and so this project is currently caught up in two places:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cleaning up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://musicbrainz.org&quot;&gt;MusicBrainz&lt;/a&gt; database so I can use it in tagging and to back the site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mixlists.com/database_schema.html&quot;&gt;www.mixlists.com/database_schema.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A tagging library to clean up my 190+ gb music collection: &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/bytewise_ebnf/ebnf_spec.html&quot;&gt;odin.himinbi.org/bytewise_ebnf/ebnf_spec.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I really want to make some lights blink. I think it would be amazingly cool to make little electronic gadgets and everyone knows breadboards and soldering irons are the sexiest bits of geek swag one can lay their hands on. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to break into this world for years now. I started back in college when &lt;a href=&quot;http://dragons-keep.net&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; gave me this USB dohickey that went with his monitor and had a couple buttons for controlling volume and whatnot. I tried writing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/frontpanel/frontpanel.c&quot;&gt;kernel module&lt;/a&gt; to try and interface with it. The thing is, I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s broken. There is some initial setup stuff that it should do when it&apos;s plugged in and I&apos;m getting errors saying it isn&apos;t doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempt #2 was to do the &lt;a href=&quot;http://usbirboy.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;USB-IR-Boy&lt;/a&gt; project. This is just a little sensor to let me control my computer with a TV remote. I&apos;m currently &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.electronics.basics/browse_thread/thread/9e2ef3e16bd1c63a&quot;&gt;stuck&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve got a firmware image for the microcontroller (&amp;mu;), but I can&apos;t get it to transfer.

&lt;p&gt;Part of the issue is that the &amp;mu; I&apos;m using is the HC08 and it is less common in hobbyists&apos; projects than &lt;a href=&quot;http://microchip.com&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Peripheral Interface Controller&quot;&gt;PIC&lt;/acronym&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parallax.com&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Beginner&apos;s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code&quot;&gt;BASIC&lt;/acronym&gt; Stamps&lt;/a&gt;. There&apos;s less support for it and many of the tools I am using are more than five years old (which is pretty old for software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/spgmr08/&quot;&gt;Spgmr08&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/frontpanel/prommer.cleaned.svg&quot;&gt;simple programmer&lt;/a&gt; to try and flash the &amp;mu;. I&apos;m getting nothing and so I&apos;m going to try the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pemicro.com/downloads/download_file.cfm?download_id=90&quot;&gt;PKG08SZ software&lt;/a&gt; for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&apos;t work, I&apos;m thinking I&apos;ll dump the HC08 for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atmel.com&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Advanced Virtual RISC&quot;&gt;AVR&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There&apos;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7289&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;GNU Compiler Collection&quot;&gt;GCC&lt;/acronym&gt; port&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.obdev.at/products/avrusb/&quot;&gt;firmware USB implementation&lt;/a&gt; that look like they would get me most of the way toward building my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocinside.de/go_e.html?http://www.ocinside.de/html/modding/usb_ultra_ir_receiver/usb_ultra_ir_receiver.html&quot;&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt;.  So far as programming, there&apos;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digikey.com/scripts/dksearch/dksus.dll?PName?Name=ATSTK500-ND&quot;&gt;$79&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2735&quot;&gt;starter kit&lt;/a&gt; that looks great to me.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>McCain</subject>
			<event>I was reading the paper the other night and read an opinion piece by &lt;a href=&quot;http://mccain.senate.gov&quot;&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; coming out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?articleId=d15a8c6f-c7d1-4f22-8c65-523f75d30ddf&quot;&gt;support of Bush&apos;s planned surge in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. With McCain as a presidential hopeful in 2008, it seems like aligning himself with the administration&apos;s policies shows an optimism in their success I haven&apos;t seen many other places.

I&apos;m on another list where someone was critiquing the Democrats&apos; position as obstructionist. They said that Bush has a goal and a plan for accomplishing that goal. The Democrats have been doing lots of complaining and the population has been open to that since they are dissatisfied. What are their goals now that they have some ability to enact change?

The image that comes to mind is from a few weeks ago when I was deflating an air mattress. It had a little plastic clip on it that I inadvertently snapped off. I immediately clamped down on the valve, but there was nothing to do. I could keep the air in the thing and I could probably slow how fast the air leaked out, but I&apos;d broken it. There was nothing to do but deal with that fact.

Was Iraq a mistake? It seemed like it when we were ignoring the international community and invading in the vain search for weapons of mass destruction. I really want to support my country. I&apos;ve got a couple friends over there now putting their lives on the line to fight this war. I&apos;ve not ever put my life on line for anything. I want to believe that they&apos;re not taking that risk in vain.

What are they fighting for? To bring stability to the Iraqi government. Are they getting that done? From most of the news I read, no. Will they be able to get it done with another 20,000 troops?

I like the idea of Syria and Iran being involved. They&apos;ve got the cultural connections to deal with this more effectively than we do. They&apos;ve also got a pretty big stake in the civil war developing on their borders.

The last thing I was considering is how the American people would react if we just pulled out. Seems like the biggest effect would potentially be lots of Iraqis dying and some international ill will. We, as a people, haven&apos;t seemed all that concerned about that to date. In the presidential election, I could never see, &quot;you left lots of Iraqis to die&quot; as a politically damaging charge to level against someone.</event>

			<subject>It&apos;s Good to Be King</subject>
			<event>Here&apos;s an interesting exercise&amp;hellip; Go someplace relatively cheap, like a drug store or a gas station, and imagine yourself for a brief period a member of the local royalty and this store a part of your demense. Walk the aisles knowing that you own everything and anything you would like to take is already yours. Being royalty, you are incredibly sexy and you can also eat anything you like without fear of the repercussions.

&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Consume!&quot;&gt;

There&apos;s nothing like the face of a kid that&apos;s been coveting a certain toy when he finally gets his hands on it. There is something primal in the act of having something physical to hold onto that satisfies a want that you have. As we age we learn that it is shallow to get pleasure from the acquisition of material goods. If you&apos;re an intellectual or focus on your spirituality or develop your professional life, you start to focus your values in those places: you respect learning or inner peace or status. Simple materialism gets left behind as an artifact of childhood.

Or, if you&apos;re like me, there&apos;s always a little banker in the back of your head looking at every purchase and telling you that you don&apos;t really need it and to just go on. For company there&apos;s a peppy blonde in spandex telling you that any food you buy will make you fat and every so often she casts a disapproving look as if to say, &quot;I&apos;ll never sleep with you now, pudgy.&quot;

Both the superiority and all the judgment cut into the experience. They add a layer of analysis that keeps you from being that five year old with the latest x-man action figure. There&apos;s some satisfaction there, but it&apos;s muted. At it&apos;s worst, you just buy only what you need mechanically, letting the little banker and the little woman and whatever friends they have drive everything you do.

Screw that. Having and buying is fun. Enjoy it.

I went to a reunion recently where I hung out with some friends from college who were very focused on intellectualism and spirituality. While I was there, someone told me they heard that I&apos;d become a hedonist. It was an interesting charge to counter. In the end I rationalized it a bit saying that I had always really wondered how the cool kids live. Saying, &quot;Partying all the time? That doesn&apos;t really interest me.&quot; can be done from two very different places. If you say it and no one would want to go out with you, it takes some of the authenticity out of it. Being able to say it from a position where you have it as an option is very different.

I was quiet and uncomfortable at parties all through college. I could say that the lifestyle didn&apos;t appeal to me, but that wasn&apos;t true. I wanted to know how it worked. I wanted to know how to be cool. There was a little part of my self-esteem that was tied up in being ashamed of being a dork that I could never let go. I had two options. One: learn to accept who I am. Two: change myself. I opted for #2.

It sounds shallow. It sounds like I&apos;m the protagonist in some cheesy &apos;80&apos;s high school movie, abandoning some part of my identity to hang with the cool kids. Eventually I&apos;ll end up cruel and jaded and look back on the genuineness of my former life with longing. It&apos;s not like that though. Being a dork is not who I am any more than being cool is who I am. Hanging out in a bar or going to parties is mostly about learning a set of rules. It is knowing what behavior is appropriate. I no more abandoned some critical part of myself than if I&apos;d gone to cotillion and learned which fork goes where and not to put my elbows on the table.

Who I am is a person who will not be ruled by my fears. I will not be afraid that it is shallow to nearly cream my pants when buying a teddy bear. I will not be afraid that I&apos;m wasting my life when I go out to a bar on Friday night. I will not be afraid that I&apos;m a loser when I tell my friends I want to stay home and code some night. Or rather I will be a little afraid and I will not let it drive me. That is the part of me that I stay true to and the part of me I didn&apos;t sell out when I started partying.

It will change you. I can&apos;t express the level of contentment that I felt sitting in the park eating a box of cookies last night. I bought them without looking at the price or the health information. Doing it and just doing it without analyzing the hell out of it is the difference in watching a sunset with someone you love and watching the same sunset having just learned your dad died. It isn&apos;t just the experience, it is who you are going into the experience that really matters.

Another conversation that I had at the reunion was on spirituality. It was about responsibility. Most spiritual people agree that we have some fundamental connection to other people and a responsibility to do good that arises from that. If you&apos;ve not read the story &quot;Beggars in Spain,&quot; I recommend it. The title comes from one of the characters discussing being in Spain and a homeless person comes to her looking for some money. She is compassionate, so she gives them a dollar. Then another comes and to be fair she gives them one as well. Slowly the awareness of free money spreads through the population and she is mobbed by poor people looking for a handout.

I spent $20 last night on beers. I could have stayed home and written a check to Oxfam for $20 and helped some kid from getting malaria. I&apos;ve been to Africa. I&apos;ve seen the difference that a little change can make. In a very real way I choose last night to let some kid die so I could get crunk. I&apos;m pretty cool with that. Everyone has to make the choice at some point to stop giving and have something for themselves. It brings to mind the quote from Rabbi Hillel: &quot;If I am not for myself, then who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?&quot;

The question then was, &quot;How do you know when you&apos;ve done enough?&quot; How, when I say, &quot;I&apos;m choosing to use this $20 on me and my pleasure rather than trying to help someone else,&quot; do I know that I&apos;m not being shallow and selfish? In short: you don&apos;t. You do the best you can and that&apos;s all you can do. No one else gets to live your life for you. You have to make the calls and you have to live with being the person that you choose to become. No book can tell you how to do it right. No guru can make the wise decisions for you. You&apos;re in charge: welcome to adulthood.

I want to cover a couple of things I am not saying&amp;hellip;

I am not saying that you should be a hedonist. I&apos;m not saying you ought to go out and buy whatever you want because it makes you happy. What I am saying is learn to get all the little decision makers in your head to be quiet once in a while and simply savor the moment. The little guys will drive you both ways. During my brief reign as King of the CVS last night I found that there were several things that I didn&apos;t want. My first impulse was to go mad, like a kid in a candy shop, just wander the aisles filling my arms with whatever random stuff I could lay my hands on. After a while though that impulse passed. It is borne in part on the knowledge that this is a one time thing and I want to cram as much consuming in as I can into the moment. That&apos;s not the nature of the game though. When I settled into really being King and not just King for a Day, the greed faded away. I didn&apos;t need to stuff my face with everything I could lay my hands on. That&apos;d just make me sick and spoil my enjoyment. These things were mine and there was no need to stockpile against scarcity in the future. I eventually picked out only a couple things because honestly there were only a couple things that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted.

I am also not saying that happiness can be bought. Materialism is not a replacement for friends or spirituality or professional standing. All that I&apos;m saying is that cutting away the analysis that is often layered over our experiences makes then cleaner and orders of magnitude more fulfilling. Shopping, for me, is one of those activities where I let a lot of thinking get in the way of experience.

I&apos;m not saying that you should just do whatever you feel like and not think about the consequences. The CVS was a good kingdom for me because, honestly, even if I go crazy, I&apos;m not going to blow more than $50. The point is about learning what it feels like to turn the analysis off. As you get better at it then you learn the separate out the different voices and either choose to do what they say or not. Then, when you do what you&apos;ve decided to do, you can let them go and get into what you&apos;re doing.

Something I think it is important to keep in mind is a paradox brought about by time: you matter simultaneously immensely and not at all.

While I was back in Cookeville, I spent some time with an old friend. She told the story of how she went out with me and some friends in college and while there, she met a guy. Love happened and that guy is now her husband. What if it was me that asked her to come along? What if I&apos;d decided to stay in that night? They could never have met. Someday their granddaughter might be president or cure cancer and that person will exist in a very small way because I existed. Our lives touch so many others in so many ways, and as time plays it out, everything we do alters the tapestry of the world in ways we can&apos;t even imagine.

As you&apos;ve been reading this; children starved to death, women were raped and men killed. Someone risked their live to help someone else, someone stole something and someone met the person they will marry. The world is hugely complex and there is only so much that you can do. If you find yourself getting caught up in the importance of the work you are doing are the sacrifices you are making, know that if you get hit by a bus tomorrow, the world would deal. If you&apos;re like most people, only about a dozen people would really care that you were gone. Know this and relish the freedom that it gives you to experiment with your life.

You&apos;ve got this one little life to live. Trillions or people have tried to live a good life through the course of history. Will you manage to do something that no one ever did before? Probably not really. You can though relish and savor the unique creation that is your personal experience of the world. Try being the King of a CVS and pay attention to those little voices that can get in the way of really living.

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;</event>

			<subject>WTF Mate?</subject>
			<event>I find it interesting that the &lt;acronym title=&quot;Office of National Drug Control Policy&quot;&gt;ONDCP&lt;/acronym&gt; is running a set of ads that I&apos;m pretty sure were produced by someone blazed out of their mind. My favorite is &lt;a href=&quot;http://abovetheinfluence.com/the-ads/default.aspx?home=launchagain&quot;&gt;the one where the stoner guy gets dumped for an alien&lt;/a&gt;.

This new set particularly emphasizes the dangers of being a stoner loser. Start getting high and your respectable friends will be disappointed in you. Eventually you&apos;ll be all alone with only the devil weed to keep you company. I think it is still a strong enough image in our society to use with some effectiveness, but these ads are a really weird way of doing it.

They&apos;re just an interesting change of pace from the &quot;if all you friends jumped off a cliff&quot; tact that the last ones used. Perhaps they simply realized that yes, the average 15 year old would be more than happy to follow their friends off a cliff.

At the reunion in Cookeville I was talking to someone who works with high schoolers and found it really interesting to hear him use the exact same term to describe them that my mom, a high school teacher, has used: &quot;entitlement.&quot;

We&apos;re America. We consume. That&apos;s sort of our thing in the international arena. We consume stuff and get into wars. Well, our kids consume and they don&apos;t even have to go to a job to get what they want. The problem that I&apos;ve heard described by people who work with them is they&apos;re not accustomed to putting forth effort. It is too easy to just keep coasting and doing whatever you feel like until you crash.

I&apos;m fine with drug education, but it needs to be education. Put the 45 year old McDonald&apos;s fry cook on the TV talking about how he spent his teens baked out of his mind and never graduated from high school. Put the &lt;acronym title=&quot;Emergency Medical Technician&quot;&gt;EMT&lt;/acronym&gt; on talking about having to hunt through the bushes to find the severed leg of the drunk dumbass that went over the divider. Put the 30 year old meth head with no teeth and looks 60. Get these people to tell the real stories of the real world and what happens if you don&apos;t get your shit together.

Don&apos;t tell me my dog is going to be disappointed in me. Don&apos;t tell me my girlfriend will leave me for an alien. Don&apos;t even tell me my life will go nowhere. I watch TV. I walk down the street. I know that tons of people with jobs drink and I&apos;m pretty sure some of them get high. Their lives didn&apos;t go to shit, why is mine going to? All that needs to be done is put someone on the screen that people identify with who can give a realistic story explaining how not learning moderation can leave you miserable.

Moderation would be a harder message to sell since teenagers are pretty much retarded.

I was thinking about an argument for my teenager when I, inch&apos;allah, have one someday. We have reduced culpability for crimes for minors. We have special laws governing their behavior. We essentially say that they are not complete people capable of making decisions for themselves. We&apos;ve had lots of second class citizens through the years in America, blacks and women foremost among them. As history progressed, some people from these groups made it into the mainstream and always some stood up and spoke for their downtrodden brethren. Well, with teenagers pretty much everyone makes it into the mainstream and you don&apos;t hear many people clamoring against the plight of the downtrodden teenager. Could this perhaps be because most people recognize that the man was right and they actually were retarded?</event>

			<subject>Am I Racist?</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Back at Tech, I went to hear a researcher from UT talk about gender and society. I don&apos;t remember his name or the subject of the talk, but he opened with an anecdote that I&apos;ve contemplated from time to time over the years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I look out over this crowd and I am reminded of my times back in college. From my gray hair you might guess it&apos;s been a while. I was in college back in the &apos;60&apos;s, and it wasn&apos;t exactly like you see in the movies, but it was something interesting. Many of us felt as though we were part of something special; that the world was changing and we were a part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We used to have groups of people who would get together and just talk about stuff. Sometimes there was a book, but alot of the time the conversation just meandered. I remember being your age and being in one of those discussions about gender. One of my friends turned to a black girl and said, &apos;our struggle as women unifies us. There are lots of different problems with the world, but we can connect in the common ground of our womanhood.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Her friend responded, &apos;No. That&apos;s a nice thought, but when you get up in the morning and look in the mirror you see a woman. When I look in the mirror, I see a &lt;em&gt;black&lt;/em&gt; woman.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was at that point I realized that when I get up in the morning and look into the mirror, I see a &lt;em&gt;human being&lt;/em&gt;. The thing about privilege is that it&apos;s invisible. Everyone else has to define themselves in relation to it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been thinking about this in the last couple days because I&apos;ve been arguing social issues with McK and one of her central points of opposition to my points is that I am a passive racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other night on my way to the gym, there were hundreds of high school and middle school kids toting pro-life signs milling around Union Station. (I assume they were on their way back from the Capitol.) As McK and I were coming home, we were admiring their discarded placards. She was fascinated that one of the main groups was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kofc.org&quot;&gt;Kights of Columbus&lt;/a&gt;, who are apparently a white-supremacist group. The idea of white-supremacists going on about abortion reminded me of the recent move to reinstate the &lt;acronym title=&quot;Federal Communication Commission&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/acronym&gt;&apos;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=333927&quot;&gt;fairness doctrine&lt;/a&gt;&quot; requiring &quot;all coverage of controversial issues by a broadcast station be balanced and fair.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what used to give all candidates in elections equal air-time. I&apos;m for an informed populace, but I&apos;m more against direct governmental interference in media content. So, I said that I was against censorship so long as people are held accountable for the effects of deliberate mistruth and slander. After some chit-chat, McK&apos;s response was, &quot;I&apos;m doing better, I didn&apos;t bring up how your position might be different if you weren&apos;t a college educated white male.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does one respond to that? I&apos;m not going to claim racism doesn&apos;t exist. I can&apos;t really say that I&apos;d have the same perspective if I was a black woman; I have no clue. I have friends of different races, but they are all pretty well acculturated middle class Americans. Do I know what life is like in the ghetto? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I don&apos;t really have any response to the accusation that I&apos;m racially insensitive. I generally don&apos;t think about race when talking to someone. I talk to everyone in basically the same way. Is that wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m generally very proud of my life and I love my friends. It feels so strange to me to be ashamed that my best friends are white. The unspoken accusation is that I&apos;m comfortable enjoying a status quo built on the use and abuse of other people. People are being discriminated against all over the place and, cocooned and oblivious in my little white world, I take positions on issues that serve to exacerbate the issues and make these people&apos;s lives worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the places I really get caught up is on the issue of identity. Everyone is looking around for things to build an identity out of. I&apos;m a Southerner. I&apos;m a computer geek. I&apos;m a drinker. I&apos;m a dancer. I&apos;m a writer. As much as these are things that I do, these are things that paint a picture of the person I want to be. This isn&apos;t about the insecure high schooler smoking to fit in with the cool kids. This is about everyone having a person inside that they are and wanting to understand who that person is and wanting to express that person to the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs an identity and I see where people frequently use their race to draw upon for parts of their identity. I know Asian people who like eating with chopsticks, black people who wear &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fubu.com/mainpage.html&quot;&gt;FuBu&lt;/a&gt; and white 20-somethings that hate Bush. It is about expressing who you are and belonging to a group that you admire. Sometimes people ignore their identity and try to fit in where they don&apos;t belong, but I see fitting in as a healthy activity in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackness, Asianess, intelligence, femaleness or whateverness all have activities and attitudes that are associated with them. There is the trait and then there are the cultures that are associated with the trait. Martha Stewart and Paris Hilton: both women, very different cultures. Lil&apos; Jon and Colin Powell: both black. Me and David Duke: both Southern. My biggest questions at this point are about mobility. McK seems to tie race and culture very closely together. I think what I would like to know more about is how race affects mobility and how that relates to individual decisions about identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole mess is so very complicated&amp;hellip; I&apos;ll have to come back to this one.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>We can&apos;t help our genetics. I recognize that a large-but-unquantifiable amount of luck is why I was born a white middle class male, as opposed to an indigent inhabitant of a third world country.

I don&apos;t feel guilty though. How can I? I mean, its luck. As an extension, I don&apos;t really let other people of different backgrounds make me feel guilty.

My background is fairly similar to yours, so we have a similar problem. One thing that always turned me off to &quot;enlightened, multicultural, &apos;liberal&apos;&quot; viewpoints was that it seemed to require me to develop way more guilt and self immolation about being a WASP than was appropriate.

I hate the inequality in the world today. The sort of hate I see people spewing, the amount of my &quot;success&quot; built on past atrocities bothers me. A minister I talked about this with recommended &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Rich-Christians-Hunger-Ronald-Sider/dp/0849914248&quot;&gt;Rich Christians in an age of Hunger&lt;/a&gt;. One distinction the book makes really clear that I find useful is &quot;structural injustice&quot; vs. &quot;regular injustice&quot;. 

One is a structural problem with our society. In those, we should fight against those problems(for instance, &quot;being a passive racist&quot;), but the problem doesn&apos;t lie in one individual but in society as a whole, and so one individual can&apos;t change it. Hating yourself won&apos;t affect it either. Actually, that &quot;overdeveloped&quot; guilt can actually work against it. Rather than attacking the problem, you wallow in how &quot;horrible&quot; you are for not stopping it.

I agree its complicated and messy. However, I also will not allow someone to undermine my viewpoint with guilt and factors beyond my control. For instance, am I not allowed to talk about extreme poverty since I&apos;ve never gone without?

Yeah, when I look in a mirror, I see a human being. That&apos;s why I fight against racism and gender inequality, and any other sort of injustice, because I have far more in common with other people than a kitten or an amoeba. If the fact that I&apos;m a WASP means my help is rejected by some people, so be it, I can&apos;t help it that they are an asshole.

Also, a word about inequality. There are different kinds of inequality, and some are a fact of life. I&apos;m not a communist either :), maybe I should use a different word, but even if we reset the world tomorrow, some people would end up with different outcomes. That&apos;s the difference between structural vs. non-structural. Some people are just lazy mooches off of society, some people are screwed by circumstances beyond their control. One group needs help, the other needs get a life. You can sort of realize the lame &quot;liberal vs. conservative&quot; debate as being about individual inequality vs. structural inequality.

			<subject>Lear</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;For those in DC, the performance of King Lear by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classicaltheatreofharlem.org&quot;&gt;Classical Theatre of Harlem&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.folger.edu/whatsonsub.cfm?wotypeid=2&quot;&gt;Folger Theatre&lt;/a&gt; is an evening well-spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was only vaguely familiar with the story and André De Shields performance as Lear really helped draw me into the story. It is frequently difficult to deliver Shakespeare without it seeming performed. I thought that De Shields did a good job of effectively conveying emotion into a very complex character. My favorite though was Ty Jones as Edmund. The emotional depth of the character is more limited, but what there was he swam in. I really enjoyed his relish at being bad. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred Pressier&apos;s interpretation of the play was a little non-traditional. The costuming was more Middle Eastern than the little bit I remember from the bits Lawrence Olivier&apos;s performance I saw years ago. The most striking aspect though was the energy and physical presence of the performers. The entire cast moves with a sense of power that I am more accustomed to seeing in Cirque du Soleil than in Shakespeare. The athleticism of the actors was readily apparent as the jumped and climbed and fought their way through the play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that some might be set off by the level of energy and pace of the show. I liked both it and Pressier&apos;s use of a set of moving risers to alter the set through the course of the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also spent some time discussing the &quot;complete misrepresentation&quot; of McK&apos;s views in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivankara.livejournal.com/66508.html&quot;&gt;post yesterday&lt;/a&gt; with her shortly before I went to the play. As such, issues of race were still playing in my mind as I watched this predominantly black troupe. The most prominent white actor was Danny Camiel as the cuckolded and dominated Duke of Albany. I thought it was also interesting that with the deaths of Lear, Regan, Goneril, Cordelia, Cornwall and Gloucester; he will likely be the one to end up owning most everything. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>For Great Justice, Take Off Every Zig</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I sent a few hours this morning wandering around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?id=3491&quot;&gt;United for Peace and Justice&lt;/a&gt; rally and march. It was entertaining to see the varieties of different people that were out in opposition to the war. There were guitar playing hippies that were likely on the Mall 40 years ago protesting Vietnam. Black-clad anarchist teenagers with their faces covered, waving somehow angry looking flags. The hip-hop contingent holding a freestyle competition with an anti-war theme. A troupe of very peppy young girls dressed all in red who danced and sung their way through the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the camera that I recently stole only has it&apos;s default 512mb card, so I wasn&apos;t able to take many pictures. I did get a couple though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;lj-cut text=&quot;Damn the Man&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=8971&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=8973&quot; alt=&quot;Dancers&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding: .5em 1em;&quot;&gt;These were the cheerful dancing ladies in red. I had hoped to see a meeting between them and the 20 or so pro-war demonstrators, but the police had those folks cordoned off. Probably best given the invectives that were being bandied about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://medley.smugmug.com/gallery/2400259#125768548&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://medley.smugmug.com/photos/125768548-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Signage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding: .5em 1em;&quot;&gt;It wouldn&apos;t be a demonstration without signs. I thought mine was entertaining, but nothing like Ben&apos;s &quot;Another Porn Star Against the War&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=8977&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=8979&quot; alt=&quot;Free Hugs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding: .5em 1em;&quot;&gt;Ben availed himself frequently of the free love being offered. This particular fellow visited everyone in our group and saw that we all got a little action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://medley.smugmug.com/gallery/2400259#125768892&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://medley.smugmug.com/photos/125768892-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Crowd&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding: .5em 1em;&quot;&gt;There were quite a few people out, but it was hard to get a sense of the size since they were spread over five or six blocks of the Mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=8992&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=8994&quot; alt=&quot;When the Saints Go Marching&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;border: 2px solid; padding: .5em 1em;&quot;&gt;Once the march around the Capitol started though, you got a sense of the enormity. This is the beginning of the funnel and there were about this many people walking by continually for an hour. The only real number that I&apos;ve seen so far is &quot;less than 100,000.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/lj-cut&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was interesting how everyone was there to join in a common cause, but there were still lots of behaviors to establish an individual identity in the crowd. I liked it because as much as it made it a unified statement to some external group, it was an entertaining spectacle for the folks participating. I also realized a certain reluctance on my part to really join in. I&apos;m still doing a pretty jaded bit. I think it really started to set in with the re-election of Bush. The starving African children and more recent gay-marriage bans have helped keep it in place. Do many of the rest of you feel fundamentally out of touch with the pulse of the American populace? There were lots of people chanting &quot;This is what democracy looks like&quot; today. I wish that I believed that.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Damned Circuits</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I may have figured out why the hell my simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/frontpanel/&quot;&gt;microcontroller project&lt;/a&gt; won&apos;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://usbirboy.sourceforge.net/prommer.png&quot;&gt;this schematic&lt;/a&gt;, the one provided by the project, you&apos;ll note that the serial port driver (the smaller chip) is a MAX232. The capacitors connected to it are 100 nF = 100x10&lt;sup&gt;-9 &lt;/sup&gt;F = 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;F = .1µF. .1µF capacitors are what are used by the MAX232&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. The MAX232 uses 1µF capacitors. I&apos;ve spent many hours trying to get this damn thing to work. If this turns out to be the issue, I don&apos;t know if I am going to be more irritated of relieved. I definitely want to try and replace the &lt;a href=&quot;http://usbirboy.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;existing project&lt;/a&gt; because it has repeatedly not shown the sort of meticulousness I would expect from someone working with electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, I&apos;ve been reminded of a project I have wanted to do for a long time which is take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/giicm/&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Integrated Circuit&quot;&gt;IC Masturbator&lt;/a&gt; and do a semantic capture of the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Masturbator is the pin outs of hundreds of chips, but it is all little &lt;acronym title=&quot;American Standard Code for Information Interchange&quot;&gt;ascii&lt;/acronym&gt; diagrams. I&apos;d like to design an XML chip description language which could be used to drive a better site and generate prettier diagrams and truth tables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;display: block&quot; href=&quot;http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/giicm/driver.html&quot;&gt;http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/giicm/driver.html&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;versus&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;a style=&quot;display: block&quot; href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/frontpanel/max232_dip.svg&quot;&gt;http://odin.himinbi.org/frontpanel/max232_dip.svg&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the popularity of sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://instructables.com&quot;&gt;instructables.com&lt;/a&gt; show a base of interest that would make it worthwhile. The next step would be to use the &lt;acronym title=&quot;Scalable Vector Graphics&quot;&gt;SVG&lt;/acronym&gt;s in a schematic design program because I&apos;ve not used one yet that isn&apos;t crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the issue is time&amp;hellip; Never enough time.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Rep. Bill Jenkins</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I was heating up my lunch in the kitchen at work today and noticed a copy of &lt;em&gt;CQ&apos;s Politics in America: The 108&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Congress&lt;/em&gt;. As I was flipping through, I happened upon the entry for Tennessee&apos;s First District Representative: Bill Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His two pages don&apos;t delve much into his political career as a congressman. His record seems pretty much in tune with the party line. The bulk of the text is concerned with his political history. The paragraph I found the most interesting was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In 1996, Quillen&apos;s retirement after 17 terms unleashed a lot of pent-up political ambition in northeastern Tennessee. Jenkins touted his status as the only farmer among the leading candidates in the huge Republican field, and he claimed to be the only &quot;dyed-in-the-wool, card-carrying, bona fide hillbilly&quot; in the race. Thanks to his many years of political involvement, Jenkins proved to have friends spread across the district. He bested conservative state Senator Jim Holcomb by a narrow 331 votes [out of 80,000+ cast] for the nomination.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember losing that election as one of the most emotionally painful events in my life. You spend months devoting yourself daily to trying to make something happen and then to fail by so small a margin is devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad and I don&apos;t see eye to eye on many political issues. I still wish he had won that race. Part of it is because he is my dad, but it is moreso because he really is one of the best politicians that I know. I&apos;ve never really been around him when he&apos;s doing schmoozing, but I have been around him when you drop him into roomful of strangers. He just talks to people; most of the time he makes friends. It is a characteristic I really admire in him and it would be amazing if I could learn it one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it would have been interesting to see how he would have done in this fast-paced political world. I bet his entry in the &lt;em&gt;108&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Congress&lt;/em&gt; wouldn&apos;t have been 3/4 about how he got in office.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Stories</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I almost got this done last night, but had to run off to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/view/events/rusted_root_2007/&quot;&gt;Rusted Root&lt;/a&gt;. The concert was awesome. The songs are a bit uniform, but they are uniformly kinetic and hypnotic. Especially at the volume right by the stage where I couldn&apos;t understand most of the words, it all felt very primal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m slacking again and not posting. It unfortunately generally happens when I have the most interesting things going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the hulking Cote d&apos;Ivoiriene guy who, within minutes of me meeting him, told me to take my pants off. Not a doctor. Not a rapist. The masseuse who delivered the amazing present McK gave me for our one year anniversary. (Though realizing how good it felt to get a good rubbin&apos; left me reevaluating the value of the massages she gets from me at a minimum of twice weekly. I think maybe I should be getting some cash or something for that level of relaxation.) We also went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gbrowns.com&quot;&gt;Georgia Brown&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; and had a lovely evening eating very expensive southern food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I had an amazing time. I&apos;m pretty sure it is the first time I&apos;ve ever been to a bar by myself as I went to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speakeasydc.org&quot;&gt;Speakeasy DC&lt;/a&gt;. I can&apos;t believe there has been storytelling going on here the whole time I&apos;ve been in DC and I haven&apos;t known about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two featured tellers and then several &quot;open-micers.&quot; The open-mic people only got seven minutes for their stories, so they had to tell fast and tell well. There wasn&apos;t a single teller that didn&apos;t do a really solid job. The language was succinct but colorful; the tones warm and embracing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent out text messages while I was watching because I really wanted to share the experience. My description at the time was, &quot;imagine improv by poets with their lives as material.&quot; The theme for the evening was &quot;Hurts So Good: Stories About the Pain and Pleasure of Romance.&quot; The stories ran the gamut. Ones that I remember are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The girl whose love for her boyfriend drove her to help him achieve his dreams by enrolling them both in scuba diving lessons. Her passion having somehow blinded her to the fact that she neither swam nor enjoyed water at all. So excited was he to get into the dive that he was already under as she puked twice before following him down. Their relationship survived that bump only to come to an end when he enrolled them both in advanced lessons a couple months later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A poetry slam performer who told the story of how he came to know his wife. One of the lines I enjoyed particularly was, &quot;Her ass in that red dress was like the sun setting over the desert. I wanted so badly to ride off into that sunset.&quot; I wish I could manage to suave and lewd simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The City Paper has an &quot;I Saw You&quot; section where you can connect with people you&apos;ve met at random, but didn&apos;t get a number for. One girl told of helping a guy work out something with his cell phone while riding the bus. They meet with the aid of the City Paper, and during their date another girl comes storming in off the street demanding, &quot;What was it? The L2? The B9? The 42?&quot; and turning to the guy starts tearing into him about the bus being &quot;their thing.&quot; He turns to the teller and calmly says, &quot;you don&apos;t need to stay for this.&quot; She didn&apos;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 30-year-old &quot;love virgin&quot; who, after a guy professed his love for her and persisted for a couple months, is convinced of her own love. Not too long thereafter though he retracted his profession, not to end the relationship, but just &quot;to let her know.&quot; Well, once she dumped him, she got a refund for his Christmas gift and spent the money on a spa. She now keeps a breakup fund that gets $100 every month she&apos;s in a relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was one fellow who attempted to tell the story of his childhood camp love, but the sound system was going out. He still gave a good telling of one of the more touching stories, but he seemed a bit flustered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was even a traditional love tale from somewhere in Eastern Europe that told of a pair of rock formations and how they were placed there to immortalize a grandfather, granddaughter, and their love for each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some others, but those are the ones I remember the best. The also had an audience participation bit where people wrote down their stories on note cards and competed for &quot;best deal-breaker,&quot; &quot;most romantic&quot; and &quot;most pathetic.&quot; My favorite was the deal-breaker winner. A fellow is on a first date in New Orleans and Dan Akroyd is in the restaurant. His date was a fan and went over to talk to Dan, sat down at the table, and before the guy leaves, his date is making out with Dan. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Jabbering</subject>
			<event>It&apos;s starting to happen. When I first heard about Jabber years ago, I remember thinking, &quot;An open instant messaging protocol, I bet people would come up with some interesting stuff if this got popular.&quot;

I went off and made myself an account, but no one else used it, so I lost interest. Now, I&apos;m willing to bet that 90% of the people reading this have a Jabber account. Of those, I bet 80% don&apos;t even know it. &amp;#x263A; Are you a livejournal user? If you have an IM client that isn&apos;t crappy, it probably handles Jabber (&lt;a href=&quot;http://gaim.sf.net&quot;&gt;GAIM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/learn/&quot;&gt;Trillian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat/&quot;&gt;iChat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://meebo.com&quot;&gt;Meebo&lt;/a&gt; all do). Just go in and put in your livejournal username and livejournal.com as the server.

That one isn&apos;t all that interesting since no one is logged on. There&apos;s a chatbot that lets you post to your journal (it&apos;s how I&apos;m posting this), but that&apos;s about it.

A more interesting account is if you happen to have to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://gmail.com&quot;&gt;GMail&lt;/a&gt;. When you log in and see the little Contacts list in the sidebar, that is actually a little Jabber client. If you go in and add your GMail account info with talk.google.com as the server, you&apos;ll see your contacts in your IM client and you&apos;ll show up as avaialable for chat through GMail even when you&apos;re not connected. It also logs any of your conversations under Chats which has come in handy for me a couple times already.

For me, my office also runs an in-house Jabber server. We use IM extensively to sort out little issues. It&apos;s also available via the internet over &lt;acronym title=&quot;Secure Sockets Layer&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/acronym&gt;, so across the country lots of little things that would be handled with little phone calls are handled via IM.</event>

Sure, I jumped on a little later, but still...

Actually, I now accidently have three jabber accounts. Gtalk, livejournal, and the original jabber.org account I created.</body>

			<subject>Me and McK</subject>
			<event>It all seems so surreal right now. I&apos;ve been going along with my daily routine. Walking to work, cursing computers, eating lunch&amp;hellip; It all seems so normal, but underneath it all I know something important and fundamental has changed.

It&apos;s over. We&apos;re done.

I&apos;m sad.

I accept this. I think that it is the right thing to happen. It doesn&apos;t change that I will be losing someone I&apos;ve come to love over the course of the last year.

I really want to write down what went wrong because I can already see myself looking back and not understanding why things ended. I want to remember why I thought this was a good idea so that I don&apos;t look back and wonder if I was simply dumb.

The problem is that our lives had two distinctly separate components. There were the times that I went over to her house and we talked and watched Lost and all those sorts of things that lovers do. Those times were great. We were candid and playful and compatible in a variety of ways. She taught me to value intelligence in a girlfriend in a way that I hadn&apos;t before.

Then there were the three or four nights a week I was out with my friends: going to bars, playing pool, partying and whatnot. She doesn&apos;t go out as much as I do. Part of it is an ongoing battle with &lt;acronym title=&quot;Irritable Bowel Syndrome&quot;&gt;IBS&lt;/acronym&gt; and part is simply a difference in personality. When I do go out, it is frequently to house parties and bars where the point is, in large part, drinking, which she doesn&apos;t do. I don&apos;t really fault her that lifestyle, and it has helped me get pretty comfortable dancing by myself, but it is an issue of time.

I would end up trying to balance job and friends and relaxation and relationship, and simply never had enough. I left her feeling neglected, and particularly on special occasions as though I hadn&apos;t done enough to make her feel cared for. On my end, I always had too much to do and even though I was passing on invitations to spend time with her, I always felt like I was disappointing her.

I think couples having different sets of friends is a great thing. I don&apos;t want my life to be consumed by someone else&apos;s or have them as an addition to my own. In the last week though I&apos;ve been to five different events and hung out with probably 30-40 people I knew reasonably well. The number of them that had met McK: probably ten. The number that have seen her in the four dozen times I have been out last two months: maybe one. Lives can be too separate as well.

She said something as we were talking last night that really struck home with me. She said she wishes she had some time to date other people to know whether or not she is taking me for granted. I feel pretty much exactly the same. What we have is really good when we&apos;re together. It is all the logistical niceties of making time and planning events where things fell apart.

She said that maybe once I start grad school my activities won&apos;t be quite so &quot;young&quot; and we&apos;ll run into each other and things might work out better. Maybe she&apos;s right&amp;hellip;</event>

				<subject>Hang in there</subject>
				<body>Will -
Hang in there, you&apos;ll find someone that is compatible with you, and will enjoy hanging out with your friends and would be okay just staying at home too. As long as you each realize what your needs are, keep an open line of communication, and be able to tolerate each other more than just the  &quot;puppy love&quot;. For example, when you can fart and be able to run around in order to share it with your partner....not mention they can laugh and not complain about it. Then you know it&apos;s right.. . just because you may have to fumigate afterwards to get the smell out,. =) 

Think of this as a learning experience, and you&apos;re one step closer to finding that special someone that you will not feel trapped or that your missing out on some big party. And instead of having 2 components to your relationship, you&apos;ll actually have 1. Where you can have a relationship and relax at the same time, or you can pick up and go wherever the mood takes you both. It takes time to build that kind of relationship, and you could also go out on night and meet that special ssomeone at say  O&apos;charley&apos;s then move over to Waffle House when your friends ditch you. After about 10 cups of coffee a piece....it&apos;s got to be right. ==) 

Take care!

			<subject>Babel</subject>
			<event>Things topping a list of activities not to do when going through an emotionally trying period: watch Babel.

It is literally the first time that I have stopped watching a movie because it made me so sad I wanted to go stick my head in the oven.

And the problem is it wasn&apos;t really sad, it was desolate. Usually I like the movies that draw several small stories together spread out across a wider tableau. It gives me a sense of the variety of life and how there are connections all around that you never know about.

Babel was leaving me with a sense of the arbitrality of the world and how it is huge and doesn&apos;t care a whit for my insignificant little life. I felt not like one dancing little spark in an amazing pattern, but like a grain of corn to be ground into nothing by the unthinking stony weight of the world.

I&apos;m trying to take solace in that and see that however bad I feel it will eventually pass away, but Babel was cutting at the underlying belief that whatever it changes to will be better than now. Not all of the stories were sad, but I felt myself waiting for the other shoe to drop in the one that wasn&apos;t and I just couldn&apos;t stand to see it happen.</event>

			<event>&lt;blockquote style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus said to his disciples: &quot;Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Luke 12:22-29&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just sprinting to the office and this verse came to mind. I&apos;m panicking because I went home to check on Chris&apos;s dogs while he&apos;s in Pittsburgh, and I completely forgot that I am supposed to be meeting the electronics recyclers at 12. At the same time under the &quot;oh my God, I&apos;m gonna get fired&quot; there&apos;s a part of me that&apos;s asking, &quot;what&apos;s the last thing that didn&apos;t work out for you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really do feel lucky. I talk about it sometimes how I moved back to the States and I got a job and a girlfriend without really doing anything. I&apos;ve got cool friends and interesting things to do all the time. In many ways I find it unsettling because I feel like I&apos;m sitting on a fortune I didn&apos;t earn. The idea of moving to a new town is intimidating. I recognize the role that chance has played in my life. It is a large part of why I still sometimes give a homeless guy a few bucks because I never really lose that sense of there but for the grace of God go I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read an article about luck one time that was interesting. They took people and gave them a survey where they ranked how lucky they are. Then in a supposedly unrelated activity, they gave them a newspaper and asked them to count the pictures in a timed trial. A couple pages in, there&apos;s a picture of someone holding a sign that says, &quot;there are 31 pictures in this newspaper.&quot; A little while later there&apos;s a larger one that says, &quot;the experiment is over, there are 31 pictures.&quot; Finally there&apos;s a half-page ad that says, &quot;we will give you 25&amp;pound; if you stop counting now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they found is that generally the luckier a person was, the more likely they were to notice these hints. Some of the unluckiest people made it all the way to the end without seeing any of them. The idea is that luck isn&apos;t something magical, it is simply that some people get into a single track of thought and will miss potentially better opportunities. Luckier people might simply be paying closer attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough when I get to the office an hour late after my boss called me from home, the recycling guys were given the wrong address and have been wandering around northwest for half an hour trying to find this place. They had called my phone not four minutes before I got back to the office. Had David not called though to check up on me, I&apos;d not have run and I&apos;d not have met them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly think I&apos;m open to new potentials. Not so much in an observant sort of way, but moreso in a short attention span sort of way. That doesn&apos;t really explain all the synchronicity. I still like to think God&apos;s watching out for me and not being petty about such trivialities as my belief in Him.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<subject>I have extreme Luck...</subject>
				<body>(did I say &lt;b&gt;good&lt;/b&gt; luck? no, I didn&apos;t...)

Actually, there&apos;s a quote I like that goes something like, &quot;Luck favors the prepared.&quot;

As to serenditous wandering, coupled with my difficulty in having anything like a regular schedule, that&apos;s always fun. I remember skipping classes because I ran into new experiences on campus. Also, talking to strangers will do wonders for meeting interesting people :).

However, I do think in terms of &quot;lucky&quot; opportunities that there are differences outside our control. It is why I really hate arrogant elitism, to assume that your talent, hard work, and mental prowess are 100% of the reason why you got someplace in life is wrong. I imagine my identical twin in Africa or China starving to death because he was born in the middle of a famine or war.

And as to God, I think, if there is an afterlife and God judges us in it, I think many of us will be quite surprised what counted as right and wrong(myself included). Just this week, I met yet another person who doesn&apos;t like Christianity, of which 99% of this was due to the &quot;Christians&quot; she knew... turns out the people who made her turn away are the people who screwed up the Wesley Foundation at the time I left. So, its not like I could really say anything to disagree.

			<event>If you&apos;re in DC, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artomatic.org&quot;&gt;Artomatic&lt;/a&gt;. Now. Go.

I saw some amazing stuff last night. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/purelightseed&quot;&gt;Pure Light Seed&lt;/a&gt; did a really powerful set. Slam poets &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omekongo.com/home2.html&quot;&gt;Omékongo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notarapper.com/base.htm&quot;&gt;Bomani Armah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brokeballer.com&quot;&gt;Droopy&lt;/a&gt; gave some really entertaining performances. To top it off, there&apos;s amazing art all over the place.

The sad thing was there was all this amazing stuff and hardly anyone there. It&apos;s in the austere Crystal City. Imagine a bunch of bohemians invade an office building, cover the walls in graffiti, put up art all over the place and start playing music. Awesomeness, huh? It is definitely worth a visit and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artomatic.org/events/2007/05/4&quot;&gt;next Friday&lt;/a&gt; one of MPP&apos;s own will be performing with Capitol Fire Arts. That ought to be really cool.</event>

			<subject>Shakespeare</subject>
			<event>I went to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shakespearebehindbars.com&quot;&gt;Shakespeare Behind Bars&lt;/a&gt; and it was really moving. It was one of those movies that filled in my picture of life a little bit more &amp;mdash; the lives of criminals and life in prison &amp;mdash; and I shifted how I see the world a bit. I just watched the trailer on the website which doesn&apos;t really give justice to the film, but knowing the story I started to tear up again. Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.

Other activities for the day were less moving. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eggspectations.com&quot;&gt;Eggspectations&lt;/a&gt; had a nice bloody mary and reasonable crepes, but the hollandaise sauce tasted like mayo and butter. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L&apos;Auberge_espagnole&quot;&gt;L&apos;Auberge espagnole&lt;/a&gt; was cute and had its moments, but I was unentertained by what I saw as the protagonist&apos;s largely passionless philandering.</event>

			<event>&lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/gallery/&quot;&gt;Gallery&lt;/a&gt; has died again. It&apos;s getting kinda irritating since it tends to do so about every month or so. I don&apos;t think it is really the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.menalto.com&quot;&gt;gallery program&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s fault entirely. I suspect that &lt;a href=&quot;http://dreamhost.com&quot;&gt;Dreamhost&lt;/a&gt; is cutting the processes off early and it isn&apos;t handling it well.

It&apos;s a pain not only because of the outage but also because I have to reload everything. There&apos;s too many pictures though and it chokes. Even after loading them incrementally, I still lose the captions. (Version changes kept me from restoring the database.)

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wholcomb/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; is cool. I like the geotagging and community bits. I&apos;m tempted to drop the $25 to create an account for a year. (Since it will take a while to upload 10gb of photos &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/help/limits/#28&quot;&gt;100mb at a time&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smugmug.com/community/PeaceCorpsRIM&quot;&gt;smugmug&lt;/a&gt; looks pretty good, but it&apos;s $40. There&apos;s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://picasa.google.com&quot;&gt;Picasa&lt;/a&gt; which would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=39567&amp;topic=8993&quot;&gt;$25 for 6.25gb&lt;/a&gt;.

Honestly I&apos;m frustrated since I have hosting. It&apos;s kinda sad that there&apos;s not a &lt;acronym title=&quot;Free/Libre/Open Source Software&quot;&gt;FLOSS&lt;/acronym&gt; offering that works well. I love the idea of trying to write one myself, but who&apos;s got the time? Maybe someday.</event>

				<body>There is a possibility(I put it at 50/50) that a photography company may be paying Metanotion Software to put together a site for them to upload proofs for customers to select and purchase.

In terms of reuse, it will quite likely not be exactly what you&apos;re looking for, but since it will be a pure PHP play, it would likely be useful to you to look at. Its not going to be FLOSS, but there are times when &quot;Free to me&quot; is good enough :).</body>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;Between Wayne, my mom and myself took about 2000 pictures over our two weeks in Peru. They were all named random stuff like IMG_1985.jpg. I figured to get them sorted, I&apos;d name them according to their dates. Once I got it done I discovered that Wayne&apos;s camera is off by 12 hours. After I did a little research I found that there&apos;s a handy Linux utility that&apos;s exactly what I need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;jhead -ta-12:00 -model SD500 *jpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do the renaming then is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;jhead -n%Y:%m:%d_%H:%M:%S *jpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>So I go download that utility and I can time shift my pictures?

Cause I neglected to change the time on my camera when I went to New Zealand.  It&apos;s only annoying since the days just aren&apos;t quite in the right place.

Plus Wayne&apos;s pictures from Denver could be shifted so they would merge better with mine.  The filenames weren&apos;t such an issue but all my photo software on my computer puts them in chronological order by that date.</body>

			<event>I don&apos;t know if it is the exhaustion from working all day or if I&apos;m just in a sappy stretch of shows, but the last three episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Archive.aspx&quot;&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; that I&apos;ve been listening to all day have brought me to tears.

It&apos;s a really good show. The more recent episodes with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/player/CPRadio_player.php?podcast=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/xmlfeeds/331.xml&amp;proxyloc=http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/player/customproxy.php&quot;&gt;stories from Iraq&lt;/a&gt; are particularly interesting.</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m getting ready to start grad school in the fall. I&apos;ve been e-mailing back and forth with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~adamsja/&quot;&gt;my adviser&lt;/a&gt; and discussing potential classes. I&apos;m pretty sure I know what I want to take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CS-352-1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Human-Computer Interaction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;TR&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;09:35 - 10:50&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;An overview of human-computer interaction and problems of current interest. Human factors, GOMS, user interface design and evaluation, interaction modalities, distributed cognition, ubiquitous computing. A project involving design and evaluation will be performed.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CS-360-1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Advanced Artificial Intelligence&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;TR&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13:10 - 14:25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Discussion of state of the art and current research issues in heuristic search, knowledge representation, deduction, and reasoning. Related application areas include: planning systems, qualitative reasoning, cognitive models of human memory, user modeling in ICAI, reasoning with uncertainty, knowledge-based system design, and language comprehension.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PSY-3100P-1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Statistical Inference&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;MWF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11:10 - 12:25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Introductory course designed to familiarize doctoral students with the principles and procedures of statistical inference and to prepare them for more advanced work in research design and analysis.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to have only Tuesday/Thursday classes so I could sneak off to Baltimore for long weekends, but that doesn&apos;t really look possible. I could take a different CS class to make it work, but the psych statistics class is part of a plan to integrate some more rigorous testing methods into &lt;acronym title=&quot;Human-Computer Interaction&quot;&gt;HCI&lt;/acronym&gt; evaluation and I like the idea.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been getting my schedule worked out for the next semester. I figure it&apos;s best to treat school like a job and show up and work fairly regular hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been riding in with &lt;lj user=&quot;the_archange1&quot;&gt; and that&apos;s nice since it puts me here around 8:00. I was listening to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://odeo.com/show/3351643/view&quot;&gt;insightful podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;lj user=&quot;get_brett&quot;&gt; that recommended at least having productive things to procrastinate on if you&apos;re going to be doing it. I figure I&apos;ll at least not sleep or watch TV if I&apos;m in my office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My schedule is filling up rather quickly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Days&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Location&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Office Hours&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;MW&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:30-10:30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanderbilt.edu/map/map.cgi?mode=1&amp;bldg=jacobs.html&quot;&gt;Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; 357/360&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PSY-3100P &amp;mdash; Statistical Inference&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;MWF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11:10-12:25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanderbilt.edu/map/map.cgi?mode=1&amp;bldg=hobbs.html&quot;&gt;Hobbs&lt;/a&gt; 107&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Office Hours&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;TR&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11:00-12:00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanderbilt.edu/map/map.cgi?mode=1&amp;bldg=jacobs.html&quot;&gt;Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; 357/360&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Lab Meeting&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14:30-15:30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanderbilt.edu/map/map.cgi?mode=1&amp;bldg=jacobs.html&quot;&gt;Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; 360&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Withit Lecture&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;R&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15:10-16:10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanderbilt.edu/map/map.cgi?mode=1&amp;bldg=featheringill.html&quot;&gt; Featheringill&lt;/a&gt; 130&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CS-151 Tutorial&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;19:00-20:00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanderbilt.edu/map/map.cgi?mode=1&amp;bldg=jacobs.html&quot;&gt;Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; 306&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m still dealing with getting settled here. I&apos;m having trouble seeing how I go from where I am now to a settled adult life and that is a little depressing. I figure if I just keep plugging away either I&apos;ll get though it or I&apos;ll learn definitely what needs to change. In either case the thing to do at this point is to keep working.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

				<body>The big thing is kids. I figure they need a place to sleep and regular food and whatnot.

I was actually raking the garbage out of the yard of my new house the other day and thinking, &quot;I&apos;m too old to live like a college student.&quot; I won&apos;t say I&apos;ve gotten prissy per se, but the quality that goes into the construction and maintenance of my living environment is definitely more of a priority.

I spent most of last week putting a bamboo floor in my girlfriend&apos;s house and it was really satisfying to see the improvement at the end.</body>

			<subject>Men</subject>
			<event>I noticed a neat essay in &lt;lj user=&quot;titivillus&quot;&gt;&apos;s journal: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psy.fsu.edu/%7Ebaumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm&quot;&gt;Is There Anything Good About Men?&lt;/a&gt; It makes some interesting points about potential cultural and evolutionary reasons for the existence of a patriarchy. It also makes the good point that while many of our leaders are male, a sizable chunk of our criminals are as well.

I think it&apos;s a interesting article to read and contemplate. I don&apos;t really like the dichotomizing that seems to underlie the whole thing. Gender has been a big issue for me for a while. It started because I was detached and unemotional to the point of feeling dead in my life. As I started trying to understand ways to be more connected in my life and relationships I kept bumping into the stereotype that the things I wanted weren&apos;t part of being a real man. It really took me down for a while. Remember that it wasn&apos;t that I was having these feelings and was looking to deal with them; I felt completely broken away from my life and I felt at times that people were telling me that there was nothing I could do about it because I have a Y chromosome.

My response to gender at this point is there may be certain cultural or genetic predispositions, but their strength and prevalence is so variable that it&apos;s completely useless as a measure of anything about an individual &amp;mdash; about like race. So I could be reading an article about how slavery and selective breeding affected the genetic characteristics of Africans in America. It would be interesting and the statistics would be interesting to consider, but I would not let the information affect how I deal with a random black person I meet on the street.

I was thinking about that example. I, and I think most people, have a little voice in my head that actively chastises me if there are any racial stereotypes in my head when I&apos;m talking to someone new. (Though I spent about two hours last night learning to be aware of race &amp;mdash; I was watching Chappelle&apos;s Show.) I&apos;ve got a definite socialization against being racist. So far as gender though and making assumptions about a person based on their gender, I dislike it, but it&apos;s mostly from my own thinking. Socially I&apos;ve got some little voices about the value of women&apos;s rights, but things about a person&apos;s emotionality, aggressiveness, or interests are all fair game.

The bit that I distinctly disliked was the last paragraph. I read it as essentially, &quot;There are many critics of how our society operates. There are a variety of reasons that things have progressed this way and the fitness of this type of society is why it has won out. We should think twice before screwing up something that works.&quot;

The &quot;this is the way we&apos;ve been doing things and it works&quot; is a horrible argument and one neednt look any farther than the pyramids to see accomplishing amazing things is not the only criteria for judging a system. I really do believe that the human animal has a capacity for amazing complexity that most people never even get near because they&apos;re too busy chasing the brass ring or pleasing their parents or their church or just playing out some random drama.

				<body>Amen Brother. I wholeheartedly agree with you that people in general act according to other people&apos;s expectations instead of using that as information to independently develop their own set. 

Using the logic that this *works* so I shouldn&apos;t change has kinda been a theme I&apos;ve observed for people&apos;s less-than-ideal behavior lately. Articles like this could even be harmful in that they reinforce complacency with what is rather than encouraging people to look to what can be.</body>

				<body>I think your response has much in common with mine. I am strongly for equal rights, and I definitely would rate &quot;because it works, we shouldn&apos;t mess with it.&quot; to be a poor reason for just anything.

I think I did have a slightly different feeling about what the gist was though, and that was probably colored by my past experiences, which in many ways was similar to yours, of being told that because I&apos;m a male, there is nothing I can do about some particular trait, or I just just accept that its going to be that way.

My response was that a feeling of, &quot;this is how and why the old system works, making a unilateral change to one part of this equation would throw things out of balance, and should be made realizing that there are just as many destructive stereotypes and gender roles that males are forced into, in fact.&quot;

I guess it was feeling that framing gender roles as something used by society felt more correct than &quot;male vs. female&quot;. In that sense, men are &quot;used&quot; by society, just as much as women. Its definitely different, and certainly, much better for some males, but its still being &quot;used&quot;. In that sense, a more equitable solution is to realize that both sides need to be helped and society should move toward a solution that allows everyone to expand the roles they are allowed to take(which, very likely, has very little &quot;normative&quot; about it).

In regard to marriage for instance, Maia is currently unemployed, and its amazing how many people are mean to her(and me) by expressing approval that she *should* stay home, and that its the most natural thing in the world to *expect* me to provide enough income for two(or more people). If Maia wants to work, that&apos;s fine by me, and indeed, I&apos;m happy that I *can* provide enough for two right now, but there are many paths which could lead to all this changing dramatically(indeed, I expect the situation and roles to change over a wide range of values through our lives). We are a team, and we work together, there&apos;s no &quot;proper&quot; way for that work(in a gender role sense, or nearly any other).

Oh well, its a complex topic, and hard to talk about effectively.

I try to respect and love all people for their unique gifts. Thats particularly hard today, in fact, but I can&apos;t really talk about that in public, except to say I had a business deal go bad wrong, and I got left holding the bag.

				<body>Um, I should clarify, Maia is not &quot;unemployed&quot; in the sense of doing nothing. She&apos;s just not working in a job as a research chemist(which is approximatly what she wants to do, I think, if anyone is hiring, let me know :) ).

We are figuring out different ways for us to help each other, but I certainly don&apos;t wish to hold her back, and its pretty painful for me to watch her not find the success she wants.

Well, speaking of providing for two... back to work...</body>

				<body>Sounds like being in the small town environment is making it harder for you all to do a lot of the things you&apos;d like to be doing. Not least of which is having gender roles that aren&apos;t traditionally encouraged by the people you&apos;re surrounded by. </body>

			<event>My first semester as a graduate student has come and gone. It has certainly been a learning process.

So far as the amount of actual information I learned, it was acceptable. I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/classes/cs352/&quot;&gt;Human-Computer Interaction&lt;/a&gt; which primarily dealt with user interface tests for software development. I&apos;d seen most of that in work before, but there was some bits about doing statistical analyses that were new and interesting.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/classes/psy310/&quot;&gt;Statistical Inference&lt;/a&gt; was my favorite class. It was also mostly a repeat of information I&apos;d &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/classes/math347/&quot;&gt;had before&lt;/a&gt;, but we had nice little tables instead of all that messy integrating. The different tests were new though and the review was useful. I also managed to get more of my notes types up this time which I figure will be useful in the future.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/classes/cs360/&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; was drudgery. They combined the grad and undergrad sections since one of the professors was off on sabbatical. The main difference ended up being huge amounts of homework. I&apos;d certainly not claim that I didn&apos;t learn anything, but the process was at times a bit frustrating.

All in all though I&apos;m still happy with my decision to start this trip. Grad school in some ways aged me. Having two or three homework assignments that required 30-40 hours to complete over the course of two weeks actively sucked some of the fun out of me. It meant I spent quite a few nights at home while &lt;lj user=&quot;the_archange1&quot;&gt; was out and about. I&apos;d like to be able to say that when I had fun it was all the more intense, but honestly it wasn&apos;t. The stress and the fatigue made me more boring, but I learned how to get a shitton of work done and that&apos;s a skill I&apos;ve been wanting for a while.</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;On the subject of grad school, I got the reviews from my teaching assistantship. Once a week I would give a recitation on some subject concerning ethics and computer science. All sorts of stuff from net neutrality to the history of hacking to the development of intellectual property law in America. I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately I also had to grade an essay per week for each of the 35 students and that was less entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt pretty good about the recitations. I&apos;m about as geeky as anyone I know and this was essentially geek story time for an hour. My audience was 30 Malaysian students which was a bit challenging, but over the course of the semester I saw a real improvement in their critical thinking skills and writing proficiency. In the end that&apos;s what I really enjoy about teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did wonder though about what they thought. After I&apos;d stepped up the grading criteria on one of their essays, I asked them if they&apos;d rather if I just saved us all some time, skipped reading the papers and just gave them all B+. All but two said &quot;yes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&apos;ve been wanting to play with Google&apos;s Charts API.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-top:1.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;How helpful and responsive was the TA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bhs&amp;chs=400x225&amp;chd=t:0,0,42,92,64&amp;chbh=35&amp;chf=bg,s,FFF2CC&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chxl=0:|0%|25%|50%|1:|Excellent|Good|Average|Marginal|Poor&quot; alt=&quot;graph&quot;&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-top:1.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;How was the TA&apos;s fairness in grading?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bhs&amp;chs=400x225&amp;chd=t:0,22,58,100,14&amp;chbh=35&amp;chf=bg,s,FFF2CC&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chxl=0:|0%|25%|50%|1:|Excellent|Good|Average|Marginal|Poor&quot; alt=&quot;graph&quot;&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-top:1.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the TA communicate effectively?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bhs&amp;chs=400x225&amp;chd=t:0,8,50,86,58&amp;chbh=35&amp;chf=bg,s,FFF2CC&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chxl=0:|0%|25%|50%|1:|Excellent|Good|Average|Marginal|Poor&quot; alt=&quot;graph&quot;&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-top:1.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your overall rating of the TA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bhs&amp;chs=400x225&amp;chd=t:0,14,28,100,58&amp;chbh=35&amp;chf=bg,s,FFF2CC&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chxl=0:|0%|25%|50%|1:|Excellent|Good|Average|Marginal|Poor&quot; alt=&quot;graph&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After bleeding all over their papers and making them work fairly hard, I&apos;m pretty cool with having 80%+ giving me good or excellent. I&apos;d really like to get to teach a class like this at some point in the future. I would really like to see what could be done with it if it were treated as a persuasive writing and critical thinking class as much as a survey of ethics issues. Many of the students weren&apos;t even really in a position to fully appreciate the issues they were introduced to and I think it would have been interesting to try and address that problem.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>This is complete geekitude, so feel free to disregard&amp;hellip;

I want to take a DVD, stick it in the drive and at some point have the smallest file possible that contains as much of the original structure as possible.

There are a few problems with most of how this is done most of the time. When you download a video off the internet there are several parts that go into that file. There&apos;s the sound and the video streams and then a container that joins them all together. The container syncs the streams and says, this second of audio goes with this second of video.

The most common container format in use currently is &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q316992#16&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Audio Video Interleave&quot;&gt;AVI&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  from Microsoft. AVI is a fairly old format and it has several limitations. One of the most important for my purposes is it pairs one video with one audio track. That&apos;s fine when you&apos;re encoding your home movies, but it can&apos;t handle dubbing and director&apos;s commentaries for DVDs.

There are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_container_formats&quot;&gt;couple new formats&lt;/a&gt; to consider, but the one I like the most is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matroska.org&quot;&gt;Matroska&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s flexible and supports not only the multiple audio streams but also multiple subtitles.

Inside the container there are even more standards at work. The raw data for audio waveforms and video images is huge. Different compressions schemes, called codecs, are used to compress the data and make it take up less space. They operate in a variety of ways, but ultimately the goal is a tradeoff between the degradation of the image or sound quality and the size of the output file.

Audio compression has seen a bit of improvement over the old workhorse MP3, but the real improvements in technology in recent years has been in the realm of video compression. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264&quot;&gt;H.264&lt;/a&gt; is able to produce a file that is nearly visually identical to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2&quot;&gt;MPEG-2&lt;/a&gt; used on DVDs in fraction of the space.

There are some programs, notably &lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.fr&quot;&gt;HandBrake&lt;/a&gt;, that do a pretty good job of doing what I want. Before HandBrake was released however, I started on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/dvd_rip.py&quot;&gt;ripping program of my own&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve been playing with it for a bit and this morning I had a bit of a breakthrough.

When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://untrepid.com/acidrip/lsdvd.html&quot;&gt;list the contents of the DVD&lt;/a&gt;, it tells me in general that the video is in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;National Television System Committee&quot;&gt;NTSC&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That makes sense, since NTSC is what we use here in America. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mplayerhq.hu&quot;&gt;encoder&lt;/a&gt; was complaining though  about dropping frames which shouldn&apos;t happen if I was encoding at the right rate.

It turns out that though NTSC is 60000/1001 frames per second and interlaced every other frame NTSC is 30000/1001, movies are filmed at 24000/1001 and that is how they&apos;re stored on progressive DVDs. In running my encoding previously at 29.97 and ending up with a file around 1500mb. I switched to 23.976 and the file size dropped by 500mb.</event>

			<subject>Voting</subject>
			<event>I went with &lt;lj user=&quot;the_archange1&quot;&gt; to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://uncountedthemovie.com&quot;&gt;Uncounted&lt;/a&gt; a couple nights ago. The thesis of the movie is that modern electronic voting machines are not only open to hacking, but there is extremely strong evidence that voter fraud has been committed in several elections including the 2004 Bush/Kerry presidential election.

Honestly, when are conspiracy theories ever true? Their case looked pretty solid though.

One of the more interesting statistics were &lt;a href=&quot;http://uncountedthemovie.com/the-issues-undervoting.html&quot;&gt;anomalies in undervoting&lt;/a&gt;. An undervote is when a voter comes to the poll, votes in some races, but expresses no preference in others. This makes sense at times. Yesterday I could easily not have had an opinion on who the Democrat candidate for city council should be.

In presidential elections there tends to be an undervote of 1-3%. In New Mexico in 2004 in certain Native American and Hispanic precincts there were undervotes of up to 80%. 4 out of 5 people went to the poll and just didn&apos;t have an opinion on who the President should be. It&apos;s particularly interesting that it happened in Democratic strongholds.

There was also an &lt;a href=&quot;http://uncountedthemovie.com/the-issues-exit-poll.html&quot;&gt;analysis of a comparison between the exit polls and the actual results&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;m actually in a stats class right now and I have a newfound respect for the degree to which studies and statistical analysis have a serious mathematical basis. The issue wasn&apos;t simply that the polling data disagreed with the result. There could have been some unseen factor to push error beyond any previous amount of error they&apos;ve seen. It was that over and over the errors favored Bush.

There&apos;s quite a bit more about things like the suspicious proportioning of voting machines that had primarily low-income minorities standing in line to vote in Ohio for up to 12 hours. I&apos;d highly recommend watching the movie if you have a chance.

If you happen to live in Tennessee, you can support &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislature.state.tn.us/bills/currentga/asp/WebBillInfo/BillCompanionInfo.aspx?BillNumber=SB1363&quot;&gt;SB1363/HB1256&lt;/a&gt; which would remove Tennessee from the 12 states that allow voting machines with no paper trail whatsoever. (With no paper trail the vote count is whatever the machine tells you it is and there is no method for verification. If nothing else, anyone who has dealt with a computer should know better than to do this. Absolutely &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; programmer writes bug-free code all the time.)

Even if you don&apos;t think there&apos;s been a conspiracy, there&apos;s no reason not to prevent one in the future.</event>

				<body>As someone who has been accused of being a conspiracy theory nut in the past, and as a fellow programmer, I feel the need to weigh in :).

First off, completely ignoring the conspiracy angle: Voting machines containing software contain bugs. &lt;b&gt;This. Is. A. Fact.&lt;/b&gt; One of the only semi sane ways to correct this is a paper trail(however... no receipts, do you want to make vote buying &lt;b&gt;that&lt;/b&gt; easy).

Honestly, &quot;debugging&quot; is the art of subverting a system. Even if everyone of the people involved in the design of those machines had good intentions, there are all kinds of dramatic, fascinating, twisted, &quot;wtf?&quot; ways of subverting these systems. (Have you ever considered selling your vote and using your cellphone&apos;s camera to provide proof in the booth? How about RFID tags letting thieves scan semi-trucks to know whether its toliet paper or 42&quot; plasma TV&apos;s(and therefore worth stealing)? Or opening a checking account, to immediately close it the next day, and then using the temporary checks to purchase stuff...)

So, supporting the requirement of a paper trail is the least we can do.

			<subject>Why I Like MusicBrainz</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen an increasing amount of interest in music recommendations. Music is being created and published at a rate that far outstrips the ability of any listener to keep up with. How then, if I&apos;m an artist, can I get my awesome new song to the ears of listeners? Or, if I&apos;m a music connoisseur, how can I sort through the thousands of songs to find the few I&apos;ll love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oldest recommendation system is still going strong: word of mouth. &quot;Dude, you&apos;ve got to hear this&amp;hellip;&quot; will always be a vector for music to spread. Another old-school system is one where I pick a bunch of songs I like and send them out over the airways to anyone who would like to hear. The internet is changing the ballgame, however. The advent of computers, in addition to fundamentally altering how people create and distribute music, also promises to change how they discover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the earliest systems were what are known as &quot;collaborative filters.&quot; A computer system, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.com&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, knows thousands of albums that various people have purchased. Assuming that people liked the albums they bought, if Bob and I both bought ten of the same albums, when Bob buys an 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, there&apos;s a better than average chance that I&apos;ll like that album as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems like &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandora.com&quot;&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt; work in a similar way, but not only have they broken things down from albums to individual songs, they also look at specific characteristics of songs. So, now the system can say, not only, &quot;people who liked the songs you like also liked&amp;hellip;,&quot; but also, &quot;you have liked 9 of 10 R&amp;B songs I played for you with melodic tones and three male singers, here&apos;s another song that sounds like those.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandora&apos;s knowledge of music comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pandora.com/mgp.shtml&quot;&gt;Music Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;. Human listeners have spent countless hours reviewing &quot;tens of thousands of artists&quot; and cataloging God-only-knows how many characteristics. That&apos;s cool, but not really an undertaking the average person has time for, so there&apos;s quite a bit of research into how to get computer programs to listen to the songs for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems employ a variety of different types of signal analyses, most taking into account human perceptive characteristics (we are more sensitive to high frequency noises than low ones). They not only attempt to determine traditional characteristics such as beats per minute, key, and timing; they also represent &quot;timbral characteristics,&quot; like the signal strength 3-4kHz, that human listener would never use to describe music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s quite a bit of research in this area including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ismir.net&quot;&gt;International Conferences on Music Information Retrieval and Related Activities&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu&quot;&gt;Laboratory for the Recognition and Organization of Speech and Audio&lt;/a&gt; at Columbia, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iua.upf.edu/mtg/&quot;&gt;Music Technology Group&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.upf.edu/&quot;&gt;Universitat Pompeu Fabra&lt;/a&gt;. Research is also driven by a growing rapidly group of private commercial interests too numerous to list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more interesting developments for me, a solo programmer and graduate student in an unrelated field, are open-source projects. These are areas where I can take part and help create something interesting. One of the more promising is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/&quot;&gt;Paul Lamere&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.sun.com/projects/dashboard.php?id=153&quot;&gt;Search Inside the Music&lt;/a&gt; project with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sun.com&quot;&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to a crucial issue for every computer program ever written: data. Systems like &lt;a href=&quot;http://last.fm&quot;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; will integrate with your music player so that every song you play goes toward helping the system build a profile of preferences. Accessing actual songs to play with spectral analysis on a large scale is a bit more complex. The options are fourfold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a deal with the record companies gaining some sort of license &amp;mdash; Unlikely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy tens of thousands of songs online &amp;mdash; I&apos;m poor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use creative commons sources such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://magnatune.com&quot;&gt;Magnatune&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; Limits selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steal as much music as the internet will allow &amp;mdash; Illegal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these has advantages, but ultimately with all of them I run out of space to store all these songs. Also, part of the point is community building,  and the point at which I try to open the system to other people (other than with the creative commons sources), I&apos;m in legal trouble. What would really be nice is if I had an online system that I could query about the characteristics of songs (or a database of info I could download). The tricky part is building that database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last couple weeks, a couple systems have come online (&lt;a href=&quot;http://analyze.echonest.com/AudioAnalysis.html&quot;&gt;EchoNest&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/webservice/&quot;&gt;Vienna MIR&lt;/a&gt;) that let you send in a song and get back an XML description of the audio characteristics. That&apos;s a fine idea, but it limits the songs I can do computations on to songs I have a copy of. It also means I need to transfer whole files over which means if I want to experiment on a 5,000 song set, I need to start about a week early just so I can send all my songs over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I&apos;m listening to The Nature by Talib Kweli. If someone else has already analyzed this song, I don&apos;t need to send the song over. I just need to tell the system I want The Nature and it can send me the data I want. This saves both the time to transfer the song and the time to analyze it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the problem becomes how to tell the system what song I want. For many rap and folk bands there are often myriad versions of a particular song. Lots of new XML based technologies use URIs, and that makes sense, but how to make a unique one for each song? Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://musicbrainz.org&quot;&gt;MusicBrainz&lt;/a&gt;. They are a huge (more than 6,300,000 tracks and growing) community maintained database of songs, and they&apos;ve assigned a unique identifier to each one. If I know the MusicBrainz id for a particular song then I can refer unambiguously about it to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MusicBrainz has some limitations that would eventually be a problem. Mostly that they are &quot;album-based&quot; meaning they don&apos;t deal with DJ mixes or bootlegs. Also so far as a completely open process, they use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.musicip.com/dns/&quot;&gt;MusicDNS&lt;/a&gt; which is partially encumbered. That would matter eventually, but those concerns are outweighed by the huge amount of data and community support you&apos;d get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may well be other good solutions to the data problem. I like the MusicBrainz idea because it gives a project like Search Inside the Music a pre-built community and support structure. It would also draw users to help build MusicBrainz as a resource for both tagging and music recommendation applications.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Settling</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m on a list that is discussing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/single-marry&quot;&gt;Lori Gottlieb&apos;s &lt;cite&gt;Marry Him!&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where she presents herself as a single mother through artificial insemination advising young girls to give settling serious consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[A]sk any soul-baring 40-year-old single heterosexual woman what she most longs for in life, and she probably won&apos;t tell you it&apos;s a better career or a smaller waistline or a bigger apartment. Most likely, she&apos;ll say that what she really wants is a husband (and, by extension, a child)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[E]very woman I know &amp;mdash; no matter how successful and ambitious, how financially and emotionally secure &amp;mdash; feels panic, occasionally coupled with desperation, if she hits 30 and finds herself unmarried&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[O]ne of the most complicated, painful, and pervasive dilemmas many single women are forced to grapple with nowadays: Is it better to be alone, or to settle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My advice is this: Settle! That&apos;s right. &amp;hellip; [S]ettling will probably make you happier in the long run.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article definitely has its strong points. I like the focus on just being aware of how your decisions today are going to play out in the long term. I see too many of my friends letting opportunities pass them by because there&apos;s always tomorrow. The thing is that, eventually, there isn&apos;t a tomorrow. If some young person reads this article and it makes her see where she might end up in fifteen years, great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gottlieb builds a fivefold argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s a really good chance a husband and kids are going to be better company in your old age than your cats as you sit alone eating Cheerios for Christmas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&apos;re probably going to get less hot as you get older.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guy&apos;s tend to date under their age range more than women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marriage isn&apos;t so much like traipsing daily through a rose garden as much as it is like managing a small boring corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hotness isn&apos;t going to get the dog walked and trash taken out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience is young women, telling them to get out of the rat race while the getting&apos;s good. My issue is so many people never really got in the race in the first place. Yesterday was Valentine&apos;s Day and I know quite a few young folks who spent it all by their lonesome. Every one of them knows some interesting person they could have had dinner with. I refuse to believe that anyone is just so amazingly hot and cool that in this city of half a million people they can&apos;t find someone who&apos;s at least intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s easy. I&apos;ve been out there on the market before. What I think people should take away from Gottlieb&apos;s article is the idea things are only going to get worse. She uses this as a reason to settle, but I think the average person could just do with a long hard look at how much they&apos;re exploring their possibilities rather than marrying Hugo the hunchbacked garbage man. There&apos;s this awesome interweb thing now that lets you find people looking for dates in the very city you live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her point about priorities is an important one as well. One of the big reasons I&apos;m a proponent of dating is you start off your life with these ideas of the kind of person you want to be with and every so often you find that when you actually try to actually live with that sort of person it&apos;s annoying. You don&apos;t generally get anything for free. I person that&apos;s really intelligent is more likely to be arrogant. A driven person could well be less fun. A party person might be irresponsible. I&apos;d say one of the important lessons graduate school has taught me is that doing complicated and meaningful professional work takes a lot of time and energy. You don&apos;t get to be as fun, and that&apos;s just a part of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you can&apos;t find the awesome guy you&apos;ve been seeking, consider the distinct possibility that he&apos;s a figment of your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t like the paired Rachel/Barry and Carrie/Aidan examples. Rachel dumped Barry because their life together was materialistic and she realized the person she was agreeing to become by marrying him. To anyone, if you feel pressured to be a type of person you don&apos;t like to be in a relationship, get the hell out of there. Carrie out looking for a thrill was just a dumb move. Not the same class of decision at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to settling though? Horrible horrible suggestion. More than half of marriages end in divorce currently. It&apos;s obviously a high pressure situation. How likely is it that even going into it with lowered expectations that you are going to make it last?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s mostly just a bad idea from the perspective of love. Falling in love is a hormonal roller coaster borne of a complicated psychological and hormonal dance. Maybe you&apos;ll get to do that and maybe you won&apos;t. It&apos;s great fun, but it isn&apos;t the solid sort of thing you base a marriage off of. Love is a more complicated and subtle beast. It&apos;s comes from a freedom to be yourself and a commitment to something essential in another person. I will say unequivocally that a lack of respect for your partner is going to limit your ability to love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&apos;s wonderful to reevaluate where you&apos;re at in your life and what your priorities and options are. To not do so is to waste your time in a fantasy land. If settling is simply adjusting your expectations, great. If settling means thinking, &quot;I could do better&quot; or &quot;I warrant better&quot; you&apos;re not only poisoning the waters and sabotaging your relationship; you&apos;re doing a fundamental disservice to this person you&apos;re wanting to build a life with you.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<event>&lt;p&gt;This is just a brief note to any command line users such as myself to remember the handiness of the little utility &lt;code&gt;dc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wandering the web and came across an &lt;a href=&quot;http://snagwiremedia.com/24fitclub/&quot;&gt;estimate of basal metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. Now I know such thinks are affected by fitness level and whatnot, but I wanted to know quickly what the result was and I wanted to see all the numbers at once so I could know if I was copying them correctly. On the command line, this is just:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo 195 2.2 / 11.6 \* 879 + p | dc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where 195 is my weight, 2.2 is the pounds in a kilogram and 11.6 and 879 are the line parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As I look at this I start to recognize that most people would find calculator more intuitive. &amp;#X263A; This is for the geekier among you.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>Musics</subject>
			<event>So, I&apos;m lining up summer plans and looking to do something music informatics.

One of the front runners for places I would like to end up is at Sun interning with Project Aura (which is a meld of Sun&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.sun.com/projects/dashboard.php?id=153&quot;&gt;Search Inside the Music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.sun.com/projects/dashboard.php?id=101&quot;&gt;Advanced Search Technology&lt;/a&gt;).

I had a phone interview earlier this week and one of the questions was the specific areas I&apos;m interested in investigating. I attempted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://odin.himinbi.org/classes/cs360/literature_review.html#intro&quot;&gt;literatue survey&lt;/a&gt; and discovered the field of &lt;acronym title=&quot;Music Information Retrieval&quot;&gt;MIR&lt;/acronym&gt; is large and active. As I was contemplating the question of the most interesting parts last night, I remembered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/entry/music_research_blogs&quot;&gt;list of MIR research blogs&lt;/a&gt;.

I&apos;m realizing the extent to which the internet is growing to play a role in certain areas of research. My adviser was saying it can take up to a year to get a paper from submission to publication. Blogs in particular let a community of researchers keep up with each other. From reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pipes.yahoo.com/musicresearch/8mJZ_3HT3BGTNXn_6kjTQA&quot;&gt;MIR blogs&lt;/a&gt;, I can&apos;t imagine a researcher really being current in the field without paying at least a little bit of attention to them.

I&apos;ve been wanting to set up a feed aggregator. I figured why not use this as an opportunity to deepen my relationship with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/ig&quot;&gt;gracious electronic overlord&lt;/a&gt;. So far I&apos;ve been pretty happy with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/reader/&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;. I understand blogging a bit better both as a community building tool, but also as a medium for communication.

I have a bit on blogs, MIR and technologists, but I&apos;m going to split it out into &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivankara.livejournal.com/74610.html&quot;&gt;another entry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;</event>

			<subject>The Role of Recommendations</subject>
			<event>So, on blogging, I was reading an post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://kurtisrandom.blogspot.com/2008/02/listen-to-musicians-not-listeners.html&quot;&gt;Kurt Jacobson&lt;/a&gt; on avoiding mob rule in determining music quality. I have thoughts on the issue and want to have a conversation. I don&apos;t actually know the guy, so through the medium of blogging we just both shout our ideas out into the ether.

The basic idea he&apos;s hitting on is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof&quot;&gt;social proof&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s essentially the fact (and I say fact because there&apos;s enough research to make it pretty much indisputable) that human perception and preference is highly malleable, and one of the biggest influences is what they see other people doing.

In music recommendation this played out in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5762/854&quot;&gt;study on recommendations in an artificial culture&lt;/a&gt;. One group was given a bunch of songs and asked to rank them. Another group was given the same task, but they were given feedback on how much other people liked the same songs.

The results from the first group were fairly consistent. This suggests that there are some inherent qualities of songs that are consistent across listeners. (The test was conducted on a &quot;teen-interest&quot; site, so there was probably some perceptual preference similarity among samples.) With the introduction of social influence, scores became much more erratic and predictability dropped.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://kurtisrandom.blogspot.com/2008/02/listen-to-musicians-not-listeners.html&quot;&gt;Jacobson&apos;s argument&lt;/a&gt; is essentially Britney Spears is crap and if we let the mob decide what good music is, we&apos;ll have a sort of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgenics&quot;&gt;dysgenic collapse&lt;/a&gt; as the masses all follow each other into a collective mediocracy.

There&apos;s certainly something to that argument. The consistency in preferences without social influence says that there is some sort of inherent quality to music. (Whether this quality would hold up under a more diverse sample population is debatable.) If I am wanting to recommend a song to someone who has none of the social feedback, I am going to want to use the consistent sample set because I can predict with less error that they&apos;re going to like the song.

The idea though that technology should somehow try to correct for humanity&apos;s herding instinct is philosophically dangerous and ultimately counter productive. Most people don&apos;t want you to correct for their weaknesses. They want you to give them what they want. In fact, the bulk of people would find the technologist&apos;s assertion that they need their preferences accommodated for slightly insulting.

One of the things I would have liked to see in the study was means for the data. They put data in terms of market share which is interesting, but I would like to know if the average rating was higher. There was the recent study on how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/99532.php&quot;&gt;a $2.50 placebo is 25% more effective than a $.10 one&lt;/a&gt;. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the user enjoyment of music with high community approval was higher than when the song was heard in isolation. It isn&apos;t just that people take cues from their environment, but that their actual experience is different.

So instead of trying to somehow fight against social proof, instead use it and try to introduce systemic constraints to encourage &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/entry/evaluating_music_recommendations&quot;&gt;novelty&lt;/a&gt;.

Imagine a site where people nominate songs for song of the day. A song of the day can never have been a song of the day before. (Or to have more variety, disallow the top 10 each day from future consideration.) The criteria for deciding the song for the day is based on votes from all the users. There&apos;s some sort of mechanism where the more often a user is correct the more their opinion counts. I&apos;d have to think on the details, but you essentially develop experts within a particular genre whose natural preference profiles are very similar to a stereotype. This would bias the results toward reproducibility.

The details would need some thinking, but the basic idea is you want to use social proof to increase a user&apos;s enjoyment while somehow encouraging the introduction of novel ideas. There&apos;s already a hugely implemented system dealing with this exact problem: the stock market. You want to find a resource before anyone else knows about it (find novel music) and after you&apos;ve invested in it, you want to see it perform as well as possible (have as many people rank it as possible). I think a site based around that concept would be interesting.

I don&apos;t disagree that there is such a thing as great art. I&apos;m just not convinced that computers are capable of recognizing that on their own. The best that we can do is set things up so that hopefully the human capability to recognize beauty is captured as much as possible and leveraged.</event>

				<body>&lt;a href=&quot;http://glinden.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Greg Linden&lt;/a&gt; blogs about recommendation systems a lot. He used to have a news recommendation startup(Findory).

Anyway, one point he brought up a LOT about recommendation systems(and this was a general point) is the difference between &quot;dynamic systems&quot; which are more oriented around sessions, rather than assuming I always want more stuff like I have in my long term history.

Anyway, this kinda sidesteps this problem, since you don&apos;t care what people like &quot;in general&quot;, but what they&apos;ve done recently. It also avoids some privacy issues with long term histories. Personalization also sidesteps issues with spamming and gaming the system(#1 on Google is valuable because for a given search, EVERYONE see&apos;s that #1). I&apos;m looking over his posts, but the best ones on this are from 2006 and early 2007(let&apos;s see, here&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://glinden.blogspot.com/2007/08/collective-search-versus.html&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;).

Anyway, I would &lt;b&gt;highly&lt;/b&gt; recommend reading over his older blogs, as he links to lots of research, and lots of implementations(I think he worked on Amazon&apos;s recommendation system for a while, but I&apos;m not sure, I may have just made that up :) ).

He also talks a lot about the issue of novelty as well as gaming systems(after all, if it gets widespread, it will be spammed, I think we would agree there).</body>

			<subject>Junk Mail</subject>
			<event>I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chaseinformation.com/matters/?CELL=66rs&quot;&gt;Chase Freedom credit card&lt;/a&gt;. I use it to buy most of my stuff and the balance is automatically paid in whole from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsbcdirect.com&quot;&gt;HSBC Direct&lt;/a&gt; savings account. I get a bit of cashback and it keeps a larger balance in my savings account. Both of these are negligible bits of money, but who am I do turn down free money?

The one thing that has been irritating me is the huge amount of crap I get in the mail from Chase. They like those promotions which say, &quot;Here&apos;s a check for $20 just for being you (&lt;em&gt;btw, cashing this check enrolls you in our $15/month identity protection program&lt;/em&gt;).&quot;

I sent them a message today saying, &quot;Please leave me alone Chase. I&apos;m tired of having to destroy all the things you send me that are much more attractive to thieves than they are to me.&quot;

They didn&apos;t entirely agree to it, but they said they&apos;d leave me alone for five years or until I changed my address. Not perfect, but I reckon I&apos;ll take what I can get.</event>

				<body>At least you &lt;b&gt;have&lt;/b&gt; a card. They send me tons of crap, and I have no dealings with them at all.

Also, a &quot;wood-chipper&quot; grade paper-shredder that you can chuck whole pieces of mail into is a great tool for eliminating identity theft fodder. Its also a great source of fire-starter material :).

			<subject>Numeracy</subject>
			<event>As I was preparing the last post I looked up a link for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chaseinformation.com/matters/?CELL=66rs&quot;&gt;Chase Freedom credit card&lt;/a&gt;.

The basic idea is that you get the usual 1% cash back on most stuff, and for you top three spending categories you get a bonus 3%. In their description they say: &quot;3% at the top 3 types of places you spend the most each month. There are 15 categories, more than any other card!&quot;

I wonder what percentage of people will realize that the larger the number of categories the smaller the number of things in each division will be. That exclamation point threw me for a minute. It seemed like they were excited about it so surely I should be as well. I think they&apos;re just excited because they now have to give me less money. &amp;#x263A;</event>

				<body>I wonder what percentage of people will be disciplined enough to figure out the categories and have a single use card :).

My parents are not nearly the min-maxer I am, but they have several credit cards and use them strategically for certain purchases(based on discounts or cash-back expected from the use). Particularly if the cards have no annual fee, this strategy can work out well.

Of course, Discover has excellent rewards programs... but you should Google &quot;two cycle billing&quot; to figure out how they pay for it.

First rule of financial dealings: If you don&apos;t understand the deal, Do Not Play.

Second rule: If you don&apos;t know who the sucker is, look in the mirror.

Third rule: There&apos;s ALWAYS a sucker.

				<body>I like those rules. I definitely do not assume there&apos;s such a thing as a genuinely free lunch.

In the case of credit cards, I assume that my lunch is getting paid for by the millions of people who carry a balance at crazy credit card interest rates. Also by the merchants that pay 2.5% of what I give them to the credit card company.</body>

				<subject>Re: When you can snatch your money from the bank young grasshopper...</subject>
				<body>Two Cycle billing is a method of calculating interest. Indeed, carrying a balance is what pays for you and me, who do not. Its best to Google the explanation, but if you have a balance this month, and pay part of it, the payment is not reflected as detracting from the principle + interest until the next billing cycle, so about 30 more days of interest to the principle gets tacked on.

I would not be opposed to outlawing it, even though I tend toward laissez-faire. States used to have all sorts of predatory lending laws(usury, two cycle billing, etc.), but then Delaware and South Dakota won the race to the bottom, taking advantage of the fact that those state laws only apply to companies based in those states.

Part of the problem with credit cards and the laws around them is that credit card companies get a lot of slack to unilaterally change the terms of the contract. Of course, never carrying a balance will keep you safe from most of those, but two-cycle billing is often a surprise to those who find themselves forced to carry a balance by circumstance.

			<subject>Creepiness</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been contemplating and discussing the idea of a pervasive recommender system. I&apos;m find most people find it creepy moreso than intriguing. I don&apos;t know if it would always have been like this, but particularly in this modern age of corporate malfeasance and secret government torture facilities people just don&apos;t trust organizations to act responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll be honest that I don&apos;t necessarily like it all that much myself. It kinda makes me skirmish to guess how much Google knows about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy has been called the ability to pretend to be like everyone else. As a researcher I want as much raw data as possible. What steps can be taken to make people feel comfortable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two main things come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow a complete separation of a person&apos;s recreational and professional personas. If I&apos;m a respected writer by day and dress up in a bunny suit for sexual pleasure at night, privacy is the capacity to keep those two lives separate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the user complete control over their data. At any time if I can see the specific information I have entered into the system from any source and I should be able to modify or at least delete it. If there are derived attributes that is the organizations discretion to disclose. Some dating sites create an emotional stability score. They don&apos;t tell members because having a computer tell you you&apos;re unstable is slightly insulting to many.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</event>

				<body>One thing you forget, particularly in people&apos;s distrust of the government, is the ability of the government to coerce larger organizations(aka Google, Yahoo, et al) to cooperate. So, in some since, its bad for business to spy too much, too bad the government can make you.

In terms of users owning their own data, that is related to the typically European approach to privacy(I &quot;own&quot; data about me), but it does get sticky in this area, since recommender systems are about &quot;lots&quot; of people, and often derived from &quot;side channel&quot; information(what do I click on, how long do I listen to/read something).

Unfortunately, its a complicated issue with few good answers. Greg Linden has written about this too. Also, remember the clickstream/search data AOL released awhile back? And how they found the identities of many people in the anonymized data?

I also have to worry about this in the analysis I do of power usage data.

				<subject>Ownership</subject>
				<body>Are there any schemes for verifying that a particular piece of software is running on a machine? I was thinking that it would be nice if the source was open and you could verify it, sort of what people want to do with voting machines, but I can&apos;t really come up with a way. If software wants to lie, it is difficult to prevent it.

The recent opening of data from Facebook seemed to indicate that people aren&apos;t all that concerned. Though do you remember a while back a company made a site that allowed you to search through all your livejournal posts? It took a person&apos;s username and password and simply scraped the whole thing. The problem was it also  scraped the private entries from their friends and then made those public. There was a bit of a fuss about that.

I think that at the least letting people know what the computer knows would be nice. Giving people control over that is something I don&apos;t know of another system doing.</body>

			<subject>Motorcycles</subject>
			<event>I was driving to DC last weekend going about 70 when a couple guys flew by me on motorcycles like I was standing still.

I&apos;ve been contemplating child rearing as Jenni&apos;s and my relationship gets more serious. I understand for little kids that you can (and given their development need to) rule by fiat. I am the law and you&apos;ll do what I say. For the teenage years though as a child naturally begins to develop their own autonomy the rules need to have a more complex basis. I&apos;ve been thinking of compromises I might come up with.

If my kid decides he or she wants to ride a bike, I&apos;ll agree to it and maybe even buy them one, but only after they&apos;ve volunteered with an emergency response team for three months. I had a friend who was describing to me his experiences having to dig around in the bushes to find a leg that had been slung there from an accident. He said they have a term for motorcyclists: &quot;donors.&quot;</event>

			<subject>Human Computation</subject>
			<event>&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.google.com/video.html&quot;&gt;Google Tech Talk&lt;/a&gt; by  Luis von Ahn titled, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8246463980976635143&quot;&gt;Human Computation&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. His basic idea is creating games that get users to provide useful data to computers, particularly data that computers are bad at producing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first system was &lt;a href=&quot;http://espgame.org&quot;&gt;The ESP Game&lt;/a&gt;. Given an image, two participants not in communication with each other try to guess a word that the other has written down. The best players are going to be guessing words very stereotypical for the pictures which would also likely be good keyword descriptions for the image. Google has since turned this technology into its &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/&quot;&gt;ImageLabler Game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a really creative approach to data gathering that leverages self-interest. His talk also describes a couple other systems: &lt;a href=&quot;http://peekaboom.org&quot;&gt;Peekaboom&lt;/a&gt; and Verbosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;lj-embed id=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verbosity, which is a game to capture simple structured statements about the world, caught my attention because &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanfordfreedman.com&quot;&gt;one of the guys in my lab&lt;/a&gt; is interested in using common sense reasoning (ala the &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmind.media.mit.edu&quot;&gt;Common Sense Project&lt;/a&gt;) to drive behavior-based robotic response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a sufficiently large database is a daunting task. When they were developing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc&quot;&gt;Cyc&lt;/a&gt; they just paid lots of people to sit around asserting things about the world. Successors such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencyc.org&quot;&gt;OpenCyc&lt;/a&gt; have attempted using volunteers on the internet, but they&apos;ve had problems with people poisoning their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It illustrates that the internet is the ideal place for pointless, time-consuming and irritating acts. &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=0k0CAAAACAAJ&quot;&gt;Bruce Schneier&lt;/a&gt; discusses the idea that cryptography isn&apos;t about hiding your data. Other than the one-time pad, all cryptography does is make getting at the data more expensive than the data is worth. In designing online systems that rely on user contributions you can&apos;t make them hack proof. The most you can do is make it extremely time consuming to hack. Unfortunately on the internet when time is money and being irritating is the payoff, people seem willing to spend quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall a slide from one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediacast.sun.com/users/lamere/media/music_recommendation_is_broken&quot;&gt;Paul Lamere&apos;s talks on music recommendation&lt;/a&gt; which mentions a Last.fm tag repeatedly applied to Paris Hilton: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/tag/all+things+annoying+in+the+world+put+together+into+one+stupid+bitch&quot;&gt;all things annoying in the world put together into one stupid bitch&lt;/a&gt;. In some ways that phrase, while nontraditional, is actually better that the deliberate poisoning by tagging Hilton with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/tag/Brutal+Death+Metal&quot;&gt;brutal death metal&lt;/a&gt;. Calling her an annoying bitch is a bit personal and not necessarily pertinent to her music, but it&apos;s arguably true and groups her with other artists that share some set of characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My discussions with my labmate center around a generalization of Ahn&apos;s system. Specifically, how can fundamental needs be leveraged to encourage desired effort. There&apos;s something of a progression up Maslow&apos;s hierarchy as time goes on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs.svg/800px-Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Maslow&amp;#39;s Hierarchy of Needs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was a slave in ancient Rome or Africa, I did work so that the people in charge didn&apos;t kick my ass or kill me. If I was a factory worker 150 years ago I did my work so I wouldn&apos;t starve to death. Increasingly in developed countries social systems are in place to keep me from starving to death. If humanity manages to not do itself in, it is conceivable that the meteoric rise in advancing technology will continue to reduce that lower bound on the effects of not working. The question then becomes, &quot;why work?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question has come up a couple of times already. One of the better known is in the writings of Marx in his famous, &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.&quot; Marx was dealing with a society where people worked for the pure creative joy of production. Whether this would actually hold up is a bit debatable. Russia and Cuba seem to have had a bad time with it, but Scandinavia leans fairly socialist and they are supposedly some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9642.html&quot;&gt;happiest people in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of free labor though is one closer to my own experience: open source software. Programmers develop and improve software out on the web, generally for no direct economic gain. There has been some discussion on the matter and one of the more popular thinkers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://catb.org&quot;&gt;Eric Raymond&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/&quot;&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;, argues that we are transitioning from an exchange culture to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstmonday.org/ISSUES/issue3_10/raymond/index.html#d6&quot;&gt;gift culture&lt;/a&gt; where the basic needs are met for everyone and we are focused more on issues of social status centering not around what you control but what you contribute to the culture at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at different models for what motivates people is important for coming up with the mechanisms to drive enjoyable interface design. I&apos;ve got a few ideas on reasons that The ESP Game is entertaining because of how it relates to pheromone trails, but I need to go get tickets for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secondcity.com&quot;&gt;Second City&lt;/a&gt;, so they&apos;ll have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;</event>

			<subject>10,000 - Serious Spoilers</subject>
			<event>Has anyone told you recently just how cool it is to be a white person? For me personally it had been at least a couple days. I was getting a little insecure in my racial superiority, so I went to see 10,000 BC and it was just the pick me up I needed.

The movie has an awesome scene where they&apos;re introducing all the people that will unite to free their friends and families from the slave traders that tore through their villages. One by one they call out the names of the tribes and show the peoples that happen to live within a days march of our heroes. &quot;Denganeh,&quot; the speaker says as they pan across a group of big angry black guys. &quot;Kurasai,&quot; is greeted with the cries of a bunch of Asians.  &quot;Ghentan&quot; and &quot;Sarwah&quot; get similar reactions from legions of Native Americans and Mexicans. Pretty much everyone made it except the Arabs and that&apos;s because they&apos;re the ones that enslaved everyone else.

Oh yeah, there&apos;s a couple white guys. You need someone to run everything, don&apos;t ya? You might ask, &quot;Why do all these colors of people decide to follow these random strangers that wandered in from over the mountains?&quot; &quot;Do they recognize the purity in their white skins and fall prostrate before them, simply knowing their inferior moral state showing through in the taint of their colored skin?&quot; Oh no, it&apos;s even better than that. These are all primitive peoples; not separated from the land and their souls by the trappings of material society. They know themselves much as animals do: instinctually and without the lies modern man tells himself.

There still exist special wise ones among them who can commune with the gods and know of a greater world. For hundreds of years the gods have been telling them that these white folks would show up and lead them. They take the white folks to see the prophecy painted on the rock and it&apos;s a little stick figure with a white head. (&lt;em&gt;I actually might be making that up, if anyone happens to see the movie again, please watch for that and tell me&lt;/em&gt;.) If all the colored folks today just weren&apos;t so cut off from their spirituality, I&apos;m sure God would tell them that they ought to be following white people as well.

I&apos;ll not really go into much detail since you know what happens when the slave-trading Arabs go up against a couple white guys and their mottled legions of loyal followers. Everyone gets free, but there&apos;s a cool bit at the end where they work God in again. 

The Arabs are led by a mean hateful god. He has them commit human sacrifices at a whim, but apparently has some power since he&apos;s warned them &quot;The Hunter&quot; (the white guy) is coming. (By the end there&apos;s only the one white guy left to be in charge since the other one got stabbed in the back by a dirty Arab.) He does just fine though. He has to invent astral navigation to get them out of the desert, but hey, he&apos;s white, you can&apos;t beat good genes for superior smarts.

So anyhow, at the end there&apos;s the Arab god&apos;s mouthpiece facing down God&apos;s white fighter and his followers. There&apos;s the black leader looking on helpless as the white leader contemplates taking his woman, people and leaving rather than setting them free. Oh, if only he could do something to fight, but unfortunately he&apos;s just a black guy. But, hell, we don&apos;t even have to guess how this works out. It&apos;s god versus God. Think Sparta, except he doesn&apos;t miss.

There&apos;s a bit of a magical moment I&apos;ll not mention in case you have any interest in seeing the film. I will mention though that it was another really nice reminder of the awesomeness of white skin: women. The Arabs have been all over the place collecting slaves. They&apos;ve got the gamut of woman colors from yellow to ebony, but they don&apos;t really care about any of those. How could they? They&apos;ve got a hot white chick.

One is so captivated by the idea of touching her creamy white skin that at the end when everything goes to shit and all hell is breaking out, he doesn&apos;t run away and save his ass; he stays and cuts her loose so he can take her with him. People are dying to the left and right of him, but his poor soiled heart can&apos;t let go of the idea of dirtying her purity. So he throws his safety to the wind and carries her away. Fortunately, even though she&apos;s a woman, she is a white woman and so she just stabs him. He doesn&apos;t even hit her, just falls on the ground dead. That&apos;s to be expected though, white women might need protecting from a white guy, but they can take down a darker person certainly.

So anyhow, go whiteness. If you happen to be white, go see 10,000 BC, it&apos;ll let you know how awesome you are. If you don&apos;t happen to be white maybe you should go see it as well. Perhaps there&apos;s a lesson for you.

(&lt;em&gt;Please no one mistake this for seriousness and show up at my house and shoot me. I know how violent you people can be, and by &quot;you people,&quot; I don&apos;t mean different ethnicities, I mean people without a sense of humor. &amp;#x263A;&lt;/em&gt;)</event>
