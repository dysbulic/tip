    <p>The Tennessee Technological University Education Department is
     migrating their existing paper portfolio system over to an
     electronic one. The shift represents a change in assessment style
     as well as a change in method. Also it is a response to increased
     traceability requirements of accreditors and changes in hiring
     practices. This presentation, given by the system architect,
     deals with the issues motivating the change, the audiences and
     challenges faced in the design and implementation, the final
     structure, and the lessons learned as the system has gone into
     production.</p>
    <p>The presentation will give a brief introduction to the
     educational philosophy and assessment needs that gave rise to the
     system. However, the primary focus will be the architecture of
     the project. The main interface is via the web and is implemented
     using java servlets. The Turbine, Velocity and Torque tools from
     the Apache Jakarta project were used. Those tools and the
     Model/View/Controller design pattern that they
     support dramatically affected the structure of the design. The
     benefits of MVC will be discussed as well the usefulness of
     these particular tools.</p>
    <p>In a system that will be tracking more than 2000 students with
     a storage requirement in the hundreds of gigabytes, scalability
     was an important concern. The division of the file storage,
     authentication, relational database and application components
     will be discussed. In particular there will be an overview of the
     WebDAV/DeltaV extension to HTTP for file storage and a summary of
     the benefits of LDAP for the authentication system.</p>
