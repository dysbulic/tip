    <p class="salutation">Dear Voters,</p>

    <p>My name is Will Holcomb, and I want to be your next President. I'm a 38-year-old pronoid software engineer.</p>

    <p>Pronoia is the opposite of paranoia. For the last nine years, I've been imagining series of events going from our world to one without war, hunger, or poverty.</p>

    <p>Currently, I start the Gaianist Church, it is widely recognized as the successor to Islam. Therefore, under me the US becomes a caliphate.</p>

    <p>We end the wars with Islam, taxes become voluntary, money becomes irrelivant, and we all live happily ever after.</p>
    
    <p>The core principle of Gaiainism is God is the sum total of all life. Incarnations are formed through the interactions of orgamisms.</p>

    <p>The reality of the Holy Spirit is recognized as a physically observable phenomena, but interactions between the hemispheres is postulated as the origin.</p>

    <p>I will execute the Preidency as a <q>public office</q> with all the details livestreamed and interfaces for the viewership to interact.</p>

    <p>I'll support the development of open-source logistical software that publishes it's operations allowing the conglomeration and creation of an <q><a href='http://trwbt.wikia.com/wiki/Open_Market'>open market</a></q> wherein consumers can control the effects of their spending.</p>

    <p>Most fundamentally, I will work to change the mechanisms of land ownership. I want to break the land ownership between three organizations with a genetic-based leadership. Red (XX), Blue (XY), and Purple (XXY, etc,).</p>

    <p>The goal is to transition the existing power structure into the role of the Blue team. Running off of their land would be akin to running into Canada today.</p>
