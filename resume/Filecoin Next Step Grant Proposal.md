### 1. What is your project?

𝔐𝔦̈𝔪𝔦𝔰 spiders an IPFS filesystem (comprehending symlinks) into a Neo4j graph database instance in a tree rooted using the user's ENS name obtained from Sign-In With Ethereum.

𝔐𝔦̈𝔪𝔦𝔰 is a communal “filesystem” which differs from a traditional directory tree in several ways. Resources can appear at multiple paths through the tree *(akin to symlinking)*, and each location resolves to an ordered list of resources. Ideally, *any* coherent path to a resource should resolve to it. Also, selection can be done using a single path or by conglomerating several.

A big feature it will ultimately offer is the ability to easily rename the location of IPFS resouces.

### 3. How is IPFS, Filecoin, or related technology used in this project?

The Neo4j instance stores context about blobs stored in IPFS.

### 4. How will you improve your project with this grant? What steps will you take to meet this objective?

For HackFS, I did a simple app to spider an IPFS filesystem, decode symlinks, and store the structure in a Neo4j instance. There's also an interface for inputting a set of paths and displaying the images at their intersection.

I want to [add a page](//github.com/dhappy/forests/issues/6) giving details about a resource: which paths lead to it, and what the alternatives are for completion.

I'd like for this system to serve as the basis for a proofreading framework. A Git commit history is essentially a blockchain where each commit refers to the previous one. I want to [mimic that structure](//github.com/dhappy/forests/issues/14) in Neo4j and add versioning.

This grant would cover the cost of a few months of Aura, Neo4j's cloud instances which run ~$75 / month at the low end.

Ultimately, I want to use this interface to allow users to create composites from hundreds of thousands of SVGs to design wraps for 13 Cybertrucks which I get to have for a year before they go to the auction winners.

To this end, I want to allow for a structure where a group of images are shown in a conglomerate at higher in the tree, but then it's possible to decompose the image into accessible parts.

### 5. Do you agree to share grant reports upon request, including a final grant report at the end of the three month period?

I do.

### 6. Does your proposal comply with our [Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?

It does.
