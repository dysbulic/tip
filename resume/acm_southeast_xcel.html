    <p>Programming languages are a useful way of communicating
     information to a computer, but there are a variety of situations
     such as software specification testing and machine learning where
     a programming language can be too cumbersome for the intended
     audience. Natural languages involve the interaction of too many
     complex systems to process, but it is possible to come up with a
     "controlled language" subset that can be disambiguated
     systematically. Xcel is a modular system designed to make
     translating between controlled English and prolog flexible and
     easily extensible. This full length student paper deals with the
     characteristics of the xcel system.</p>

    <p>The system is most easily conceptualized as a pipeline that
     takes a document written in Attempto Controlled English (ACE) at
     one end and produces prolog from the other. Each section of pipe
     has a meaningful input and output that is coupled in a generic
     way. These couplings not only make it possible to debug the
     program incrementally, but also make extensions simpler by
     allowing simple splitting points.</p>

    <p>The source of the process is a lexical analysis performed by a
     tokenizer chain loaded dynamically from a tokenizer chain markup
     language (TCML) specification using java reflection. The
     base is a a tokenizer which breaks apart the source based on
     regular expressions into symbolic tokens that have both a type
     and value. This stream of tokens then passes through a set of
     filters that perform secondary operations (discarding whitespace,
     identifying parts of speech, etc.) </p>

    <p>The token stream is fed into a LR(k) parser generated from a
     symbolic Backus-Naur form (SBNF) grammar. SBNF is syntactically
     equivalent to ISO EBNF except that its productions are the token
     types from the token stream rather than characters. As output,
     the parser generates a events for the start and finish of rules
     and the passage of terminals in the parse.</p>

    <p>Cocoon is a framework from the Apache XML project used to
     generate content for the web by passing simple api for XML
     parsing (SAX) events through a set of transformations. The next
     part of the system translates the events from the SBNF parser
     into SAX events and sets them up as a Cocoon "generator".</p>

    <p>Cocoon allows the application of extensible stylesheet
     transformations (XSLT) to the SAX events from the generator. The
     next three parts of the system are XSLT's. The first
     disambiguates the parse tree by performing operations like
     establishing the referents of pronouns and anaphors in a regular
     way. The unambiguous tree is then converted into a XML
     representation of first-order predicate calculus (FOPC) by the
     second XSLT. The third XSLT then converts the FOPC markup into
     ISO prolog.</p>
    
    <p>The separation of concerns in xcel works well. Lexical
     information is captured in the tokenization, then semantic
     information in the parsing. The use of XML in the subsequent
     transformations allows for semantic information to be maintained
     in an easily accessible form. Having only to deal with the parse
     trees makes alterations to the grammar much easier to propagate
     through the system.</p>
