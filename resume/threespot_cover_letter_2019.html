    <p class="salutation">Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

    <p>I am writing in response to the posting from <a href='idealist.org'>idealist.org</a> for a software engineer. I have almost twenty years of development experience in a variety of languages, and am hunting for an opportunity to leverage those skills to do social good.</p>

    <p>There's a quote by Newton about the capabilities of scientists being grounded in the work that came before, and from my time as a Peace Corps volunteer to working with the Marijuana Policy Project, I've sought positions where my labors contribute to the accumulation of human progress.</p>

    <p>I've been a Rails developer for about seven years now. My work has run the gamut from straightforward forms &amp; data collection, to continually running batch jobs correlating the prices &amp; ranks of tens of thousands of products on Amazon, to the conversion of a youth soccer picture sharing application to one for general purpose social networking.</p> 

    <p>Architecturally, my favorite project was Groupdini which utilized API Blueprint to disconnect the development concerns of the back-end from four different web and mobile interfaces. That development was test driven which proved invaluable when doing complex refactoring as well as enabling continuous deployment to staging.</p>

    <p>Javascript-wise, I have been working with it since before the arrival of jQuery. I've done dozens of apps of various complexities from a scheduling system in D3, to a Set-training interface in SVG, to the DHTML conversion of a PowerPoint slideshow highlighting the service of my Peace Corps cadre.</p>

    <p>I loaded Slackware from floppies in ~1997 as my inaugural Linux distribution, and Linux is far and away my operating system of choice. Ubuntu includes code I wrote as parts of both python (multipart post handling) and java (pdf generation) systems.</p>

    <p>If you would like any additional information, please contact me at <a href="mailto:Will%20Holcomb%20%3Cwill@dhappy.org%3E">will@dhappy.org</a> or see my <a href="http://cv.himinbi.org">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> at <a href="http://cv.himinbi.org">cv.himinbi.org</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
