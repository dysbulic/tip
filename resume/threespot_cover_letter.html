    <p class="salutation">Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

    <p>I am writing in response to the posting from <a href='idealist.org'>idealist.org</a> for a software engineer. I have almost twenty years of development experience in a variety of languages and am hunting for an opportunity to leverage those skills to do social good.</p>

    <p>There's a quote by Newton about the capabilities of scientists being grounded in the work that came before, and I've long sought positions that help me build toward a better tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I've been a Rails developer for about seven years now. My work has run the gamut from staightforward forms &amp; data collection, to continually running batch jobs correlating the prices &amp; ranks of tens of thousands of products on Amazon, to the well-architected but ill-conceived conversion of a 

    <p>Architecturally, my favorite project was Groupdini which utilized API Blueprint to disconnect the development concerns of the backend from four different web and mobile interfaces. That development was test driven which proved invaluable when doing complex refactoring as well as enabling continuous deployment to staging.</p>

    <p>Javascript-wise, I have been working with it since before the arrival of jQuery. I've done dozens of apps of various complexities from a scheduling system in D3, to a Set-training interface in SVG, to the DHTML conversion of a PowerPoint slideshow highlighting the service of my Peace Corps cadre.</p>

    <p>I loaded Slackware from floppies in ~1997 as my inaugural Linux distribution, and Linux is far and away my operating system of choice. Ubuntu includes code I wrote as parts of both python (multipart post handling) and java (pdf generation) systems.</p>

    <p>I have a long-standing interest in resource allocation and would very much being a part of helping Optoro both maximize client and consumer satisfaction.</p> 

    <p>If you you need any additional information, please contact me at <a href="mailto:Will%20Holcomb%20%3Cwill@dhappy.org%3E">will@dhappy.org</a> or see my <a href="http://cv.himinbi.org">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> at <a href="http://cv.himinbi.org">cv.himinbi.org</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
