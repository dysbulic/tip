    <p class="salutation">Dear Raj,</p>

    <p>I wanted to drop you a note thanking you for your consideration, and to reiterate my interest in Capterra. It sometimes gets masked in the coporate glitz, but the right software drastically changes how a business can function and Capterra is helping real small busniesses find the right software.</p>

    <p>I was far from satisfied with my perfomance on the programming question, and really didn't feel my true capacities as a developer were reflected.</p>

    <p>If you you need any additional information, please contact me at <a href="mailto:Will%20Holcomb%20%3Cwill@dhappy.org%3E">will@dhappy.org</a> or see my <a href="http://will.madstones.com">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
