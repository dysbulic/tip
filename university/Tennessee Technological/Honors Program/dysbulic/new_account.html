You are probably reading this page because you are on the TTU Honors Program Computer Committee and for whatever reason have been given an account on the developing webserver. This page covers how to out stuff in your account.
<br><br>
You have been given a username and a password. If you haven't then contact <a href="mailto:wjh3957@tntech.edu">me</a> and let me know.
<br><br>
You will be accessing your accoutn via a <b>s</b>erver <b>m</b>essage <b>b</b>lock share, SMB shares were developed by Microsoft and are the type of sharing that Windows uses. For this reason you can access your account via Windows (since Microsoft only supports protocols that they didn't develop reluctantly.) =)

1. Start a dos session. That is start the command prompt; if you don't know how to do that you can type these commands into the run box that you get off of the start menu.
<br><br>
2. Type <b>net use <i>driveletter</i>: \\fb204a-1.honors.tntech.edu\<i>username</i> /user:<i>username</i></b> this will assign your user share to whatever drive letter you choose. For example I would type <b>net use w: \\fb204a-1.honors.tntech.edu\will /user:will</b> and then when I wanted to get to my files I would just save them on the w:.
<br><br>
3. To see your files point your webbrowser at <b>http://fb204a-1.honors.tntech.edu/<i>username</i></b>
