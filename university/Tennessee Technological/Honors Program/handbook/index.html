I have been given the task of rewriting a bit of the honors handbook. Specifically my task is:
<pre>
will, your task, dread though it may seem (i'm really into using parenthetical
expressions today, sorry....), is to familiarize people with the vax.  pretty
much the same things as from last year- with a strong emphasis on logical order
and making sure that they learn what they need to know before they move on to
the next task in that part of the chapter.
</pre>
The chapter as it exists now is <a href="./old_chapter.html">this</a>. In looking at it and following its basic structure it does not seem like there is all that much in it other than the VAX stuff. Here's a brief run down of the chapter as it stands. I think that this onlline version is actually the chapter from two years ago. The mail program that we are backing has now been switched over to pine and that is not in here so there may be other changes. A brief run down of the chapter at this point is:
<ul>
  <li>What the VAX is</li>
  <li>Code of computing practice</li>

I went off yesterday to fall creek falls and had a picnic rather than finishing this work so I've got a bit to do. I did however get a copy of the latest revisions to the chapter and read them and laid out the basics of how I plan to do this chapter.
<br><br>
<a name="proposed_changes">
I plan to:
<ul>
  <li>Remove the section on bbs usage -- The freshman bbs is being switched over to a webboard this coming semester so there is no need for them to know how to use a bbs.</li>
  <li>Change the wording on the rules -- The way that the code of comuting practice is stated now it feels like jackbooted gestapo are breathing down your back. I understand the philosopy of scared straight but I don't think it is necessary for this target audience.</li>
  <li>Multilevel notes -- One of the difficulties about writing this chapter as opposed to others is that, unlike HPEO or HAMS, people reading this chapter will be to varying degrees already introduced to the ideas in it. There will be computer whizzes as well as complete novices. There are a variety of ways to deal with this. The current chapter handles it by speaking to the lowest common denominator and simply not providing any content for the rest of the people. The way that I have seen it handled elsewhere and I personally like this is to write for the middle of the bell curve and then provide definitions for escoteric terms for those behind and also provide above and beyond sections for those ahead. I think that is what I am going to do.</li>
  <li>Structure changes -- I am going to restructure this some for better flow and more logical cohesion. I've got a basic outline which I'll put in later.</li>
  <li>Indexing -- Another change is I think that I am going to format it like a unix HOWTO. There are a set of sections dealing with discrete issues and each is numbered with an index at the front. So if for instance you wanted to know wabout sending mail you would just check the index and go to that number rather than having to scan from the beginning. This will also make for easy hyperlinking in the online version.</li>
  <li>Pictures -- A few extra graphics are needed to make some of what is being taked about more easliy understood. The revised edition has many more graphics but there is still a bit more needed.</li>
  <li>Program support -- Also I am going to make a couple of changes to the honors programs and have the chapter reflect those. I think I'm going to write a generic who.com and a process.com and a getnames.com and include a brief description of those.</li>
</ul>
<a name="proposed_outline">
I think that the outline for the chapter ought to go something like this:
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to the chapter</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Typeface conventions</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>bold</b> type for the actual commands typed</li>
      <li><i>italic</i> type for text that is to be replaced by something by the user</li>
      <li><b><i>bold italic</i></b> for defined terms</li>
      <li><font face="courier">typewriter</font> for the output of the computer</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Noting conventions</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b><i>bold italic</i></b> terms defined in the margin. Marked with a special icon; currently <img src="./definitions_picture" alt="Definition:"></li>
      <li>Grey boxes inserted between sections which are more detailed information that may be skipped by beginners. Marked with a special icon; currently <img src="./above_and_beyond_picture" alt="Above and beyond:"></li>

Just out of curiosity, can I use links to images to acess them. Like I am going to put the tag &lt;img src="./above_and_beyond_picture" alt="Something extra"&gt; here and then in the directory this page is in I'm going to do <b>ln images/little_chilli_pepper.gif above_and_beyond_picture -s</b>. There is no actual image above_and_beyond.gif, only a soft link to chilli_pepper.gif. Lets see if it works.
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="./above_and_beyond_picture" alt="Something extra">
</center>
<br>
Neato, it do. That means that I could have a bunch of images and switch which one was being used just by changing the destination of the link. Right now changing that is essentially as copying and deleting files to change the picture, but this could also let me have a tag like &lt;img src="ab&b_pic"&gt; and link it to some communal pictures directory for the entire webpage. Its kinda mute right now since the webpage is on a VMS server which doesn't (to the best of my knowledge) support symbolic links anyhow. It is neat though.

Ok, I now have a virtual copy of the text for this chapter along with a commandment to make it less than 20 pages all told. It is doable I think. It was initially 16 pages and I am cutting 3 pages of BBS info which is being replaced with the much simpler webboard information.
<br><br>
Wish me luck, I am off to work on <a href="./chapter_draft_1.html">draft one</a>.
