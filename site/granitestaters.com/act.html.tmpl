Candidates who have taken a bad position need to hear complaints, those who haven't taken a position need to be urged to stand up for patients, and those who have taken a supportive stand need to be thanked. Be sure to check the Voter Guide for the latest information on the candidates' positions and records.</p>      <h2>The basics</h2>      <p>In most cases it is advisable to say you want to speak to or leave a message for the state director. It is unlikely you will actually get to speak to him or her, so you will need to give the volunteer who is answering the phone a simple, clear message. If we learn of other specific campaign officials who need to hear from voters, we will note them in the list of campaign contacts.</p>      <p>Be polite and respectful, but firm. Don't yell, even if the person you're talking to is unhelpful or unfriendly. The main point you want to express is simple: The candidate needs to take a clear stand in favor of protecting medical marijuana patients from arrest and jail and for ending federal interference with state medical marijuana laws.</p>      <h2>Some additional talking points</h2>      <p>Medical marijuana is a popular issue. Medical marijuana ballot initiatives have passed in every state that has voted on them. Polls have consistently shown high levels of public support &mdash; 80 percent in a national <cite>Time</cite> magazine poll published on Nov. 4, 2002.</p>      <p><b>For Democrats:</b> The Bush administration has sent Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents with automatic weapons to arrest sick and dying people and their caregivers for using medical marijuana. Democratic candidates should promise to end this cruel war on the sick and to protect medical marijuana patients from the threat of arrest and jail.</p>      <p>With the federal government deep in debt and currently engaged in deficit spending, tax money should be used to pursue violent criminals and terrorists, not medical marijuana patients.</p>      <p>Many otherwise illegal substances, like morphine and cocaine, can be prescribed legally by doctors. The same should be true for marijuana.</p>      <p>Many of the legal pharmaceutical alternatives proposed by opponents of medical marijuana are too expensive, too addictive, and have too many side effects to be good medicine for all patients. </p>      <p>A chemotherapy patient who is too nauseated to swallow a pill or to eat may be able to smoke marijuana for relief. </p>      <p>Ultimately, the decision of which medicine is best for an illness should be left up to a patient and his or her doctor, not to the government. </p>											    <p>When they have their doctors' approval, patients should be able to use medical marijuana without fear of arrest and imprisonment. They should also be able to rely on a safe supply of marijuana, without having to resort to the dangerous illegal market.</p>      <p>Full contact information for each candidate is <a href="office.html">available here</a>.</p>  </tmpl:var></tmpl:template>
