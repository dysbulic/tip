Donation Amount: $[[amount]]

Even though national opinion polling shows that more than 80 million
American adults believe that marijuana should be made "legal" for
adult use, only 22,000 people have ever donated to MPP. Thank you so
much for being one of the few with the initiative, foresight, and
personal commitment to actually do something about our country's
failed marijuana policies.

Your donation will help fund our efforts to end marijuana prohibition.
When -- not if -- the prohibition battle is won, it will be because of
the financial support from members like you.

Once again, thank you for your gift.

Sincerely,
Salem Pearce
Director of Membership
Marijuana Policy Project
