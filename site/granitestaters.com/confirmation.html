<body>
<p>Thank you for your contribution to Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana, a project of the Marijuana Policy Project.</p>

<p>Your Contribution Information:</p>

</ul>

<p>Donation Amount: $<cus cite="">[[amount]]</cus></p>

<p>Even though national opinion polling shows that more than 80 million American adults believe that marijuana should be made "legal" for adult use, only 22,000 people have ever donated to MPP. Thank you so much for being one of the few with the initiative, foresight, and personal commitment to actually <em>do something</em>&#160;about our country's failed marijuana policies.</p>

<p>Your donation will help fund our efforts to end marijuana prohibition. When &mdash; not if &mdash; the battle is won, it will be because of the financial support from members like you.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you for your gift.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
