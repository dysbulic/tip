        <p><span class="oquote">&ldquo;</span>Now the making of a good compilation tape is a very subtle art. Many do's and don'ts. First of all, you are using someone else's poetry to express how you feel. This is a delicate thing. &hellip; The making of a great compilation tape, like breaking up, is hard to do and takes ages longer than it might seem. You gotta kick off with a killer, to grab attention. Then you got to take it up a notch, but you don't wanna blow your wad, so then you got to cool it off a notch. There are a lot of rules&hellip;<span class="cquote">&rdquo;</span></p>

      <p>This site doesn't quite exist yet. When it does I want for it to be a part of a solution for a few problems I have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have 10,000+ songs that are labeled in what could be called an inconsistent mess if one were being generous. They need to be correctly labeled and organized. This includes some system that uses the multi-valued types present in the ID3v2.4 spec. Let It Be Christmas by Alan Jackson is both a Christmas song and a country song as well as an acoustic song. Forcing only one genre for the song is dumb as is forcing only one album and artist.</li>
        <li>I make playlists when planning parties or roadtrips. I would like to be able to remember those and have other people comment on them and suggest songs.</li>
        <li>I want to be able to compare my song collections with my friends and know what songs they have that I don't.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ideally I would like a system where I can establish levels of trust and only share a listing of my library with selected people. Developing that authentication interface will be a task for the next version.</p>
