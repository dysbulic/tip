      <h1>Current AMA Policy</h1>
      <h2>H-95.952 Medical Marijuana</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Our AMA calls for further adequate and well-controlled studies of marijuana and related cannabinoids in patients who have serious conditions for which preclinical, anecdotal, or controlled evidence suggests possible efficacy and the application of such results to the understanding and treatment of disease.</li>
        <li>Our AMA recommends that marijuana be retained in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act pending the outcome of such studies.</li>
        <li>Our AMA urges the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to implement administrative procedures to facilitate grant applications and the conduct of well-designed clinical research into the medical utility of marijuana. This effort should include:
          <ol>
            <li>disseminating specific information for researchers on the development of safeguards for marijuana clinical research protocols and the development of a model informed consent on marijuana for institutional review board evaluation;</li>
            <li>sufficient funding to support such clinical research and access for qualified investigators to adequate supplies of marijuana for clinical research purposes;</li>
            <li>confirming that marijuana of various and consistent strengths and/or placebo will be supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to investigators registered with the Drug Enforcement Agency who are conducting bona fide clinical research studies that receive Food and Drug Administration approval, regardless of whether or not the NIH is the primary source of grant support.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Our AMA believes that the NIH should use its resources and influence to support the development of a smoke-free inhaled delivery system for marijuana or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to reduce the health hazards associated with the combustion and inhalation of marijuana.</li>
        <li>Our AMA believes that effective patient care requires the free and unfettered exchange of information on treatment alternatives and that discussion of these alternatives between physicians and patients should not subject either party to criminal sanctions.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="citation"> (CSA Rep. 10, I-97; Modified: CSA Rep. 6, A-01)</p>

      <h2>H-95.995 Health Aspects of Marijuana</h2>
      <p>Our AMA:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>discourages marijuana use, especially by persons vulnerable to the drug's effects and in high-risk situations;</li>
        <li>supports the determination of the consequences of long-term marijuana use through concentrated research; and</li>
        <li>supports the modification of state law to reduce the severity of penalties for possession of marijuana.</li> 
      </ol>
      <p class="citation">(CSA Rep. D, I-77; Reaffirmed: CLRPD Rep. C, A-89; Reaffirmed: Sunset Report, A-00)</p>

      <h2>H-95.997 Marijuana</h2>
      <p>Our AMA:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>recommends personal possession of insignificant amounts of that substance be considered a misdemeanor with commensurate penalties applied;</li>
        <li>believes a plea of marijuana intoxication not be a defense in any criminal proceedings; and</li>
        <li>urges that educational efforts be expanded to all segments of the population.</li>
      </ol>
