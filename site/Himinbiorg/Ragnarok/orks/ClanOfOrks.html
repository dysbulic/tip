      <p><span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Hail.
The idea of an rp ork clan has been
quite popular to date, and there have so far been 5 interesed people.
What I was thinking for the next step was to formalize the making of
this clan, and put a post out so that people can become aware of our
presence. If we can do this, we can probably grow by at least a few
members by beta release, and once that happens, I am hoping we can get
a beta invite for the clan. If we do that, we basically are promised
power in the real game, as we will have experience, and will have met
new people. If nobody has any objections, I would like to make a public
move within the next week, probably over Thanksgiving break, as I will
have more time then. There are a couple things we will have to go over,
however, before we are ready to make this move, a few things must be
done.</span></p>
      <p><span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">We will
need:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">To
mark some time to in one way or another discuss the clan, be it on AIM,
irc, or anything else.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">A
website. It need not be a domain, though that would be nice. The upside
of a domain is that is hints right there that we are professional, and
we can host things on it. The downside is that it costs money. I am
willing to make a contribution is nobody else is able, but I'm not sure
if it will be enough to get a good webpage up. If sombody knows html
and could make it nice, that would be great. If not, I have a rl friend
who could probably do the trick.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">To
decide on positions, guild
structure, and such. Who will be leader? How will rank work under him?
Will there be an inner council? All these things must be discussed.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">For
people to get to know each other. I have two friends coming online
soon, that will be the fourth and fifth member to this clan. Once they
are signed on, I will send everyone a list of names of clanmates so
that you can all keep in touch.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">To
agree on a name, rp lore, rules, and such.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">It
won't be easy pulling this off, but if we can get through all those
steps, the rest is just getting quality members, which is slow, but not
incredibly difficult if we have the following things accomplished.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">If
anyone has any suggestions, I urge you to speak them now, for this is
the time when they are best heard, and we can incorporate them into the
basis or our clan.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">One last
thing: If you have any friends who
may be interested in a game like this, and don't mind spending a little
time on the boards, talk to them about this. Numbers, though not the
top priority, are very usefull, especially because the more people you
get, the more will want to come, seeing you as a powerful clan.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">With that,
I say....</span><br>
      <br>
      <span class="postcolor" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarg!!!!!!!!</span></p>
