      Doomfire Prehistory - Telling by Irek
    </div>
      <p>Dark was the day I left the former borders of my old clan's territory. I had 
         wandered among the corpses of my family and friends for days before finally 
         coming to the realization that it was time to move on. Why the plague never 
         affected me, still I dont know. I could only drop to my knees and thank Azhi 
         Dahaka that I too was not consumed by the furious evil that took all who I knew 
         and called friend.</p>
      <p>I wandered into the swamps, living off the raw meat of the swamp animals who 
         dared to cross my path. It is said that when an ork reverts to his true roots 
         and turns back to raw meat, he himself becomes almost like the wild animal of 
         his recent past. I can say from experience that this was true for me. I barely 
         remember those days, as they seemed to wash over me without much thought or 
         notice of the passage of time. I remember killing two orks, and even a mahirim 
         with my bare hands, though tbe last left terrible wounds. I was hungry...and a 
         creature consumed with darkness.</p>
      <p>My next clear memory is one day approaching a small clearing in the swamp. I saw 
         an ork fighting a gigantic swamp beast, the kind of which I had tried my best to 
         avoid all my life. I thought for sure at any moment the beast would end the 
         ork's life with one giant swing of its claw, and yet every time I thought the 
         ork's doom was at hand, I was surprised at his agility, strength and pure 
         courage. As I watched this warrior fight, I slowly felt myself regaining my 
         senses and remembering the honor that had once filled me as an ork warrior.</p>
      <p>After what seemed like hours the beast finally fell. The ork himself, exhausted 
         and injured from battle, immediately collapsed into the swampgrass. I made my 
         way carefully towards him, and was not surprised when, upon hearing my approach, 
         he leapt up and brandished his weapon at me. He then noticed the scars and 
         damaged armor which covered my body, lowered his weapon and spoke to me. I, 
         feeling once again as though Azhi Dahaka had placed me on a path of divine 
         providence, offered my hand in friendship, instead of battle, to this brave 
         warrior.</p>
      <p>After a brief talk, Morlem and I ate of the body of the swamp beast, and thus 
         declared ourselves friends. In the next few days that followed, we became blood 
         brothers also, and upon return to the Doomfire encampment, I became friends with 
         the rest of the survivors of the clan and was welcomed back into warrior ranks 
         of my ork brothers....</p>
