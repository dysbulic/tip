  <h1>Doomfire Clan Code of Conduct</h1>
	<p>Here's some of what is expected of you as a Doomfire Clannie!</p>
	<h2>Rules!</h2>
  <ol>
	  <li>Do not whine or harass other characters whether they be in Doomfire Clan or not. Specifically this means 
		  NEVER call someone names just because they kill you. Anyone reported screamming f*g**t! at someone who 
			just beat them will be throttled thoroughly by the entire Doomfire Council.</li>
		<li>Act in the best interest of the Clan. Remember if we all put the clan's wellfare before our own then we 
		  will all benefit in the long run. Good Orks sew the seeds of strong allies.</li>
		<li>No racial slurs</li>
		<li>Quest/Group with known enemies at the risk of death. They can't be trusted AND we can't blame any member 
		  of Doomfire that kills someone they saw helping an enemy. (No vigalante's here either... be sure someone 
			else saw them in the group too/get screenshot if possible)</li>
		<li>No Cheating, Hacking, etc...</li>
		<li>DONT RPK Clannies... Have a <b>*very good*</b> reason before you kill them.</li>
		<li>Do not RPK fellow Orks or Mahirim. Have a <b>*good*</b> reason before you kill them.</li>
		<li>Have fun! If you're grumpy we might hafta kill ya. =)</li>
