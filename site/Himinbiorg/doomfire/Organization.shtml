  <h1>Doomfire Clan Organization</h1>
	<p style=" color:red; font-weight:bold; text-align: center">It should be noted that everything here is tentative, the game not having 
	  been released yet.  =)</p>
	<p class="indent">We specifically designed our organization scheme to allow everyone the potential to advance 
	  in rank. The primary clan will consist only of the <b>Warchief</b> and the <b>Doomfire Council</b>, which will 
		have one representative from each of the subgroups listed below.</p>
	<h2>Subguilds</h2>
  <p class="indent">Each of the subgroups shall have 5 leaders who have proven themselves elite within their area
	  of expertise. In addition to these a number one ranked person from each subgroup shall have a seat on the 
		Doomfire Council and will represent their speciality to the clan as a whole. This player's spot on the 
		Council can only be challenged by one of the 5 elite members of that player's subgroup, who would have to <i>
		defeat the council member 3 out of 4 battles</i>. The specializations are: </p>
  <ul>
	  <li><b>Infantry:</b> Melee Types</li>
		<li><b>Havoc Priests:</b> Offensive Spell Casters</li>
		<li><b>Healers:</b> Healers and Buffers</li>
		<li><b>Cavalry:</b> Any Mounted Specialists</li>
		<li><b>Sneaks:</b> Stealthy Types</li>
		<li><b>Bombarders:</b> Ranged Melee (archers)</li>
		<li><b>Veterans:</b> Defeated or Retired Warchiefs and Council Members</li>
		<li><b>Crafters:</b> Crafty Folk... Challenging rank will not involve regular combat</li>
		<li><b>Mahirim:</b> ...will only be formed when enough Mahirim have joined...</li>
		<li><b>Grunts:</b> Trial Members without specialization, NO Council Representation</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="indent">As you can see the council can potentially have up to ten members, a council representative
	  for each of the subgroups and the Warchief. It should be noted that the Warchief can only be challenged by 
		one of the existing Council Members. For a council member to take the Warchief's position he must first have 
		the unanimous vote of the council for permission to challenge the Warchief, once that is achieved he must 
		then <i>beat the Warchief 3 battles consecutively</i>. If he fails noone may rechallenge the Warchief 
		for 3 months. This will ensure the Warchief's position rarely changes.</p>
	<h2>Dueling for Rank</h2>
	<p class="indent">Challenging isn't a terribly complicated process. If I am an Infantry regular, the only 
	  person I can challenge is one of the Infantry Leaders, and I will have to <i>beat the leader two out of three 
		times</i> to claim the Infantry Leadership position. The person defending their rank gets to choose the 
		time and place of the duel, and they are only obligated to defend their rank once per week, though they may 
		take on as many challengers as they like. If they only challenge one person per week then they should duel 
		the Challenger that most agree is best fit to face the Defender in combat.</p>
  <p class="indent">All challenges must be witnessed by at least one Council Member or the Warchief and 5 other 
	  regular members to ensure fairness. No looting of items is allowed and it must all be honourable with no 
		trash talking. Leaders are strong and honourable not smack talkers.</p>
  <h2>The Parts Form the Whole</h2>
	<p class="indent">Everyone will pay a tax to the main Doomfire Clan which will be used to build our main 
	  city and all cities of the subgroups. The main city will be built first then each speciality specific area will 
	  be built later. The subgroups will have to accept input from the Council on how and where to build their cities, 
	  so as to maximize defensive capabilites and to avoid sloppy cities.</p>
