      Doomfire Prehistory - introduction to the new age
    </div>
      <p>Doomfire was a strong clan that roamed with the reckless abandon of those who 
         know that there is no force that they fear to face. The mention of the clan 
         named "Doomfire" 
         struck terror into the hearts of the elven and human kinds. And indeed, it was 
         no force of the fair folk that eventually ended Doomfire's long, proud tradition 
         of domination in war. It was a plague.</p>
      <p>Much to the delight of humans and elves, a plague swept the region that killed 
         off a majority of the Orks. This plague came to be known simply as the Ork 
         Plague. Only the long-standing alliance with Mahirim kept the humans and elves 
         from wiping out the Orks altogether. This Ork Plague claimed the life of Urk the 
         Smasher, Warchief of Doomfire, and the clan did mourn for a long time. Doomfire 
         Clan had been dealt a strong blow, but in the end it was their hunger to reclaim 
         their previous glory that drove them to move on.</p>
      <p>It was Urk's dying wish that Morlem be declared Warchief and seven days after 
         Urk's death he faced the trials of the swamp and sought guidance from Azhi 
         Dahaka. Morlem returned at dawn of the tenth day after he set out, and with him 
         there was another Ork, a stranger to the clan. His brethren could see a new fire 
         in Morlem's eyes that made them sure their days as a wounded race would not be 
         long.</p>
      <p>They soon learned that the Ork that traveled with Morlem was Irek, and that his 
         clan had made their home deeper in the swamp and had been hit harder by the 
         plague. Irek told a horrowing tale of watching his entire clan die to the 
         plague, and wondering at why he never even got a little sick. He had heard of no 
         other Orks who were completely immune to the plague and knew it was a sign from 
         Azhi Dahaka that his purpose had not yet been fulfilled, but he had no idea what 
         that purpose might be until he and Morlem had met on a desolate marsh plain deep 
         in the heart of Morak.</p>
      <p>Morlem declared that very night that he would form a council of three to rule 
         over the Clan. Morlem was, of course, the first of the three, and Irek was to be 
         the second. Normally the Orks would have challenged Irek as an outsider to the 
         clan, but they could see that any such challenge would have been foolhardy as 
         well as suicidal. Azhi Dahaka had clearly granted Irek a strength and vision 
         that was not to be taken lightly. There was oddly enough no third declared. Most 
         of the Orks correctly understood this to mean that someone would have to prove 
         themselves worthy before they could be on the council.</p>
      <p>And thus... a new age begins.</p>
