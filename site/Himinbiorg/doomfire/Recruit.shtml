  <h1>Doomfire Wants You!</h1>
  <h2>Reasons to Join Doomfire</h2>
    <ul>
	    <li>You are willing to have fun, work, and <b>succeed</b> as a team.</li>
			<li>You want to be <b>rewarded</b> for the effort you put in to developing your character.</li>
			<li>You think Orks are the cooler than sliced bread.</li>
		</ul>
  <h2>Temporary Recruitment Policy</h2>
    <p><b>Right now if you want to join up hop over to the forums and introduce yourself.</b></p>
	  <p>This is how we are going to handle recruitment for the time being since the game hasn't been released yet. 
	     We will let whoever wants to join in as Grunts.  If we get to know you better in the interim or if you 
		   exhibit a lot of initiative we may find it appropriate to promote you to a more prestigious position. I'm 
  		 not going to ask anyone to choose their speciality before the game is actually release. Also <i>know that as 
	  	 a grunt your position in clan is in no way certain</i>, you will either have to prove your worth and be promoted 
		   or get kicked out altogether.</p>
