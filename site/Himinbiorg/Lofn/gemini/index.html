    <h1>Stephanie Horne</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my world!!</p>
    <p>This used to be my Math 101 webpage but that class has come and gone. But I have decided to leave up a few of the elements of that class that did interest me. Well now that I mention it the remaining math sites here were the only that interested me:). So I left the Sierpinski Gasket and my Mandelbrot picture and also my spiral- so enjoy! I'm hoping to soon have a page up with my poetry on it to display a little bit of my artistry (if you can call it that) for all you nice people who have decided to visit my little home on the web.</p>

    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>Art contains many applications of mathematics.For instance, Fractal Art is very popular now. You can create beautiful fractal pictures using the laws of self-similarity and recursive replacement.For more information into the world of fractals and the game of Chaos visit <a href="http://www.iglobal.net/pub/camelot/chaos/chaos.htm">Fractal Information!!</a></p>
    <p>Have you ever watched "Jurassic Park" and wondered what in the world Jeff Goldblum's character was talking about when he mentioned chaos mathematics? Well I did! Go to <a href="http://mgw.dinet.de/physik/ChaosSpiel/ChaosEnglish.html">UTTER CHAOS</a> and watch the Sierpinski Gasket appear before your eyes!!</p>

    <h3>Love</h3>
    <p>Love truly is an amazing thing. On June 25th, 1999, I sent a harmless little e-mail to Will Holcomb asking for computer help. I was wanting to put my schedule on my plan file. I had seen his plan file and wondered how he had done it. Little did I know at the time that I was about to e-mail a computer genius. But anyway, he answered my question and a few others that I hadn't asked. And from then on we started corresponding via e-mail. It was wonderful. We discussed everything from politics to sexuality to movies. Then on July 8th (don't ask me how I remember these dates- b/c its even a mystery to me) I finally met him face-to-face. I remember instantly loving his smile. We went to see "Shakespeare in Love" that night. After the movie we talked outside my apartment for nearly two hours. That was over eight months ago. I love him so. He is an amazing man. However, he frequently beats up on me and I, of course being about fifty pounds smaller than my hunk of a man, can do nothing but tickle him- which I do quite often. Its so funny to watch him "try" not to laugh- it never works:)</p>
    <p>Love makes you feel so alive, so free. So savor every moment. Treasure every kiss. Love writes poetry on your heart and in your soul.</p>
