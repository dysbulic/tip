<p>It's time to update this page seeing as how my internship at <a href="http://www.whnt.com">WHNT</a> ended last summer. It was a great time had by all and I really enjoyed my time there. As long-ago promised, I have scanned some of my photographs  from my many adventures around the country. I am such the world-traveler. Yes, sophisticated lady am I. </p>

<p>For those of you who are not versed in Norse mythology you are probably wondering just who was this Lofn character. Lofn was the goddess in charge of sparking passionate love. And with the permission of Odin she could even marry individuals who were once forbidden to wed. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<p>In May of this year, my best friend (Janet) of too many years to mention decided to move to California. For her birthday (May 9, send presents!), all she wanted was for me to accompany her to L.A. for a week before she moved to her more permanent location in northern California. It was my first time on a plane and probably so far my best vacation ever. Here are some pictures from the trip, complete with witty commentary.</p>

<p>This is Janet and I in downtown L.A., just chilling in the California sun. If you look closely you can see the famed Hollywood Sign in the background between us.</p>

<p> No trip to LA-LA Land would be complete without a stroll down the Walk of Fame. Here you see three Hollywood icons.</p>

<p>On the third day of my trip, we all headed to San Diego. And what do you do in San Diego? Well, if you are a tourist, you visit the over-priced, but very nice SeaWorld. The dolphins wanted nothing to do with you if you didn't have fish to feed them. However, if you had fish, you were their new best friend. Here Flipper, Echo, whatever you would like to call him is all too accomodating, after we fed him, of course.</p>
