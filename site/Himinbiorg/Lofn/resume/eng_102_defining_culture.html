<h2>Defining Culture</h2>

<p>What is culture? Is culture a form of dress or a language? Is culture part of the physical or mental aspect of body, or both? Can culture be defined as a feeling or an idea? To me, culture is everything that makes up a specific group of people from a specific region. As a whole, often when people think of culture they also think of stereotypes, which may or may not describe a particular culture. For instance, Americans are thought of as blue-jean wearing cowboys by most foreigners. This notion, while innocent, also categorizes the society as a whole. Categorizing a group leads to stereotypes, stereotypes lead to ignorance and ignorance leads to prejudice. For example, Native Americans are seen as dancing around, in full headdress, while chanting a sacred prayer. Once again, yes this does still happen, but not as often as portrayed.</p>

<h3>Geertz's Notions</h3>

<p>Clifford Geertz, in his essay "Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight," uses a series of cockfights to describe the culture of Bali. On the surface, one might see the Balinese as brutal, disrespectful, and greedy. Who ever heard of someone using such a vile act to describe a group of people? However, Geertz is smarter than this. Geertz states that "the cockfight is not the master key to Balinese life, any more than bullfighting is to Spanish. What it says about that life is not unqualified nor even unchallenged by what other eloquent cultural statements say about it." Geertz uses the cockfight to tell how deeply rooted this society is, in togetherness and tradition. His study was used as an introduction into the world that is Balinese culture. The Balinese consider the cockfight as a way of life and as an art form. It is this act that binds the culture together and helps the Balinese to hold on to their heritage. While we may not completely understand their way of life, most of us can respect their customs and, possibly learn something about ourselves from them. This respect is important to all cultures in order to be tolerant and understanding. We have to respect others before we, ourselves, can expect respect.</p>

<h3>Our Exhibit</h3>

<p>We, as students at Tennessee Technological University, tried to show our own culture through an exhibit at school. Three objects were to be chosen that reflected our goals, interests, and experiences as students and young Americans living in the last few years of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>These objects brought our lives together. Yes, we were all connected before, but we did not know why. Through the exhibit, each one of us could see part of ourselves in someone else. In the exhibit, groups started to form. Themes became prevalent throughout the class. These themes made it clear that although we try our best to be individuals, Tennessee Tech students in one way or the other group off into sections: the dedicated students, the family-centered, religious students, and sports players who have their own attitude and lingo.</p>

<h3>Spirituality at Tech</h3>

<p>Religion is the foundation for the ideals and values of our country, our government, and most of our families. Several students set out to explain what religion means to them and what it gives to them in their lives. Three students out of the class brought Bibles to show their strong faith. Matthew Bissinger brought his and said, "I pray that all man can see my love for God." Another classmate, Candy Reeser brought along her Bible and said her "Christian faith means the world to her." These objects exemplified the students powerful beliefs and values. Religion is a source of strength for many Tech students. Most know that they can rely on their faith, no matter what the struggle, to show them the way and comfort them. All of us want something to believe in, we want to know that someone is watching over and protecting us. This holds true even with those who do not belong to a particular religious group. Various religious groups around campus offer a way for students to communicate with each other and share their faith. Greg Tershansy, in his commentary stated, "I enjoy participating in events that glorify the Lord. I also meet many other people that have the same religious interests that I do." Not only is this communication good for the soul but also for the heart.</p>

<h3>Family Support Systems</h3>

<p>Family is a support system for most everyone. Rachel Bullington spoke of her family and commented that, "Without them, life would be like a roller coaster ride that you could not share the excitement with anyone, but yourself." Family is our connection back to the way life once was, before we were men, women, and students, back to a time when we were simply sons and daughters. Lori Apple states a feeling that is mutual for many students, "Without my family, I would be lost." From pictures to Cindy Steward's rose representing her grandmother Rosa, whom she lovingly calls the "backbone of her family", it is evident that our class as a whole very much respects and loves our families. Eight out of twenty students brought in pictures of relatives or another object of our affection, boyfriends or girlfriends. Kristie Gaitan expressed that her boyfriend, Ron Hees, gives her " an incentive to succeed with her life." Our culture as a whole wants someone to love and someone to give that love back. Love and family are our support, strength, hopes and dreams.</p>

<h3>Sports and Their Affect on Our Lives</h3>

<p>Sports is also a strong theme in our American culture. Sports show athleticism, leadership, and coordination. Athletes must be very disciplined and dedicated to succeed in their sport. Sports gives its participants more confidence and self-assurance. Seven out of twenty students in the exhibit brought in sport-related objects that they felt expressed something about themselves. Adrienne Fortmann brought in softball medals, along with Chris Reid who used a high school football award to help describe himself. These were not brought in to flaunt the athlete's talents, but as a symbol of pride and accomplishment. Jeff Owens talks in his commentary about sport's relaxing benefits: "It is a way to get away from everything and just blow off steam if I am feeling bad or to get my mind off of things. It is just a great release for me." For many students here at Tech, sports is not just a way of exercise, but also a way of getting an education and meeting new people. For instance, Brandon Flatt, a freshman on the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles basketball team, stated "Basketball has given me the chance to make new friends, tour the world, and find out who I really am. This sport has probably played the biggest role in my decision to attend Tennessee Tech." Athletes train hard and work hard to keep up their grades and their game. Andy Stephen said, "One thing it [baseball] has taught me is to work hard with others to succeed in whatever you are doing."</p>

<h3>Hard-Working Underclassmen</h3>

<p>Dedication goes hand in hand with college. Most college students know that it is only hard work that will lead to the American dream of a college diploma and a high-paying, satisfying job to go along with it. Two students stood out as dedicated students, one was Southida Sengsayadeth. Southida one day aspires to be a registered nurse, but she knows that it will take hard work and commitment to achieve that dream. She admitted to letting her grades slip last semester and knew that she would have to work harder to stay more focused. Rachel Bullington told how for two years she has worked hard at Smith's Pharmacy, filling prescriptions, and compounding drugs. Rachel expressed in her commentary her feelings about her job, "This hard work is a part of me, therefore I could not leave it out of the exhibit." She brought along the mortar and pestle to prove it. Many students strive for academic excellence in order to not only please themselves but also their family or significant other. Mark Connolly replied, "I know that if you care about anyone else then you must pay attention to your classes." Amanda Reed chose a picture of her boyfriend and stated, "He tells me how important school is to my future." We not only want to succeed for ourselves, but also for the people that we love. We want others to be proud of us and of our work.</p>

<h3>Impact of the Exhibit</h3>

<p>All of the objects were different. Each object had a special meaning and in some way or another let us glimpse into the hearts and minds of our fellow classmates. Bad judgments made by a first glance were changed, or at least reconsidered through the exhibit. The objects although small, had a big impact on our minds as a whole. I felt connected to people that I otherwise would not have gotten to know, if it had not been for this exhibit.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts </h3>

<p>Geertz explained in his essay that we can all identify with one another if we try. It is the similarities that bring us together, but the differences that set us apart and make life interesting. We all feel like Geertz did at one time or another, like we are gusts of wind or invisible to others. I feel like until I take the time to get to know someone. The majority of us are afraid to speak up, or stick our necks out, until we know someone better. Adrienne Fortmann said it best in her commentary by stating, "I figured if someone could relate to the type of person that I am, then we would not have to feel awkward." Our culture only begins to tell how we are as a society. Culture is merely an introduction into our lives, which, even though we may not realize it, we are very much connected. Every culture has pride. This pride is evident from the way the Balinese articulate their cockfighting, to the way, we, as Tech students, wear our teams colors. Every culture wishes to succeed and every culture works hard to succeed. The Balinese work hard to hold on to tradition, just as, we, as students, work hard to stay afloat in fast and furious waters of stress, grades, love, and the act of growing up.</p>
