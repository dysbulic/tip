<h2>Honors students attend conference</h2>

<p>A group of 20 Honors students are spending this week in Orlando, Fl., for the annual National Colligate Honors Conference (NCHC).</p>

<p>This year's theme is "Worlds of Imagination." The conference is running from October 27-31. Student Monies Allocation Committee (SMAC) donated $4800 for the event and the Associated Scholars' Committee (ASG), through fund-raisers and activities, donated $1300. The Honors program itself earned $300 for the conference expenses.</p>

<p>"It's always fun. The conferences are very educational. It is neat to be able to see the way that other schools run their Honors programs," said Melissa Phillips, who is attending her fourth conference.</p>

<p>All students attending the conference will be making some type of oral presentation, either in panel discussions or through the presentation of student papers.</p>

<p>The conference this year will include one new event: an evening of original student films. Other events include a presidential luncheon and a featured performance by soprano soloist Sofie Van Lier followed by a voice master class for students.</p>

<p>Various academic forums and debates are also being presented on topics ranging from education in the 21st century to protecting the world's oceans. Two TTU students, Christopher Berry and Alex Brooks are scheduled to speak at the student forum.</p>

<p>Many speakers are being featured, including Dr. Carl Safina, director of the Audobon Living Oceans Program and the President of Disney Regional Entertainment, Arthur Levitt, III.</p>

<p>But it's not all work. Students will explore Cape Canaveral and Disney World as a part of the conference's City as Text program, along with a historical tour of Orlando. Saturday night there will be a pool party for the students to enjoy.</p>

<p>"It's definitely a sharing experience. It's neat to be able to teach professors new ways to teach their programs in their schools," said Phillips.</p>
