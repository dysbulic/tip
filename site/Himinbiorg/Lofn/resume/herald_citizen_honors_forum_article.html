<p>The Tennessee Tech University Honors Program recently hosted an Honors Forum on the Peace Corps and invited many esteemed guests from Cookeville who have served as Peace Corps volunteers throughout the world.</p>

<p>In attendance were Bonita Barger, a Vanderbilt University professor; Diane Glasgow, a kindergarten through fifth grade teacher of Spanish at Heavenly Host Lutheran School; TTU English professor Caroll Viera; and Mike Doughty, who was the first Peace Corps volunteer from Putnam County.</p>

<p>Each recounted their experiences with the Peace Corps: what led them there, why they wanted to help and what they learned from their experiences.</p>

<p>According to Barger, "Twenty-five years ago it was a role reversal and I was sitting in an audience listening to a gray-haired person talk about their work as a Peace Corps volunteer."</p>

<p>She found herself not ready to settle down and go to work. Barger wanted to do something a little risky; she wanted an adventure. She also wanted to travel and get a better sense of the world, but also she wanted to help.</p>

<p>Barger, along with her husband, was sent to the Latin America country of El Salvador, where they worked from 1977 to 1979. In El Salvador she worked on woman development projects, and her husband worked in the mountains collecting insects. She described the experience as "hard to get out of my blood." The vibrancy of the experience shone on her face as she recalled teaching one of the marketwomen she worked with how to add.</p>

<p>Caroll Viera had always wanted to visit Africa. As a child she had even had a pen pal from Nigeria. Throughout her life the words of Kennedy had been important to her: "Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country." She was not ready to go to graduate school after college, so she signed up for the Peace Corps and was sent to Nigeria, where she served from 1965 to 1967.</p>

<p>In Nigeria, Viera was a teacher at a girls' boarding school. She described her housing as "pretty privileged" because the school's staff housing had the "luxuries" of running water and electricity for four hours a day.</p>

<p>Viera learned only a bit of the African language during her stay. The national language of Nigeria is English, and "most of the people I worked with spoke fluent English, and I never had to depend on the African language," said Viera.</p>

<p>According to Diane Glasgow, "I first wanted to visit another country when I was in fifth grade and a foreign exchange student spoke to our class about South America. Then, when I was in high school, I joined the AFS (American Field Service) club, and my best friend was selected to go. Only one person from our high school could go.</p>

<p>"I wrote the Peace Corps and told them, 'I want to join the Peace Corps.' I was just out of high school and they told me that I needed a college degree in something they could use like business, education or agriculture. I completed my bachelor's degree in three years, specializing in elementary education. At the time, in 1972, there were no teaching jobs so I applied to the Peace Corps."</p>

<p>Glasgow did not receive her country choice of Africa, but she did receive her second choice: Asia. She was stationed in Thailand, where she was in charge of training English teachers.</p>

<p>"I was responsible for all the English majors and minors and all the general education students. It was a wonderful opportunity. I was training 11th and 12th graders as well as freshman and sophomores in college with just a bachelor's degree. In this country, you must have a Ph.D. to train teachers. So, I was stretched professionally, but it was a wonderful opportunity. If you have any interest in traveling, it's a great idea," said Glasgow.</p>

<p>Mike Doughty felt his call to service the Saturday following President Kennedy's assassination.</p>

<p>"I had never taught in a classroom. I had never been on a court. I had not been north of Frankfurt, Kentucky. But I knew I wanted to make a difference," said Doughty.</p>

<p>Soon he found himself in Venezuela doing just that; teaching and helping.</p>

<p>"I will never forget it. I still communicate with some of my students. I would not take anything for these experiences. If you decide to do it, it will probably be the greatest experience of your young lives," Doughty told the students at the forum.</p>

<p>However, it was not always a wonderful experience. There was a culture shock, different climate and thousands of bugs, not to mention revolutions that the volunteers contended with during their work.</p>

<p>"Every day I thought of turning back. For six months I cried every day. I was homesick. I missed television. I missed chocolate. But I kept telling myself, 'Okay, if it is not better in two weeks I'll go home.' And it always got better," recounted Barger.</p>

<p>While Viera was in Nigeria, a civil war erupted and America tried desperately to evacuate its people from the country.</p>

<p>"Luckily, none of the volunteers were harmed, but some of them did see some of their own students chased down and killed," said Viera.</p>

<p>Thailand went through a revolution and suffered a media blackout while Glasgow was volunteering. She had to leave the country just to find out what was going on in Thailand. When she returned, Thailand was under a new king and a new government. "It was incredible," she said.</p>

<p>In addition to major world events, the volunteers also experienced other dangers during their tours.</p>

<p>"Some of the cockroaches I would step on would just turn and look at me and walk away," recalled Barger. And Glasgow added, "I used to scare the lizards away from my room until I found out they ate mosquitoes -- then I invited them back in."</p>

<p>Even through the sweltering heat, the fearsome insects, the homesickness and the political uprisings, these four have nothing but good words to say for their experiences. The Peace Corps does truly seem to live up to its slogan: "The toughest job you'll ever love."</p>

<p>"You do it because you will make an impact. I did not think that I could change a whole country, but I did think that I could change a few students' lives. The whole world is waiting for your skills," said Glasgow.</p>

<p>The Peace Corps hopes to double their number of volunteers over the next decade. For more information on the Peace Corps Organization, visit the website <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov">www.peacecorps.gov</a>.
