<h2>Honors Forum October series begins with work of the Peace Corps</h2>

<p>The Honors forum series continues in the month of October, highlighting the work of the Peace Corps.</p>

<p>Several speakers have been invited to the event to be held Oct. 14 during dead hour in the OVC Room of the Roaden University Center. They will share life experiences as well as information on how to join the Peace Corps.</p>

<p>One of the speakers will be Bonita Barker of Vanderbilt University. Barger, along with her husband worked for two years in El Salvador for the Peace Corps. She found it difficult to get the experiences out of her system, so she continued her work as an independent consultant and for seven years she helped train staff and volunteers to work overseas.</p>

<p>"My years as a volunteer were a transforming experience. I connected with people, landscapes, and value. Martin Buber called it the 'man to man experience' - connection between one person and another. What the Peace Corps showed me is that individuals can cut through race, geography, language, culture, and religion. The boundaries disappear and distinctions between who I am and who others are dissolve and merge into one. I have developed 'global glasses' allowing me to see humanity from different lenses," said Barger.</p>

<p>Also speaking will be Virginia Viera, a TTU English professor. Viera served as a volunteer in Africa for the Peace Corps as well.</p>

<p>After several students had shown an interest in possibly joining the Peace Corps, Connie Hood, director of the Honors Program, tried to get an expert to come speak with them about the topic.</p>

<p>"We have lots of workshops in Honors on topics requested by the students. This one, it seemed to me, was of interest to the whole TTU community and the whole town too," said Hood.</p>
