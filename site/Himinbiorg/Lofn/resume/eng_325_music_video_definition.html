<h2>The Music Video</h2>

<p>A music video is a short movie-like interpretation of a song which an artist uses as both a form of entertainment and as a promotional tool to showcase their new or latest single. Videos tie the music in with scenes which evoke emotion or leave the audience with a lasting impression of the artist or the song.</p>

<p>Music videos have been in existence since the early eighties when an entire channel was devoted to them: Mtv, which stands for music television. Since their creation, the focus has shifted from merely a tool for entertainment to an artistic way of introducing new bands to their public. Artists who are having difficulty getting their music played on radio stations might find their success with this television medium instead. Plus videos are sometimes released weeks before the song in which it portrays makes it to radio airwaves. If a video does become popular it usually affects how much it is in fact played on the radio and in turn will impact record sales. One of the most important aspects of a music video is that combines sight and sound, allowing the watcher to form an instant connection from the picture to the song. For instance, one might not remember much about "What's My Age Again?" by the band Blink 182, but he/she would remember all the band members running naked through the streets in the video.</p>

<p>Music videos generally are divided into two categories, performance-based or concept-based. A performance video is just that, the artist is shown performing their song in a variety of eye-catching settings. These settings may vary from such diverse places as an insane asylum in Korn's "Make Me Bad" to a desert in Shania Twain's "That Don't Impress Me Much." Sometimes, these videos are filmed at concerts where large masses of people gather to hear the artist perform their music for the price of a ticket. The singer/ singers might perform a crowd-pleasing hit and the audience's reaction to it will become their next video as a way of showing the energy behind the song .</p>

<p>Concept-based videos take on the meaning behind the song. If the single is about a break-up of a relationship then it might feature clips of a couple fighting or saying their goodbyes. Another example is Christina Aguilera's video, "I Turn To You," where a young woman has a terrifying car accident while driving in the rain. She is scared and rushes home to be comforted by her mother. The song's theme is about a love in which people can lean on each other in times of struggle and need and that theme is shown throughout the video. However, some videos do not in any way follow the motif of the single yet are still entertaining. An example of this is by the group, Fastball, and their video, "Fire Escape." The song deals with unmet expectations but the video is about a day in the life of a young Fastball fan getting ready for work. Only she is not the average fan because she has killed all three members of the group and is hiding their bodies in her home. Some videos, like the above, are very creative and do not follow the song's theme but do flow well within themselves. </p>

<p>With that being said, it is also important to mention that most videos are a mixture of both concept and performance. The video might be about the birth of a child and interwoven with the images of the event will be scenes of the artist singing. For example, 'NSync's "Its Gonna Be Me" features the band members made up like plastic dolls in boxes of a toy store but also contains a high-energy dance number in addition to their singing.</p>

<p>While the average video runs from three to four minutes, some are longer adding to their cinematic quality. Two classics come to mind: One is Michael Jackson's video for "Thriller," which runs for over 10 minutes. This early video has become a standard by which all others are judged. For example, every few years a group or individual artist which have shown creative genius in this field are awarded the Mtv Michael Jackson Video Vanguard award. "Thriller" is a concept-based video about a group of ghouls who come out at night and prey upon a frightened Michael Jackson and his girlfriend. Another long video is the Guns and Roses classic nine-minute-long tale of love gone bad, "November Rain."  Also concept-based, it follows a young couple from their wedding day, through trials and tribulations to the wife's untimely death, with elements of rain mixed in from beginning to the end. Most videos that are longer do have to follow a story in order to capture the attention of an audience which would be harder to maintain through minute after minute of simple performance footage.</p>

<p>Music videos from their inception nearly twenty years ago have grown into their own art form. Award programs, countdowns and request shows as well as channels, are all devoted to them and their wide appeal to young and old alike. Whether their format is country or pop, performance or concept-based, music videos and their popularity grow with each new release.</p>
