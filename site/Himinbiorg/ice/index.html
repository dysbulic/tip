<body>
<p>This is the homepage for the Intelligent Collaborative Entities (ICE) project which is a research group operating as a part of the Software Automation and Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) at <a href="http://www.tntech.edu">Tennessee Technological University</a>.</p>
<p>The ICE project attepts to deal with two major issues that are becoming more prevelant as the rate of technological expansion increases. One is that the vast majority of work being done in computers and technology currently is not in the creation of new systems but rather in the maintience of existing systems. Another effect of the rapid expanse of technology is the proliferation of new technologies, be they new hardware devices such as intelligent appliances or new developments in software, then end affect is that software engineers are forced to choose between the stability of tested technologies or the extensibility of new systems.</p>
<p>The basic concept behind the ICE project is creating mechanisms to imbue software components with a degree of self-knowledge and the capacity to communicate their capacities using structured knowledge manipulation mechanisms from artificial intelligence and thereby create software that is more robust and adaptable to the rapidly changing world of technology.</p>
<p>The project is currently focusing on research in distributed architecture systems and structured knowledge manipulation. As that work progresses we will be posting a series of short papers about several existing technologies; what issues they address, how they do so, and what are the positive/negative aspects are in relation to this project.</p>
<p>The technologies under consideration now are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kqml/">Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/">Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cyc.com/tech.html">Cyc/CycL</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sun.com/jini/overview/index.html">JINI</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.asp">Component Object Model (COM)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.omg.org">Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I will put project information here soon; I have a bit more reading to do first. For the time being; contemplate the sunset.</p>
