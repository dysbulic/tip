            <p>I consider myself to be a gentleman. I would like to
            take long walks on the beach with that special someone,
            and discover their hidden beauty that lies within. I enjoy
            candlelit dinners and red wine. I spend my free time
            writing poetry and reading books that help me get in touch
            with my emotions. My favorite movies are Return to Me and
            anything with Sandra Bullock. I would love to go shopping
            with my special someone and hear about their day, as I'm
            more of a listener than a talker. I'm not afraid to cry,
            and my favorite animal is the kitten, because they're just
            so cute and cuddly.</p>

            <p>I am looking for a girl who is into binge drinking and
            hardcore sex. Light S&amp;M/B&amp;D is a necessity, as I am
            a bad, bad, naughty boy who needs to be spanked. I need
            someone to humiliate me and make fun of my small genitals.
            If you are interested in inflicting pain, then holding me
            and telling me mommy isn't mad anymore, send me an
            email.</p>
