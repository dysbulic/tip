      <p>I've got some elements that aren't wrapping correctly in IE.</p>

        <h1>Left Floated Block</h1>
        <p>There is a block floated to the left of this content that this text should wrap under. Well, assuming that this text is of sufficient length to warrant wrapping. That is that it is longer than the height of the element to the left. Given my propensity for logorreahic non-sequiters, this should be easily possible. I'm more than capable of expounding on a variety of fascinating topics. I'm quite in demand for dinner parties actually. I'm much like one of those unicycle-riding bears. Save that I'm not ursine and I lack essentially all coordination.</p>
        <p>Dammit all, this is working here, but not in my other page. IE is such a bitch&hellip;</p>
