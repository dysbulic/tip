    <p>This page demonstrates a bug in mozilla as of 1.3a. The form
     above contains a div into which an unordered list is inserted via
     javascript at load time. When the button is clicked it will jump
     down (along with anything else on the page) about an eigth of an
     inch and not do anything. When it is clicked a second time it
     does the submission.</p>
    <p>The click needs to be at the top of the button in the part that
     is not overlapped with the moved button or it will work
     correctly.</p>
    <p>If the button is tabbed to the space bar will cause it to go on
     to the next page. Resizing the screen causes it to redraw
     correctly.</p>
    <p>As to why insert an empty &lt;ul&gt;, this script is part of
     one that builds a list dynamically as part of a webapp and the
     empty &lt;ul&gt; keeps the page from validating. (Validation
     being one of the unit tests.)</p>
