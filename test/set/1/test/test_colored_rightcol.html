          divs. You want the width as a percentage of .layout, but it is computed
          as a percentage of .contentholder.
         So first you find the width of content holder: 100% - 25% - 30% = 45%
         So you want to solve this: x / 25% = 100% / 45%; x = 55.55...%
         There's also a 2% margin on everything.

    <p><em>I had my <a href="test_css_table_display.html">earlier bug</a> invalidated. I was confused about how the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/tables.html#height-layout">height of table cells</a> is computed. Specifically how non-line boxes push the baseline down. </em></p>
    <p>I'm having a hell of a time trying to make a three column layout where the heights of the three columns match. I've got the <a href="../shadow_body/">basic premise</a> worked out, but what I think are <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=337624">layout bugs in Firefox</a> are screwing everything up. Essentually, any time there is a <code>table</code> in any of the columns, the other columns will have a border the height of that column at the top. So, what I am trying to do is have a layout which uses <code>table-cell</code> as a <code>display</code>, but no table has more than one cell with content in it.</p>

    <div class="layout">
      <div class="contenttable">
        <div class="navback"></div>
        <div class="contentholder">
          <div class="nav">This is the navigation bar. Links and stuff go here to let people navigate yo.</div>
          <div class="jump">This is the right column. It has jump points for different areas of the site.</div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Some test content outside of the table.</p>
            <table><tr><td>This is the actual content. It is in a table because I can't keep the <a href="http://www.kintera.org">retarded <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym></a> from sticking the tags in the output. (And to be fair, I also have some pages that have tabular data.</td></tr></table>
            <p>Blah, blah, here's more after&hellip;</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="jumpback"></div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="layout">
      <div class="contenttable">
        <div class="navback"></div>
        <div class="contentholder">
          <div class="nav">This is the navigation bar. Links and stuff go here to let people navigate yo. In some sites, with lots of areas, this could be quite long. In theory this column should cause the height of the jump points and content to resize if it gets long enough. <code>Float</code>ed elements do take part in the normal flow&hellip; No, wait, they don't&hellip; Why does this work?</div>
          <div class="jump">This is the right column. It has jump points for different areas of the site.</div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Some test content outside of the table.</p>
            <table><tr><td>This is the actual content. It is in a table because I can't keep the <a href="http://www.kintera.org">retarded <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym></a> from sticking the tags in the output.

            <p>Blah, blah, here's more after&hellip;</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="jumpback"></div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="layout">
      <div class="contenttable">
        <div class="navback"></div>
        <div class="contentholder">
          <div class="nav">This is the navigation bar. Links and stuff go here to let people navigate yo.</div>
          <div class="jump">This is the right column. It has jump points for different areas of the site. Apparently even though it is <code>float</code> it seems to be in the normal flow without any extra trickery. That seems counter to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#floats">the spec</a>. I reckon I need to test this out in something other than <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Firefox</a>. Well, it works in <a href="http://konqueror.kde.org">Konqueror</a> too.</div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Some test content outside of the table.</p>

    <p>So, the display is the same in Safari and a bug in Opera makes the side columns disappear completely. What is irritating is Firefox is acting up again. I was doing this to deal with an <a href="../test_css_table_display.html">arguable bug</a> in the <code>table-cell</code> <code>display</code> where there is a nested <code>table</code>. Now, look at what it does with a nested <code>form</code>: <em>(Nothing is changed other than adding the form.)</em></p>


    <div class="layout">
      <div class="contenttable">
        <div class="navback"></div>
        <div class="contentholder">
          <div class="nav">This is the navigation bar. Links and stuff go here to let people navigate yo.</div>
          <div class="jump">This is the right column. It has jump points for different areas of the site. A common way to handle jump points is with a <code>form</code>:
          <p>Where would you like to go?</p>
          <form action="">
            <div>
              <select name="location">
                <option value="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</option>
                <option value="http://www.google.com">Google</option>
                <option value="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</option>
                <option value="http://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</option>
              </select>
            </div>
          </form>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Some test content outside of the table.</p>
            <table><tr><td>This is the actual content. It is in a table because I can't keep the <a href="http://www.kintera.org">retarded <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym></a> from sticking the tags in the output. (And to be fair, I also have some pages that have tabular data.</td></tr></table>
            <p>Blah, blah, here's more after&hellip;</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="jumpback"></div>
      </div>
