\title{Testing Arabic Characters in \LaTeX}

\author{Will Holcomb}

\begin{abstract}
In unicode there are certain characters called ``combining
dicriticals'' and they do not produce a character directly, but rather
combine with the previous character to produce a single character of
output. For example, the letter é can be produced with the single
character é or with the character e followed by the combining
dicritical '.

A character set for which these dicriticals is important is arabic.
Arabic includes a set of dicriticals that allow one to precisly
describe the pronounciation of a word. It is possible to write words
without using these marks apparently, but you must recognize the word
in order to know how to pronounce it.

So, for someone working on a dirctionary in Arabic for example these
marks are very important. I need to be able to produce them and right
now I am unable to in mozilla in html under linux. I am hoping that
perhaps \LaTeX has the ability.
