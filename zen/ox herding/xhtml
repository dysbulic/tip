	<p>Ox has never really gone astray, so why search for it? Having turned his back on his True-nature, the man cannot see it. Because of his defilements he has lost sight of the Ox. Suddenly he finds himself confronted by a maze of crisscrossing roads. Greed for worldly gain and dread of loss spring up like searing flames, ideas of right and wrong dart out like daggers.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>Desolate through forests and fearful in jungles,</span>
		<span class="cont">he is seeking an Ox which he does not find.</span>
		<span>Up and down dark, nameless, wide-flowing rivers,</span>
		<span class="cont">in deep mountain thickets he treads many bypaths.</span>
		<span>Bone-tired, heart-weary, he carries on his search</span>
		<span class="cont">for this something which he yet cannot find.</span>
		<span>At evening he hears cicadas chirping in the trees.</span>

	<p>Through the sutras and teachings he discerns the tracks of the Ox. [He has been informed that just as] different shaped [golden] vessels are all basically of the same gold, so each and every thing is a manifestation of the Self. But he is unable to distinguish good from evil, truth from falsity. He has not actually entered the gate, but he sees in a tentative way the tracks of the Ox.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>Innumerable footprints has he seen</span>
		<span class="cont">in the forest and along the water's edge.</span>
		<span>Over yonder does he see the trampled grass?</span>
		<span>Even the deepest gorges of the topmost mountains</span>
		<span class="cont">can't hide this Ox's nose which reaches right to heaven.</span>

	<p>If he will but listen intently to everyday sounds, he will come to realization and at that instant see the very Source. The six senses are no different from this true Source. In every activity the Source is manifestly present. It is analogous to the salt in water or the binder in paint. When the inner vision is properly focused, one comes to realize that that which is seen is identical with the true Source.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>A nightingale warbles on a twig,</span>
		<span class="cont">the sun shines on undulating willows.</span>
		<span>There stands the Ox, where could he hide?</span>
		<span>That splendid head, those stately horns,</span>
		<span class="cont">what artist could portray them?</span>

	<p>Today he encountered the Ox, which had long been cavorting in the wild fields, and actually grasped it. For so long a time has it reveled in these surroundings that breaking it of its old habits is not easy. It continues to yearn for sweet-scented grasses. It is still stubborn and unbridled. If he would tame it completely, the man must use his whip.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>He must tightly grasp the rope and not let it go,</span>
		<span class="cont">for the Ox still has unhealthy tendencies.</span>
		<span>Now he charges up to the highlands,</span>
		<span class="cont">now he loiters in a misty ravine.</span>

	<p>With the rising of one thought another and another are born. Enlightenment brings the realization that such thoughts are not unreal since even they arise from our True-nature. It is only because delusion still remains that they are imagined to be unreal. This state of delusion does not originate in the objective world but in our own minds.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>He must hold the nose-rope tight and not allow the Ox to roam,</span>
		<span class="cont">lest off to muddy haunts it should stray.</span>
		<span>Properly tended, it becomes clean and gentle.</span>
		<span>Untethered, it willingly follows in master.</span>

	<p>The struggle is over; "gain" and "loss" no longer affect him. He hums the rustic tune of the woodsman and plays the simple songs of the village children. Astride the Ox's back, he gazes serenely at the clouds above. His head does not turn [in the direction of temptations]. Try though one may to upset him, he remains undisturbed.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>Riding free as air he buoyantly comes home</span>
		<span class="cont">through evening mists in wide straw-hat and cape.</span>
		<span>Wherever he may go he creates a fresh breeze,</span>
		<span class="cont">while in his heart profound tranquility prevails.</span>
		<span>This Ox requires not a blade of grass.</span>

	<p>In the Dharma there is no two-ness. The Ox is his Primal-nature: this he has now recognized. A trap is no longer needed when a rabbit has been caught; a net becomes useless when a fish has been snared. Like gold which has been separated from dross, like the moon which has broken through the clouds, one ray of luminous Light shines eternally.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>Only on the Ox was he able to come Home,</span>
		<span>But lo, the Ox is now vanished, and alone and serene</span>
		<span class="cont">sits the man.</span>
		<span>The red sun rides high in the sky</span>
		<span class="cont">as he dreams on placidly.</span>
		<span>Yonder beneath the thatched roof</span>
		<span class="cont">his idle whip and idle rope are lying.</span>

	<p>All delusive feelings have perished and ideas of holiness too have vanished. He lingers not in [the sure of "I am a] Buddha," and he passes quickly on through [the stage of "And now l have purged myself of the proud feeling "I am] not Buddha." Even the thousand eyes [of five hundred Buddhas and patriarchs] can discern in him no specific quality. If hundreds of birds were now to strew flowers about his room, he could not but feel ashamed of himself.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>Whip, rope, Ox and man alike belong to Emptiness.</span>
		<span>So vast and infinite the azure sky</span>
		<span class="cont">that no concept of any sort can reach it.</span>

		<span>When this state of mind is realized</span>

	<p>From the very beginning there has not been so much as a speck of dust [to mar the intrinsic Purity]. He observes the waxing and waning of life in the world while abiding unassertively in a state of unshakable serenity. This [waxing and waning] is no phantom or illusion [but a manifestation of the Source]. Why then is there need to strive for anything? The waters are blue, the mountains are green. Alone with himself, he observes things endlessly changing.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>He has returned to the Origin, come back to the Source,</span>
		<span class="cont">but his steps have been taken in vain.</span>
		<span>It is as though he were now blind and deaf.</span>
		<span>Seated in his hut, he hankers not for things outside.</span>
		<span>Streams meander on of themselves,</span>
		<span class="cont">red flowers naturally bloom red.</span>

	<p>The gate of his cottage is closed and even the wisest cannot find him. His mental panorama has finally disappeared. He goes his own way, making no attempt to follow the steps of earlier sages. Carrying a gourd, he strolls into the market; leaning on his staff, he returns home. He leads innkeepers and fishmongers in the Way of the Buddha.</p>
	
	<div class="poem">
		<span>Barechested, barefooted, he comes into the marketplace.</span>
		<span>Muddied and dust-covered, how broadly he grins!</span>
		<span>Without recourse to mystic powers,</span>
		<span class="cont">withered trees he swiftly brings to bloom.</span>
