      <p>We're back! And this week, we're listening to three short pieces from Ghana &mdash; "Storytime," "Sweeping with Simone" and "Daniel in the Market" &mdash; sent to us by our friend and Producer Amara Hark-Weber. Amara recorded these while working as a <a href="http://cds.aas.duke.edu/hine/fellowslist.html">Hines Documentary Fellow</a> in Ghana. We looking forward to hearing more tape from Amara before she returns to the States.</p>
