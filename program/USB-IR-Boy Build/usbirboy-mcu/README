USB-IR-BOY firmware sources
----------------------------

2005-05-02 / AT:

For your convenience, the hex file is available in ../mcubin 
(compiled with CodeWarrior).
 
If you want to compile it yourself, you can use either SDCC or 
Metrowerks CodeWarrior for HC08. However:
- the hex file compiled with SDCC does not work at the moment
- CodeWarrior is only available on Windows, but the stand alone 
compiler and linker run under Wine (the IDE apparently does not).


Building firmware (using CodeWarrior and Wine):
-----------------------------------------------

1. Install Wine, then install CodeWarrior (and its license file)

2. run ./configure.cw

3. run make


Building firmware (using sdcc):
---------------------------------

1. Install SDCC (sdcc.sourceforge.net)
 
2. run ./configure.sdcc

3. run make


Burning MCU flash using commercial prommer hardware:
 - refer to prommer user manual how to use it

Burning MCU flash using prommer provided by usbirboy project:
---------------------------------------------------------------

First! Get Spgmr08 ( and see that it is fully working )

    1.  Start promming software :
      $ ./spgmr -P /dev/ttySn
      Where n is 0 for COM1 and 1 for COM2 etc.

   2. Select CPU type:
       cpu jb8

   3. Power on the prommer

   4. Clear secure codes: (this will fail but that's ok)
       scodes try blank

   5. Erase device:
       erase

   6. Power off the prommer

   7. Power on the pormmer

   8. Clear secure codes:
       scodes try blank
      (NOTE: for new, never programmed chip you need to repeat steps 4-8 two times)

   9. Program your hex image:
       program from /path/to/usbirboy.s19 

   10. Exit spgmr08 by pressing Ctrl-D.

 Thats it. Have fun.
