    <h1><acronym title="Digital Command Language">DCL</acronym> Scripts</h1>
    
    <p>My very first programming language ever was <acronym
    title="Digital Command Language">DCL</acronym> on <a
    href="http://www.tntech.edu">my university</a>'s <acronym
    title="Virtual Address eXtension">VAX</acronym> system running
    <acronym title="Virtual Memory System">VMS</acronym>.</p>

    <p>There was a login script that we edited as part of our
    introduction to <a href="http://honors.tntech.edu">Honors</a>.
    Once I found out that these programs were just text files, I
    started messing about with them and generally breaking them since
    I had no clue what I was doing. With time I learned to make
    backups and my understanding slowly progressed.</p>

    <p>With time my l33t skilz developed and by the time I left I had
    replaced all of the utilities provided by the honors programs with
    improved versions of my own. I'd guess maybe 30% of the users on
    the system were running programs out of my account.</p>

    <p>The VMS system at TTU is on an Alpha now, but still around. The
    students no longer get a login however. So, alas these are just
    here for the history.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="getnames.com"><code>getnames.com</code></a>: takes a list of usernames and aliases from a file and defines both logical names and symbols for the aliases so they can be used in <code>mail</code> and at the command line</li>
     <li><a href="who.com"><code>who.com</code></a>: searches for a list of users out of all those logged in and gives you a popularity rating</li>
     <li><a href="graph.com"><code>graph.com</code></a>: displays a little graph of available and used quota space</li>
     <li><a href="process.com"><code>process.com</code></a>: let a user customize their process name either manually of randomly out of a list</li>
     <li><a href="run_helpdesk.com"><code>run_helpdesk.com</code></a>: notifies helpdeskers of when it is time to run their <a href="../helpdesk/">checkin utilities</a></li>
     <li><a href="helpdesk.com"><code>helpdesk.com</code></a>: defines logical names used by the <a href="../helpdesk/">checkin utilities</a></li>
     <li><a href="diswho.com"><code>diswho.com</code></a>: same as <a href="who.com"><code>who.com</code></a>, but searches for users from a mail distribution list</li>
     <li><a href="set_security.com"><code>set_security.com</code></a>: VMS includes <acronym title="Access Control List">ACL</acronym> support. This program gives a set of users special permissions to a specified file</li>
     <li><a href="login.com"><code>login.com</code></a>: my login script looked like shortly before I finally graduated</li>
    </ul>
